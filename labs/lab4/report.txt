run with n = 10000
1n push operation seems to be a large outlier. 
The other numers seem reasonable but have a relitivly large variation.
Large O(n) valuse are muh cloaser to what i would expect from this function.
the O(1) values are around the same magnatude (ish).
and the O(n) seem to increse with n (for the most part).

Most of the "intresting" problems I encountered invloved how much bash sucks.
It is dificult to format strings and I still havent figured out how to output to a varible file name without thowing errors.
I now realize it would have been MUCH eiser to just write another java program to do the testing for me.
I also leaned that writing paragraphs in vim is quite unpleasant and my spelling is worse than I though.
