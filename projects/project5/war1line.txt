His moth- \ner died when he was three and his father six \nyears later. Placed in the care of his aunts, he \npassed many of his early years at Kazan, where, \nin 1844, after a preliminary training by French \ntutors, he entered the university. He cared lit- \ntle for the university and in 1847 withdrew be- \ncause of "ill-health and domestic circum- \nstances." He had, however, done a great deal \nof reading, of French, English, and Russian \nnovels, the New Testament, Voltaire, and \nHegel. The author exercising the greatest in- \nfluence upon him at this time was Rousseau; \nhe read his complete works and for sometime \nwore about his neck a medallion of Rousseau. \n\nImmediately upon leaving the university, \nTolstoy returned to his estate and, perhaps inr \nspired by his enthusiasm for Rousseau, pre- \npared to devote himself to agriculture and to \nimproving the condition of his serfs. His first \nattempt at social reform proved disappointing, \nand after six months he withdrew to Moscow \nand St. Petersburg, where he gave himself over \nto the irregular life characteristic of his class \nand time. In 1851, determined to "escape my \ndebts and, more than anything else, my hab- \nits," he enlisted in the Army as a gentleman- \nvolunteer, and went to the Caucasus. While at \nTiflis, preparing for his examinations as a \ncadet, he wrote the first portion of the trilogy, \nChildhood, Boyhood, and Youth, in which he \ncelebrated the happiness of "being with Na- \nture, seeing her, communing with her." He al- \nso began The Cossacks with the intention of \nshowing that culture is the enemy of happi- \nness. Although continuing his army life, he \ngradually came to realize that "a military ca- \nreer is not for me, and the sooner I get out of \nit and devote myself entirely to literature the \nbetter." His Sevastopol Sketches (1855) were \nso successful that Czar Nicholas issued special \norders that he should be removed from a post \nof danger. \n\nReturning to St. Petersburg, Tolstoy was re- \nceived with great favor in both the official and \nliterary circles of the capital. He soon became \n\n\n\ninterested in the popular progressive move- \nment of the time, and in 1857 he decided to go \nabroad and study the educational and munici- \npal systems of other countries. That year, and \nagain in 1860, he traveled in Europe. At Yas- \nnaya Polyana in 1861 he liberated his serfs and \nopened a school, established on the principle \nthat "everything which savours of compulsion \nis harmful." He started a magazine to promote \nhis notions on education and at the same time \nserved as an official arbitrator for grievances \nbetween the nobles and the recently emanci- \npated serfs. By the end of 1863 he was so ex- \nhausted that he discontinued his activities and \nretired to the steppes to drink koumis for his \nhealth. \n\nTolstoy had been contemplating marriage \nfor some time, and in 1862 he married Sophie \nBehrs, sixteen years his junior, and the daugh- \nter of a fashionable Moscow doctor. Their \nearly married life at Yasnaya Polyana was \ntranquil. Family cares occupied the Countess, \nand in the course of her life she bore thirteen \nchildren, nine of whom survived infancy. Yet \nshe also acted as a copyist for her husband, \nwho after their marriage turned again to writ- \ning. He was soon at work upon "a novel of \nthe i8io's and *2o's" which absorbed all his \ntime and effort. He went frequently to Mos- \ncow, "studying letters, diaries, and traditions" \nand "accumulated a whole library" of histori- \ncal material on the period. He interviewed \nsurvivors of the battles of that time and trav- \neled to Borodino to draw up a map of the \nbattleground. Finally, in 1869, after his work \nhad undergone several changes in conception \nand he had "spent five years of uninterrupted \nandjgxceptionally strenuous labor Tnnierthe \nIbesfcondUtions of life/' he published War and \nPeace. Its appearance immediately established \nTolstoy's reputation, and in the judgment of \nTurgenev, the acknowledged dean of Russian \nletters, gave him "first place among all our \ncontemporary writers." \n\nThe years immediately following the com- \npletion of War and Peace were pa**efl in a \ngreat variety of occupations, none of which \nTohtoy found satisfying. He tried busying \n\n\n\nVI \n\n\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL NOTE \n\n\n\nhimself with the affairs of his estate, under- \ntook the learning of Greek to read the ancient \nclassics, turned again to education, wrote a \nseries of elementary school books, and served \nas school inspector. With much urging from \nhis wife and friends, he completed Anna Kare- \nnina, which appeared serially between 1875 \nand 1877. Disturbed by what he considered his \nunreflective and prosperous existence, Tolstoy \nbecame increasingly interested in religion. At \nfirst he turned to the orthodox faith of the \npeople. Unable to find rest there, he began a \ndetailed examination of religions, and out of \nhis reading, particularly of the Gospels, gradu- \nally evolved his own personal doctrine. \n\nFollowing his conversion, Tolstoy adopted \na new mode of life. He dressed like a peasant, \ndevoted much of his time to manual work, \nlearned shoemaking, and followed a vegetari- \nan diet. With the exception of his youngest \ndaughter, Alexandra, Tolstoy's family re- \nmained hostile to his teaching. The breach be- \ntween him and his wife grew steadily wider. \nIn 1879 he wrote the Kreutzer Sonata in which \nhe attacked the normal state of marriage and \nextolled a life of celibacy and chastity. In 1881 \nhe divided his estate among his heirs and, a \nfew years later, despite the opposition of his \nwife, announced that he would forego royal- \nties on all the works published after his con- \nversion. \n\nTolstoy made no attempt at first to propa- \ngate his religious teaching, although it attracted \n\n\n\nmany followers. After a visit to the Moscow \nslums iri 1881, he became concerned with social \nconditions, and he subsequently aided the suf- \nferers of the famine by sponsoring two hun- \ndred and fifty relief kitchens. After his meet- \ning and intimacy with Chertkov, "Tolstoyism" \nbegan to develop as an organized sect. Tol- \nstoy's writings became almost exclusively pre- \noccupied with religious problems. In addition \nto numerous pamphlets and plays, he wrote \nIV hat is Art? (1896), in which he explained \nhis new aesthetic theories, and Hadji-Murad, \n(1904), which became the favorite work of his \nold age. Although his activities were looked \nupon with increasing suspicion by the official \nauthorities, Tolstoy escaped official censure \nuntil 1901, when he was excommunicated by \nthe Orthodox Church. His followers were f re- \nquently subjected to persecution, and many \nwere either banished or imprisoned. \n\nTolstoy's last years were embittered by \nmounting hostility within his own household. \nAlthough his personal life was ascetic, he felt \nthe ambiguity of his position as a preacher of \npoverty living on his great estate. Finally, at \nthe age of eighty-two, with the aid of his daugh- \nter, Alexandra, he fled from home. His health \nbroke down a few days later, and he was re- \nmoved from the train to the station-master's \nhut at Astopovo, where he died, November 7, \n1910. He was buried at Yasnaya Polyana, in \nthe first public funeral to be held in Russia \nwithout religious rites. \n\n\n\nCONTEXTS \n\n\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL NOTE v \n\nThe Principal Characters in War and Peace \n\nArranged in Family Groups xv \n\nDates of Principal Historical Events xvi \n\nBOOK ONE \n\n1-5.

But I \nwarn you, if you don't tell me that this means \nwar, if you still try to defend the infamies and \nhorrors perpetrated by that Antichrist I real- \nly believe he is Antichrist I will have nothing \nmore to do with you and you are no longer my \nfriend, no longer my 'faithful slave,' as you \ncall yourself! But how do you do? I see I have \nfrightened you sit down and tell me all the \nnews." \n\nIt was in July, 1805, and the speaker was the \nwell-known Anna Pdvlovna Sch^rer, maid of \nhonor and favorite of the Empress Marya Fe- \ndorovna. With these words she greeted Prince \nVasili Kurdgin, a man of high rank and impor- \ntance, who was the first to arrive at her recep- \ntion. Anna Pdvlovna had had a cough for some \ndays. She was, as she said, suffering from la \ngrippe; grippe being then a new word in St. \nPetersburg, used only by the elite. \n\nAll her invitations without exception, writ- \nten in French, and delivered by a scarlet-liver- \nied footman that morning, ran as follows: \n\n"If you have nothing better to do, Count [or \nPrince], and if the prospect of spending an \nevening with a poor invalid is not too terrible, \nI shall be very charmed to see you tonight be- \ntween 7 and 10 Annette Sch^rer." \n\n"Heavens! what a virulent attack!" replied \nthe prince, not in the least disconcerted by this \nreception. He had just entered, wearing an em- \nbroidered court uniform, knee breeches, and \nshoes, and had stars on his breast and a serene \nexpression on his flat face. He spoke in that \nrefined French in which our grandfathers not \nonly spoke but thought, and with the gentle, \npatronizing intonation natural to a man of \nimportance who had grown old in society and \nat court. He went up to Anna Pavlovna, kissed \nher hand, presenting to her his bald, scented, \nand shining head, and complacently seated \nhimself on the sofa. \n\n"First of all, dear friend, tell me how you \n\n\n\nare. Set your friend's mind at rest," said he \nwithout altering his tone, beneath the polite- \nness and affected sympathy of which indiffer- \nence and even irony could be discerned. \n\n"Can one be well while suffering morally? \nCan one be calm in tirrfes like these if one has \nany feeling?" said Anna Pdvlovna. "You are \nstaying the whole evening, I hope?" \n\n"And the fete at the English ambassador's? \nToday is Wednesday. I must put in an appear- \nance there," said the prince. "My daughter is \ncoming for me to take me there." \n\n"I thought today's fete had been canceled. \nI confess all these festivities and fireworks are \nbecoming wearisome." \n\n"If they had known that you wished it, the \nentertainment would have been put off," said \nthe prince, who, like a wound-up clock, by \nforce of habit said things he did not even wish \nto be believed. \n\n"Don't tease! Well, and what has been de- \ncided about Novosiltsev's dispatch? You know \neverything." \n\n"What can one say about it?" replied the \nprince in a cold, listless tone. "What has been \ndecided? They have decided that Buonaparte \nhas burnt his boats, and I believe that we are \nready to burn ours." \n\nPrince Vastti always spoke languidly, like \nan actor repeating a stale part. Anna Pdvlovna \nScherer on the contrary, despite her forty years, \noverflowed with animation and impulsiveness. \nTo be an enthusiast had become her social vo- \ncation and, sometimes even when she did not \nfeel like it, she became enthusiastic in order \nnot to disappoint the expectations of those \nwho knew her. The subdued smile which, \nthough it did not suit her faded features, al- \nways played round her lips expressed, as in a \nspoiled child, a continual consciousness of her \ncharming defect, which she neither wished, nor \ncould, nor considered it necessary, to correct. \n\nIn the midst of a conversation on political \nmatters Anna Pdvlovna burst out: \n\n"Oh, don't speak to me of Austria. Perhaps \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nI don't understand things, but Austria never \nhas wished, and does not wish, for war. She is \nbetraying us! Russia alone must save Europe. \nOur gracious sovereign recognizes his high vo- \ncation and will be true to it. That is the one \nthing I have faith in! Our good and wonder- \nful sovereign has to perfonn the noblest role \non earth, and he is so virtuous and noble that \nGod will not forsake him. He will fulfill his \nvocation and crush the hydra of revolution, \nwhich has become more terrible than ever in \nthe person of this murderer and villain! We \nalone must avenge the blood of the just one. \n. . . Whom, I ask you, can we rely on? . . . Eng- \nland with her commercial spirit will not and \ncannot understand the Emperor Alexander's \nloftiness of soul. She tias refused to evacuate \nMalta. She wanted to find, and still seeks, some \nsecret motive in our actions. What answer did \nNovosiltsev get? None. The English have not \nunderstood and cannot understand the self- \nabnegation of our Emperor who wants noth- \ning for himself, but only desires the good of \nmankind. And what have they promised? Noth- \ning! And what little they have promised they \nwill not perform! Prussia has always declared \nthat Buonaparte is invincible and that all \nEurope is powerless before him. . . . And I \ndon't believe a word that Hardenburg says, \nor Haugwitz either. This famous Prussian neu- \ntrality is just a trap. I have faith only in God \nand the lofty destiny of our adored monarch. \nHe will save Europe!" \n\nShe suddenly paused, smiling at her own \nimpetuosity. \n\n"I think," said the prince with a smile, "that \nif you had been sent instead of our dear \nWintzingerode you would have captured the \nKing of Prussia's consent by assault. You are \nso eloquent. Will you give me a cup of tea?" \n\n"In a moment. X propos"she added, becom- \ning calm again, "I am expecting two very in- \nteresting men tonight, le Vicomte de Morte- \nmart, who is connected with the Montmoren- \ncys through the Rohans,oneof the best French \nfamilies. He is one of the genuine dmigrh, the \ngood ones. And also the Abbe* Morio. Do you \nknow that profound thinker? He has been re- \nceived by the Emperor. Had you heard?" \n\n"I shall be delighted to meet them," said the \nprince. "But tell me," he added with studied \ncarelessness as if it had only just occurred to \nhim, though the question he was about to ask \nwas the chief motive of his visit, "is it true that \nthe Dowager Empress wants Baron Funke to be \nappointed first secretary at Vienna? The baron \n\n\n\nby all accounts is a poor creature." \n\nPrince Vasfli wished to obtain this post for \nhis son, but others were trying through the \nDowager Empress Mdrya Fedorovna to secure \nit for the baron. \n\nAnna Pdvlovna almost closed her eyes to in- \ndicate that neither she nor anyone else had a \nright to criticize what the Empress desired or \nwas pleased with. \n\n"Baron Funke has been recommended to the \nDowager Empress by her sister," was all she \nsaid, in a dry and mournful tone. \n\nAs she named the Empress, Anna Pdvlovna's \nface suddenly assumed an expression of pro- \nfound and sincere devotion and respect min- \ngled with sadness, and thisoccurred every time \nshe mentioned her illustrious patroness. She \nadded that Her Majesty had deigned to show \nBaron Funke beaucoup d'estime, and again \nher face clouded over with sadness. \n\nThe prince was silent and looked indiffer- \nent. But, with the womanly and courtierlike \nquickness and tact habitual to her, Anna Pdv- \nlovna wished both to rebuke him (for daring \nto speak as he had done of a man recommended \nto the Empress) and at the same time to con- \nsole him, so she said: \n\n"Now about your family. Do you know that \nsince your daughter came out everyone has \nbeen enraptured by her? They say she is amaz- \ningly beautiful." \n\nThe prince bowed to signify his respect and \ngratitude. \n\n"I often think," she continued after a short \npause, drawing nearer to the prince and smil- \ning amiably at him as if to show that political \nand social topics were ended and the time had \ncome for intimate conversation "I often think \nhow unfairly sometimes the joys of life are dis- \ntributed. Why has fate given you two such \nsplendid children? I don't speak of Anatole, \nyour youngest. I don't like him," she added in \na tone admitting of no rejoinder and raising \nher eyebrows. "Two such charming children. \nAnd really you appreciate them less than any- \none, and so you don't deserve to have them." \n\nAnd she smiled her ecstatic smile. \n\n"I can't help it," said the prince. "Lavater \nwould have said I lack the bump of paternity." \n\n"Don't joke; I mean to have a serious talk \nwith you. Do you know I am dissatisfied with \nyour younger son? Between ourselves" (and \nher face assumed its melancholy expression), \n"he was mentioned at Her Majesty's and you \nwere pitied. . . ." \n\nThe prince answered nothing, but she \n\n\n\nBOOK ONE \n\n\n\nlooked at him significantly, awaiting a reply. \nHe frowned. \n\n"What would you have me do?" he said at \nlast. "You know I did all a father could for \ntheir education, and they have both turned \nout fools. Hippolyte is at least a quiet fool, but \nAnatole is an active one. That is the only dif- \nference between them." He said this smiling \nin a way more natural and animated than \nusual, so that the wrinkles round his mouth \nvery clearly revealed something unexpectedly \ncoarse and unpleasant. \n\n"And why are children born to such men as \nyou? If you were not a father there would be \nnothing I could reproach you with," said Anna \nPdvlovna, looking up pensively. \n\n"I am your faithful slave and to you alone I \ncan confess that my children are the bane of \nmy life. It is the cross I have to bear. That is \nhow I explain it to myself. It can't be helped!" \n\nHe said no more, but expressed his resigna- \ntion to cruel fate by a gesture. Anna Pdvlovna \nmeditated. \n\n"Have you never thought of marrying your \nprodigal son Anatole?" she asked. "They say \nold maids have a mania for matchmaking, and \nthough I don't feel that weakness in myself as \nyet, I know a little person who is very unhappy \nwith her father. She is a relation of yours, \nPrincess Mary Bolk6nskaya." \n\nPrince Vasili did not reply, though, with the \nquickness of memory and perception befitting \na man of the world, he indicated by a move- \nment of the head that he was considering this \ninformation. \n\n"Do you know," he said at last, evidently \nunable to check the sad current of his thoughts, \n"that Anatole is costing me forty thousand \nrubles a year? And," he went on after a pause, \n"what will it be in five years, if he goes on like \nthis?" Presently he added: "That's what we \n\nfathers have to put up with Is this princess \n\nof yours rich?" \n\n"Her father is very rich and stingy. He lives \nin the country. He is the well-known Prince \nBolk6nski who had to retire from the army un- \nder the late Emperor, and was nicknamed 'the \nKing of Prussia.' He is very clever but eccen- \ntric, and a bore. The poor girl is very unhappy. \nShe has a brother; I think you know him, he \nmarried Lise Meinen lately. He is an aide-de- \ncamp of Kutiizov's and will be here tonight." \n\n"Listen, dear Annette," said the prince, sud- \ndenly taking Anna Pdvlovna's hand and for \nsome reason drawing it downwards. "Arrange \nthat affair for me and I shall always be your \n\n\n\nmost devoted slave slaje with an /, as a village \nelder of mine writes in his reports. She is rich \nand of good family and that's all I want." \n\nAnd with the familiarity and easy grace \npeculiar to him, he raised the maid of honor's \nhand to his lips, kissed it, and swung it to and \nfro as he lay back in his armchair, looking in \nanother direction. \n\n"Attendee" said Anna Pdvlovna, reflecting, \n"I'll speak to Lise, young Bolk6nski's wife, this \nvery evening, and perhaps the thing can be \narranged. It shall be on your family's behalf \nthat I'll start my apprenticeship as old maid." \n\nCHAPTER II \n\nANNA PAVLOVNA'S drawing room was gradually \nfilling. The highest Petersburg society was as- \nsembled there: people differing widely in age \nand character but alike in the social circle to \nwhich they belonged. Prince Vasili's daughter, \nthe beautiful Hlne, came to take her father \nto the ambassador's entertainment; she wore a \nball dress and her badge as maid of honor. The \nyouthful little Princess Bolkonskaya, known \nas la femme la plus sSduisante de Pfaersbourg? \nwas also there. She had been married during \nthe previous winter, and being pregnant did \nnot go to any large gatherings, but only to small \nreceptions. Prince Vasfli's son, Hippolyte, had \ncome with Mortemart, whom he introduced. \nThe Abb6 Morio and many others had also \ncome. \n\nTo each new arrival Anna Pdvlovna safcl, \n"You have not yet seen my aunt," or "You do \nnot know my aunt?" and very gravely con- \nducted him or her to a little old lady, wearing \nlarge bows of ribbon in her cap, who had come \nsailing in from another room as soon as the \nguests began to arrive; and slowly turning her \neyes from the visitor to her aunt, Anna Pdv- \nlovna mentioned each one's name and then \nleft them. \n\nEach visitor performed the ceremony of \ngreeting this old aunt whom not one of them \nknew, not one of them wanted to know, and \nnot one of them cared about; Anna Pdvlovna \nobserved these greetings with mournful and sol- \nemn interest and silent approval. The aunt \nspoke to each of them in the same words, about \ntheir health and her own, and the health of \nHer Majesty, "who, thank God, was better to- \nday." And each visitor, though politeness pre- \nvented his showing impatience, left the old \nwoman with a sense of relief at having per- \nformed a vexatious duty and did not return to \n\n1 The most fascinating woman in Petersburg. \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nher the whole evening. \n\nThe young Princess Bolk6nskaya had \nbrought some work in a gold-embroidered vel- \nvet bag. Her pretty little upper lip, on which \na delicate dark down was just perceptible, was \ntoo short for her teeth, but it lifted all the more \nsweetly, and was especially charming when she \noccasionally drew it down to meet the lower \nlip. As is always the case with a thoroughly at- \ntractive woman, her defectthe shortness of \nher upperlip and her half-open mouth seemed \nto be her own special and peculiar form of \nbeauty. Everyone brightened at the sight of \nthis pretty young woman, so soon to become \na mother, so full of life and health, and carry- \ning her burden so lightly. Old men and dull \ndispirited young ones who looked at her, after \nbeing in her company and talking to her a \nlitttle while, felt as if they too were becoming, \nlike her, full of life and health. All who talked \nto her, and at each word saw her bright smile \nand the constant gleam of her white teeth, \nthought that they were in a specially amiable \nmood that day. \n\nThe little princess went round the table \nwith quick, short, swaying steps, her workbag \non her arm, and gaily spreading out her dress \nsat down on a sofa near the silver samovar, as \nif all she was doing was a pleasure to herself \nand to all around her. "I have brought my \nwork," said she in French, displaying her bag \nand addressing all present. "Mind, Annette, \nI hope you have not played a wicked trick on \nme," she added, turning to her hostess. "You \nwrote that it was to be quite a small reception, \nand just see how badly I am dressed." And she \nspread out her arms to show her short-waisted, \nlace-trimmed, dainty gray dress, girdled with \na broad ribbon just below the breast. \n\n"Soyez tranquille, Lise, you will always be \nprettier than anyone else," replied Anna Pdv- \nlovna. \n\n"You know/' said the princess in the same \ntone of voice and still in French, turning to a \ngeneral, "my husband is deserting me? He is \ngoing to get himself killed. Tell me what this \nwretched war is for?" she added, addressing \nPrince Vasfli, and without waiting for an an- \nswer she turned to speak to his daughter, the \nbeautiful Hlne. \n\n"What a delightful woman this little prin- \ncess isl" said Prince Vasili to Anna Pdvlovna. \n\nOne of the next arrivals was a stout, heavily \nbuilt young man with close-cropped hair, spec- \ntacles, the light-colored breeches fashionable \nat that time, a very high ruffle, and a brown \n\n\n\ndress coat. This stout young man was an illegit- \nimate son^of Count Bezukhov, a well-known \ngrandee of Catherine's time who now lay dy- \ning in Moscow. The young man had not yet \nentered either the military or civil service, as \nhe had only just returned from abroad where \nhe had been educated, and this was his first ap- \npearance in society. Anna Pdvlovna greeted \nhim with the nod she accorded to the lowest \nhierarchy in her drawing room. But in spite of \nthis lowest-grade greeting, a look of anxiety \nand fear, as at the sight of something too large \nand unsuited to the place, came over her face \nwhen she saw Pierre enter. Though he was cer- \ntainly rather bigger than the other men in the \nroom, her anxiety could only have reference \nto the clever though shy, but observant and \nnatural, expression which distinguished him \nfrom everyone else in that drawing room. \n\n"It is very good of you, Monsieur Pierre, to \ncome and visit a poor invalid," said Anna Pdv- \nlovna, exchanging an alarmed glance with her \naunt as she conducted him to her. \n\nPierre murmured something unintelligible, \nand continued to look round as if in search of \nsomething. On his way to the aunt he bowed \nto the little princess with a pleased smile, as to \nan intimate acquaintance. \n\nAnna Pdvlovna's alarm was justified, for \nPierre turned away from the aunt without wait- \ning to hear her speech about Her Majesty's \nhealth. Anna Pdvlovna in dismay detained \nhim with the words: "Do you know the Abbe* \nMorio? He is a most interesting man." \n\n"Yes, I have heard of his scheme for perpet- \nual peace, and it is very interesting but hardly \nfeasible." \n\n"You think so?" rejoined Anna Pdvlovna in \norder to say something and get away to attend \nto her duties as hostess. But Pierre now com- \nmitted a reverse act of impoliteness. First he \nhad left a lady before she had finished speak- \ning to him, and now he continued to speak to \nanother who wished to getaway. With his head \nbent, and his big feet spread apart, he began \nexplaining his reasons for thinking the abbess \nplan chimerical. \n\n"We will talk of it later," said Anna Pdv- \nlovna with a smile. \n\nAnd having got rid of this young man who \ndid not know how to behave, she resumed her \nduties as hostess and continued to listen and \nwatch, ready to help at any point where the \nconversation might happen to flag. As the fore- \nman of a spinning mill, when he has set the \nhands to work, goes round and notices here a \n\n\n\nBOOK ONE \n\n\n\nspindle that has stopped or there one that \ncreaks or makes more noise than it should, and \nhastens to check the machine or set it in proper \nmotion, so Anna Pavlovna moved about her \ndrawing room, approaching now a silent, now \na too-noisy group, and by a word or slight re- \narrangement kept the conversational machine \nin steady, proper, and regular motion. But \namid these cares her anxiety about Pierre was \nevident. She kept an anxious watch on him \nwhen he approached the group round Morte- \nmart to listen to what was being said there, and \nagain when he passed to another group whose \ncenter was the abbe*. \n\nPierre had been educated abroad, and this \nreception at Anna Pavlovna's was the first he \nhad attended in Russia. He knew that all the \nintellectual lights of Petersburg were gathered \nthere and, like a child in a toyshop, did not \nknow which way to look, afraid of missing any \nclever conversation that was to be heard. See- \ning the self-confident and refined expression \non the faces of those present he was always ex- \npecting to hear something very profound. At \nlast he came up to Morio. Here the conversa- \ntion seemed interesting and he stood waiting \nfor an opportunity to express his own views, \nas young people are fond of doing. \n\nCHAPTER III \n\nANNA PAVLOVNA'S reception was in full swing. \nThe spindles hummed steadily and ceaselessly \non all sides. With the exception of the aunt, \nbeside whom sat only one elderly lady, who \nwith her thin careworn face was rather out of \nplace in this brilliant society, the whole com- \npany had settled into three groups. One, chiefly \nmasculine, had formed round the abbe". An- \nother, of young people, was grouped round \nthe beautiful Princess Hlne, Prince Vasfli's \ndaughter, and the little Princess Bolk6nskaya, \nvery pretty and rosy, though rather too plump \nfor her age. The third group was gathered \nround Mortemart and Anna Pavlovna. \n\nThe vicomte was a nice-looking young man \nwith soft features and polished manners, who \nevidently considered himself a celebrity but \nout of politeness modestly placed himself at \nthe disposal of the circle in which he found \nhimself. Anna Pdvlovna was obviously serving \nhim up as a treat to her guests. As a clever \nmaitre d'hotel serves up as a specially choice \ndelicacy a piece of meat that no one who had \nseen it in the kitchen would have cared to eat, \nso Anna Pavlovna served up to her guests, first \nthe vicomte and then the abbe*, as peculiarly \n\n\n\nchoice morsels. The group about Mortemart \nimmediately began discussing the murder of the \nDue d'Enghien. The vicomte said that the Due \nd'Enghien had perished by his own magna- \nnimity, and that there were particular reasons \nfor Buonaparte's hatred of him. \n\n"Ah, yes! Do tell us all about it, Vicomte," \nsaid Anna Pdvlovna, with a pleasant feeling \nthat there was something a la Louis XV in the \nsound of that sentence: "Contez nous gela, \nVicomte." \n\nThe vicomte bowed and smiled courteously \nin token of his willingness to comply. Anna \nPavlovna arranged a group round him, invit- \ning everyone to listen to his tale. \n\n"The vicomte knew the due personally," \nwhispered Anna Pdvlovna to one of the guests. \n"The vicomte is a wonderful raconteur," said \nshe to another. "How evidently he belongs to \nthe best society," said she to a third; and the \nvicomte was served up to the company in the \nchoicest and most advantageous style, like a \nwell-garnished joint of roast beef on a hot \ndish. \n\nThe vicomte wished to begin his story and \ngave a subtle smile. \n\n"Come over here, Hlne, dear," said Anna \nPvlovna to the beautiful young princess who \nwas sitting some way off, the center of another \ngroup. \n\nThe princess smiled. She rose with the same \nunchanging smile with which she had first en- \ntered the room the smile of a perfectly beauti- \nful woman. With a slight rustle of her white \ndress trimmed with moss and ivy, with a gleam \nof white shoulders, glossy hair, and sparkling \ndiamonds, she passed between the men who \nmade way for her, not looking at any of them \nbut smiling on all, as if graciously allowing \neach the privilege of admiring her beautiful \nfigure and shapely shoulders, back, and bosom \nwhich in the fashion of those days were very \nmuch exposed and she seemed to bring the \nglamour of a ballroom with her as she moved \ntoward Anna Pavlovna. Hlene was so lovely \nthat not only did she not show any trace of \ncoquetry, but on the contrary she even appeared \nshy of her unquestionable and all too victori- \nous beauty. She seemed to wish, but to be un- \nable, to diminish its effect. \n\n"How lovely!" said everyone who saw her; \nand the vicomte lifted his shoulders and \ndropped his eyes as if startled by something ex- \ntraordinary when she took her seat opposite and \nbeamed upon him also with her unchanging \nsmile. \n\n\n\n6 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\n"Madame, I doubt my ability before such \nan audience," said he, smilingly inclining his \nhead. \n\nThe princess rested her bare round arm on \na little table and considered a reply unneces- \nsary. She smilingly waited. All the time the \nstory was being told she sat upright, glancing \nnow at her beautiful round arm, altered in \nshape by its pressure on the table, now at her \nstill more beautiful bosom, on which she read- \njusted a diamond necklace. From time to time \nshe smoothed the folds of her dress, and when- \never the story produced an effect she glanced \nat Anna Pavlovna, at once adopted just the \nexpression she saw on the maid of honor's face, \nand again relapsed into her radiant smile. \n\nThe little princess had also left the tea table \nand followed Helne. \n\n"Wait a moment, I'll get my work. . . . Now \nthen, what are you thinking of?" she went on, \nturning to Prince Hippolyte. "Fetch me my \nworkbag." \n\nThere was a general movement as the prin- \ncess, smiling and talking merrily to everyone \nat once, sat down and gaily arranged herself in \nher seat. \n\n"Now I am all right," she said, and asking \nthe vicomte to begin, she took up her work. \n\nPrince Hippolyte, having brought the work- \nbag, joined the circle and moving a chair close \nto hers seated himself beside her. \n\nLe charmant Hippolyte was surprising by \nhis extraordinary resemblance to his beautiful \nsister, but yet more by the fact that in spite of \nthis resemblance he was exceedingly ugly. His \nfeatures were like his sister's, but while in her \ncase everything was lit up by a joyous, self- \nsatisfied, youthful, and constant smile of ani- \nmation, and by the wonderful classic beauty \nof her figure, his face on the contrary was \ndulled by imbecility and a constant expression \nof sullen self-confidence, while his body was \nthin and weak. His eyes, nose, and mouth all \nseemed puckered into a vacant, wearied gri- \nmace, and his arms and legs always fell into \nunnatural positions. \n\n"It's not going to be a ghost story?" said he, \nsitting down beside the princess and hastily \nadjusting his lorgnette, as if without this in- \nstrument he could not begin to speak. \n\n"Why no, my dear fellow," said the aston- \nished narrator, shrugging his shoulders. \n\n"Because I hate ghost stones," said Prince \nHippolyte in a tone which showed that he only \nunderstood die meaning of his words after he \nhad uttered them. \n\n\n\nHe spoke with such self-confidence that his \nhearers ould not be sure whether what he said \nwas very witty or very stupid. He was dressed \nin a dark-green dress coat, knee breeches of \nthe color of cuisse de nymphe effrayJe, as he \ncalled it, shoes, and silk stockings. \n\nThe vicomte told his tale very neatly. It was \nan anecdote, then current, to the effect that \nthe Due d'Enghien had gone secretly to Paris \nto visit Mademoiselle George; thatat her house \nhe came upon Bonaparte, who also enjoyed \nthe famous actress' favors, and that in his pres- \nence Napoleon happened to fall into one of \nthe fainting fits to which he was subject, and \nwas thus at the due's mercy. The latter spared \nhim, and this magnanimity Bonaparte subse- \nquently repaid by death. \n\nThe story was very pretty and interesting, \nespecially at the point where the rivals sud- \ndenly recognized one another; and the ladies \nlooked agitated. \n\n"Charming!" said Anna PAvlovna with an in- \nquiring glance at the little princess. \n\n"Charming!" whispered the little princess, \nsticking the needle into her work as if to testify \nthat the interest and fascination of the story \nprevented her from going on with it. \n\nThe vicomte appreciated this silent praise \nand smiling gratefully prepared to continue, \nbut just then Anna Pavlovna, who had kept a \nwatchful eye on the young man who so alarmed \nher, noticed that he was talking too loudly \nand vehemently with the abbe", so she hurried \nto the rescue. Pierre had managed to start a \nconversation with the abb about the balance \nof power, and the latter, evidently interested \nby the young man's simple-minded eagerness, \nwas explaining his pet theory. Both were talk- \ning and listening too eagerly and too naturally, \nwhich was why Anna Pavlovna disapproved. \n\n"The means are . . . the balance of power in \nEurope and the rights of the people," the abbe* \nwas saying. "It is only necessary for one power- \nful nation like Russia barbaric as she is said \nto be to place herself disinterestedly at the \nhead of an alliance having for its object the \nmai n tenance of the balance of power of Europe, \nand it would save the world!" \n\n"But how are you to get that balance?" Pierre \nwas beginning. \n\nAt that moment Anna Pdvlovna came up and, \nlooking severely at Pierre, asked the Italian \nhow he stood the Russian climate. The Italian's \nface instantly changed and assumed an offen- \nsively affected, sugary expression, evidently \nhabitual to him when conversing with women. \n\n\n\nBOOK \n\n"I am so enchanted by the brilliancy of the \nwit and culture of the society, more especially \nof the feminine society, in which I have had \nthe honor of being received, that I have not \nyet had time to think of the climate," said he. \n\nNot letting the abbe" and Pierre escape, Anna \nPdvlovna, the more conveniently to keep them \nunder observation, brought them into the \nlarger circle. \n\nCHAPTER IV \n\nJUST THEN another visitor entered the drawing \nroom: Prince Andrew Bolk6nski, the little \nprincess' husband. He was a very handsome \nyoung man, of medium height, with firm, clear- \ncut features. Everything about him, from his \nweary, bored expression to his quiet, measured \nstep, offered a most striking contrast to his \nlively little wife. It was evident that he not \nonly knew everyone in the drawing room, but \nhad found them to be so tiresome that it \nwearied him to look at or listen to them. And \namong all these faces that he found so tedious, \nnone seemed to bore him so much as that of \nhis pretty wife. He turned away from her with \na grimace that distorted his handsome face, \nkissed Anna Pdvlovna's hand, and screwing \nup his eyes scanned the whole company. \n\n"You are off to the war, Prince?" said Anna \nPdvlovna. \n\n"General Kutuzov," said Bolk6nski, speak- \ning French and stressing the last syllable of the \ngeneral's name like a Frenchman, "has been \npleased to take me as an aide-de-camp. . . ." \n\n"And Lise, your wile?" \n\n"She will go to the country." \n\n"Are you not ashamed to deprive us of your \ncharming wife?" \n\n"Andre," said his wife, addressing her hus- \nband in the same coquettish manner in which \nshe spoke to other men, "the vicomte has been \ntelling us such a tale about Mademoiselle \nGeorge and Buonaparte!" \n\nPrince Andrew screwed up his eyes and \nturned away. Pierre, who from the moment \nPrince Andrew entered the room had watched \nhim with glad, affectionate eyes, now came up \nand took his arm. Before he looked round \nPrince Andrew frowned again, expressing his \nannoyance with whoever was touching his arm, \nbut when he saw Pierre's beaming face he gave \nhim an unexpectedly kind and pleasant smile. \n\n"There now! ... So you, too, are in the great \nworld?" said he to Pierre. \n\n"I knew you would be here," replied Pierre. \n"I will come to supper with you. May I?" he \n\n\n\nONE 7 \n\nadded in a low voice so as not to disturb the \nvicomte who was continuing his story. \n\n"No, impossible 1" said Prince Andrew, \nlaughing and pressing Pierre's hand to show \nthat there was no need to ask the question. He \nwished to say something more, but at that mo- \nment Prince Vastti and his daughter got up to \ngo and the two young men rose to let them \npass. \n\n"You must excuse me, dear Vicomte," said \nPrince Vasili to the Frenchman, holding him \ndown by the sleeve in a friendly way to prevent \nhis rising. "This unfortunate fete at the ambas- \nsador's deprives me of a pleasure, and obliges \nme to interrupt you. I am very sorry to leave \nyour enchanting party," said he, turning to \nAnna Pdvlovna. \n\nHis daughter, Princess He*lene, passed be- \ntween the chairs, lightly holding up the folds \nof her dress, and the smile shone still more \nradiantly on her beautiful face. Pierre gazed \nat her with rapturous, almost frightened, eyes \nas she passed him. \n\n"Very lovely," said Prince Andrew. \n\n"Very," said Pierre. \n\nIn passing, Prince Vasili seized Pierre's hand \nand said to Anna Pdvlovna: "Educate this bear \nfor me! He has been staying with me a whole \nmonth and this is the first time I have seen \nhim in society. Nothing is so necessary for a \nyoung man as the society of clever women." \n\nANNA PAVLOVNA smiled and promised to take \nPierre in hand. She knew his father to be \na connection of Prince Vasili's. The elderly \nlady who had been sitting with the old aunt \nrose hurriedly and overtook Prince Vasfli in \nthe anteroom. All the affectation of interest \nshe had assumed had left her kindly and tear- \nworn face and it now expressed only anxiety \nand fear. \n\n"How about my son Borfs, Prince?" said \nshe, hurrying after him into the anteroom. "1 \ncan't remain any longer in Petersburg. Tell \nme what news I may take back to my poor \nboy." \n\nAlthough Prince Vasili listened reluctantly \nand not very politely to the elderly lady, even \nbetraying some impatience, she gave him an \ningratiating and appealing smile, and took his \nhand that he might not go away. \n\n"What would it cost you to say a word to the \nEmperor, and then he would be transferred to \nthe Guards at once?" said she. \n\n"Believe me, Princess, I am ready to do all \nI can," answered Prince Vasili, "but it is dif- \n\n\n\n8 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nficult for me to ask the Emperor. I should ad- \nvise you to appeal to Rumydntsev through \nPrince Golftsyn. That would be the best way." \n\nThe elderly lady was a Princess Drubet- \nskdya, belonging to one of the best families in \nRussia, but she was poor, and having long been \nout of society had lost her former influential \nconnections. She had now come to Petersburg \nto procure an appointment in the Guards for \nher only son. It was, in fact, solely to meet \nPrince Vasfli that she had obtained an invita- \ntion to Anna Pdvlovna's reception and had sat \nlistening to the vicomte's story. Prince Vasfli's \nwords frightened her, an embittered look \nclouded her once handsome face, but only for \na moment; then she smiled again and clutched \nPrince Vasili's arm more tightly. \n\n"Listen to me, Prince," said she. "I have \nnever yet asked you for anything and I never \nwill again, nor have I ever reminded you of \nmy father's friendship for you; but now I en- \ntreat you for God's sake to do this for my son \nand I shall always regard you as a benefac- \ntor," she added hurriedly. "No, don't be angry, \nbut promise! I have asked Golitsyn and he has \nrefused. Be the kindhearted man you always \nwere," she said, trying to smile though tears \nwere in her eyes. \n\n"Papa, we shall be late," said Princess \nHel&amp;ne, turning her beautiful head and look- \ning over her classically molded shoulder as \nshe stood waiting by the door. \n\nInfluence in society, however, is capital which \nhas to be economized if it is to last. Prince \nVasfli knew this, and having once realized \nthat if he asked on behalf of all who begged \nof him, he would soon be unable to ask for \nhimself, he became chary of using his influ- \nence. But in Princess Drubetskdya's case he \nfelt, after her second appeal, something like \nqualms of conscience. She had reminded him \nof what was quite true; he had been indebted to \nher father for the first steps in his career. More- \nover, he could see by her manners that she was \none of those womenmostly mothers who, \nhaving once made up their minds, will not rest \nuntil they have gained their end, and are pre- \npared if necessary to go on insisting day after \nday and hour after hour, and even to make \nscenes. This last consideration moved him. \n\n"My dear Anna Mikhdylovna," said he with \nhis usual familiarity and weariness of tone, "it \nis almost impossible for me to do what you ask; \nbut to prove my devotion to you and how I re- \nspect your father's memory, I will do the im- \npossibleyour son shall be transferred to the \n\n\n\nGuards. Here is my hand on it. Are you satis- \nfied?" * \n\n"My dear benefactor! This is what I ex- \npected from you I knew your kindness!" He \nturned to go. \n\n"Wait just a word! When he has been trans- \nferred to the Guards . . ." she faltered. "You \nare on good terms with Michael Ilari6novich \nKuttizov . . . recommend Boris to him as adju- \ntant! Then I shall be at rest, and then . . ." \n\nPrince Vasili smiled. \n\n"No, I won't promise that. You don't know \nhow Kutiizov is pestered since his appoint- \nment as Commander in Chief. He told me \nhimself that all the Moscow ladies have con- \nspired to give him all their sons as adjutants." \n\n"No, but do promise! I won't let you go! My \ndear benefactor . . ." \n\n"Papa," said his beautiful daughter in the \nsame tone as before, "we shall be late." \n\n"Well, au revoir! Good-by! You hear her?" \n\n"Then tomorrow you will speak to the Em- \nperor?" \n\n"Certainly; but about Kutiizov, I don't \npromise." \n\n"Do promise, do promise, Vasfli!" cried \nAnna Mikhdylovna as he went, with the smile \nof a coquettish girl, which at one time prob- \nably came naturally to her, but was now very \nill-suited to her careworn face. \n\nApparently she had forgotten her age and \nby force of habit employed all the old fem- \ninine arts. But as soon as the prince had gone \nher face resumed its former cold, artificial ex- \npression. She returned to the group where the \nvicomte was still talking, and again pretended \nto listen, while waiting till it would be time \nto leave. Her task was accomplished. \n\nCHAPTER V \n\n"AND what do you think of this latest com- \nedy, the coronation at Milan?" asked Anna \nPavlovna, "and of the comedy of the people \nof Genoa and Lucca laying their petitions \nbefore Monsieur Buonaparte, and Monsieur \nBuonaparte sitting on a throne and granting \nthe petitions of the nations? Adorable! It is \nenough to make one's head whirl! It is as if \nthe whole world had gone crazy." \n\nPrince Andrew looked Anna Pdvlovna \nstraight in the face with a sarcastic smile. \n\n" 'Dieu me la donne, gare a qui la touched J \nThey say he was very fine when he said that," \nhe remarked, repeating the words in Italian: \n\n1 God has given it to me, let him who touches it \nbeware) \n\n\n\nBOOK \n\n" 'Dio mi rha dato. Guai a chi la tocchi!' " \n\n"I hope this will prove the last cft*op that \nwill make the glass run over," Anna Pavlovna \ncontinued. "The sovereigns will not be able to \nendure this man who is a menace to every- \nthing." \n\n"The sovereigns? I do not speak of Russia," \nsaid the vicomte, polite but hopeless: "The \nsovereigns, madame . . . What have they done \nfor Louis XVII, for the Queen, or for Madame \nElizabeth? Nothing!" and he became more an- \nimated. "And believe me, they are reaping the \nreward of their betrayal of the Bourbon cause. \nThe sovereigns! Why, they are sending am- \nbassadors to compliment the usurper." \n\nAnd sighing disdainfully, he again changed \nhis position. \n\nPrince Hippolyte, who had been gazing at \nthe vicomte for some time through his lor- \ngnette, suddenly turned completely round to- \nward the little princess, and having asked for \na needle began tracing the Conde* coat of arms \non the table. He explained this to her with as \nmuch gravity as if she had asked him to do it. \n\n"Baton de gueules, engrele de gueules d' \nazurmaison Condd," said he. \n\nThe princess listened, smiling. \n\n"If Buonaparte remains on the throne of \nFrance a year longer," the vicomte continued, \nwith the air of a man who, in a matter with \nwhich he is better acquainted than anyone else, \ndoes not listen to others but follows the cur- \nrent of his own thoughts, "things will have \ngone too far. By intrigues, violence, exile, and \nexecutions,French society I mean good French \nsociety will have been forever destroyed, and \nthen . . ." \n\nHe shrugged his shoulders and spread out \nhis hands. JPierre wished to make a remark, for \nthe conversation interested him, but Anna \nPdvlovna, who had him under observation, in- \nterrupted: \n\n"The Emperor Alexander," said she, with \nthe melancholy which always accompanied any \nreference of hers to the Imperial family, "has \ndeclared that he will leave it to the French \npeople themselves to choose their own form \nof government; and I believe that once free \nfrom the usurper, the whole nation will cer- \ntainly throw itself into the arms of its rightful \nking," she concluded, trying to be amiable to \nthe royalist emigrant. \n\n. "That is doubtful," said Prince Andrew. \n"Monsieur le Vicomte quite rightly supposes \nthat matters have already gone too far. I think \nit will be difficult to return to the old regime." \n\n\n\nONE 9 \n\n"From what I have heard," said Pierre, \nblushing and breaking into the conversation, \n"almost all the aristocracy has already gone \nover to Bonaparte's side." \n\n"It is the Buonapartists who say that," re- \nplied the vicomte without looking at Pierre. \n"At the present time it is difficult to know the \nreal state of French public opinion." \n\n"Bonaparte has said so," remarked Prince \nAndrew with a sarcastic smile. \n\nIt was evident that he did not like the vi- \ncomte and was aiming his remarks at him, \nthough without looking at him. \n\n" 'I showed them the path to glory, but they \ndid not follow it,' " Prince Andrew continued \nafter a short silence, again quoting Napoleon's \nwords. " 'I opened my antechambers and they \ncrowded in.' I do not know how far he was \njustified in saying so." \n\n"Not in the least," replied the vicomte. "Aft- \ner the murder of the due even the most par- \ntial ceased to regard him as a hero. If to some \npeople," he went on, turning to Anna Pav- \nlovna, "he ever was a hero, after the murder \nof the due there was one martyr more in heav- \nen and one hero less on earth." \n\nBefore Anna Pdvlovna and the others had \ntime to smile their appreciation of the vi- \ncomte's epigram, Pierre again broke into the \nconversation, and though Anna Pdvlovna felt \nsure he would say something inappropriate, \nshe was unable to stop him. \n\n"The execution of the Due d'Enghien," de- \nclared Monsieur Pierre, "was a political neces- \nsity, and it seems to me that Napoleon showed \ngreatness of soul by not fearing to take on him- \nself the whole responsibility of that deed." \n\n"Dieu! Mon Dieu!" muttered Anna Pav- \nlovna in a terrified whisper. \n\n"What, Monsieur Pierre . . . Do you con- \nsider that assassination shows greatness of \nsoul?" said the little princess, smiling and \ndrawing her work nearer to her. \n\n"Oh! Oh!" exclaimed several voices. \n\n"Capital!" said Prince Hippolyte in Eng- \nlish, and began slapping his knee with the \npalm of his hand. \n\nThe vicomte merely shrugged his shoulders. \nPierre looked solemnly at his audience over \nhis spectacles and continued. \n\n"I say so," he continued desperately, "be- \ncause the Bourbons fled from the Revolution \nleaving the people to anarchy, and Napoleon \nalone understood the Revolution and quelled \nit, and so for the general good, he could not \nstop short for the sake of one man's life." \n\n\n\n1O \n\n"Won't you come over to the other table?" \nsuggested Anna Pvlovna, \n\nBut Pierre continued his speech without \nheeding her. \n\n"No," cried he, becoming more and more \neager, "Napoleon is great because he rose su- \nperior to the Revolution, suppressed its a- \nbuses, preserved all that was good in itequal- \nity of citizenship and freedom of speech and \nof the press and only for that reason did he \nobtain power." \n\n"Yes, if having obtained power, without a- \nvailing himself of it to commit murder he had \nrestored it to the rightful king, I should have \ncalled him a great man," remarked the vi- \ncomte. \n\n"He could not do that. The people only \ngave him power that he might rid them of the \nBourbons and because they saw that he was a \ngreat man. The Revolution was a grand thing!" \ncontinued Monsieur Pierre, betraying by this \ndesperate and provocative proposition his ex- \ntreme youth and his wish to express all that \nwas in his mind. \n\n"What? Revolution and regicide a grand \nthing? . . . Well, after that . . . But won't you \ncome to this other table?" repeated Anna Pdv- \nlovna. \n\n"Rousseau's Contrat social," said the vi- \ncomte with a tolerant smile. \n\n"I am not speaking of regicide, I am speak- \ning about ideas." \n\n"Yes: ideas of robbery, murder, and regi- \ncide," again interjected an ironical voice. \n\n"Those were extremes, no doubt, but they \nare not what is most important. What is im- \nportant are the rights of man, emancipation \nfrom prejudices, and equality of citizenship, \nand all these ideas Napoleon has retained in \nfull force." \n\n"Liberty and equality," said the vicomte \ncontemptuously, as if at last deciding seriously \nto prove to this youth how foolish his words \nwere, "high-sounding words which have long \nbeen discredited. Who does not love liberty \nand equality? Even our Saviour preached lib- \nerty and equality. Have people since the Rev- \nolution become happier? On the contrary. We \nwanted liberty, but Buonaparte has destroyed \nit." \n\nPrince Andrew kept looking with an a- \nmused smile from Pierre to the vicomte and \nfrom the vicomte to their hostess. In the first \nmoment of Pierre's outburst Anna Pdvlovna, \ndespite her social experience, was horror- \nstruck. But when she saw that Pierre's sacri- \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nlegious words had not exasperated the vi- \ncomte, ahd had convinced herself that it was \nimpossible to stop him, she rallied her forces \nand joined the vicomte in a vigorous attack on \nthe orator. \n\n"But, my dear Monsieur Pierre," said she, \n"how do you explain the fact of a great man \nexecuting a due or even an ordinary man \nwho is innocent and untried?" \n\n"I should like," said the vicomte, "to ask \nhow monsieur explains the iSthBrumaire; was \nnot that an imposture? It was a swindle, and \nnot at all like the conduct of a great man!" \n\n"And the prisoners he killed in Africa?That \nwas horrible!" said the little princess, shrug- \nging her shoulders. \n\n"He's a low fellow, say what you will," re- \nmarked Prince Hippolyte. \n\nPierre, not knowing whom to answer, looked \nat them all and smiled. His smile was unlike \nthe half-smile of other people. When he smiled, \nhis grave, even rather gloomy, look was instan- \ntaneously replaced by another a childlike, \nkindly, even rather silly look, which seemed to \nask forgiveness. \n\nThe vicomte who was meeting him for the \nfirst time saw clearly that this young Jacobin \nwas not so terrible as his words suggested. All \nwere silent. \n\n"How do you expect him to answer you all \nat once?" said Prince Andrew. "Besides, in the \nactions of a statesman one has to distinguish \nbetween his acts as a private person, as a gen- \neral, and as an emperor. So it seems to me." \n\n"Yes, yes, of course!" Pierre chimed in, \npleased at the arrival of this reinforcement. \n\n"One must admit," continued Prince An- \ndrew, "that Napoleon as a man was great on \nthe bridge of Arcola, and in the hospital at \nJaffa where he gave his hand to the plague- \nstricken; but . . . but there are other acts which \nit is difficult to justify." \n\nPrince Andrew, who had evidently wished \nto tone down the awkwardness of Pierre's re- \nmarks, rose and made a sign to his wife that it \nwas time to go. \n\nSuddenly Prince Hippolyte started up mak- \ning signs to everyone to attend, and asking \nthem all to be seated began: \n\n"I was told a charming Moscow story today \nand must treat you to it. Excuse me, Vicomte \nI must tell it in Russian or the point will be \nlost. . . ." And Prince Hippolyte began to tell \nhis story in sucli Russian as a Frenchman \nwould speak after spending about a year in \n\n\n\nBOOK ONE \n\n\n\nRussia. Everyone waited, so emphatically and \neagerly did he demand their attention to his \nstory. \n\n"There is in Moscow a lady, une dame, and \nshe is very stingy. She must have two footmen \nbehind her carriage, and very big ones. That \nwas her taste. And she had a lady's maid, also \nbig. She said . . ." \n\nHere Prince Hippolyte paused, evidently \ncollecting his ideas with difficulty. \n\n"She said ... Oh yes! She said, 'Girl,' to the \nmaid, 'put on a livery, get up behind the car- \nriage, and come with me while I make some \ncalls/ " \n\nHere Prince Hippolyte spluttered andburst \nout laughing long before his audience, which \nproduced an effect unfavorable to the narra- \ntor. Several persons, among them the elderly \nlady and Anna Pavlovna, did however smile. \n\n"She went. Suddenly there was a great wind. \nThe girl lost her hat and her long hair came \ndown. . . ." Here he could contain himself no \nlonger and went on, between gasps of laugh- \nter: "And the whole world knew. . . ." \n\nAnd so the anecdote ended. Though it was \nunintelligible why he had told it, or why it \nhad to be told in Russian, still Anna Pdvlovna \nand the others appreciated Prince Hippolyte's \nsocial tact in so agreeably ending Pierre's un- \npleasant and unamiable outburst. After the \nanecdote the conversation broke up into in- \nsignificant small talk about the last and next \nballs, about theatricals, and who would meet \nwhom, and when and where. \n\nCHAPTER VI \n\nHAVING THANKED Anna Pavlovna for her \n'charming soiree, the guests began to take their \nleave. \n\nPierre was ungainly. Stout, about the aver- \nage height, broad, with huge red hands; he did \nnot know, as the saying is, how to enter a draw- \ning room and still less how to leave one; that \nis, how to say something particularly agreeable \nbefore going away. Besides this he was absent- \nminded. When he rose to go, he took up in- \nstead of his own, the general's three-cornered \nhat, and held it, pulling at the plume, till the \ngeneral asked him to restore it. All his absent- \nmindedness and inability to enter a room and \nconverse in it was, however, redeemed by his \nkindly, simple, and modest expression. Anna \nPdvlovna turned toward him and, with a \nChristian mildness that expressed forgiveness \nof his indiscretion, nodded and said: "I hope to \nsee you again, but I also hope you will change \n\n\n\nyour opinions, my dear Monsieur Pierre." \n\nWhen she said this, he did not reply and \nonly bowed, but again everybody saw his smile, \nwhich said nothing, unless perhaps, "Opinions \nare opinions, but you see what a capital, good- \nnatured fellow I am." And everyone, includ- \ning Anna Pavlovna, felt this. \n\nPrince Andrew had gone out into the hall, \nand, turning his shoulders to the footman who \nwas helping him on with his cloak, listened in- \ndifferently to his wife's chatter with Prince \nHippolyte who had also come into the hall. \nPrince Hippolyte stood close to the pretty, \npregnant princess, and stared fixedly at hei \nthrough his eyeglass. \n\n"Go in, Annette, or you will catch cold," \nsaid the little princess, taking leave of Anna \nPavlovna. "It is settled," she added in a low \nvoice. \n\nAnna Pavlovna had already managed to \nspeak to Lise about the match she contem- \nplated between Anatole and the little princess' \nsister-in-law. \n\n"I rely on you, my dear," said Anna Pdv- \nlovna, also in a low tone. "Write to her and \nlet me know how her father looks at the mat- \nter. An revoir!"znd she left the hall. \n\nPrince Hippolyte approached the little prin- \ncess and, bending his face close to her, began \nto whisper something. \n\nTwo footmen, the princess' and his own, \nstood holding a shawl and a cloak, waiting for \nthe conversation to finish. They listened to \nthe French sentences which to them were \nmeaningless, with an air of understanding but \nnot wishing to appear to do so. The princess \nas usual spoke smilingly and listened with a \nlaugh. \n\n"I am very glad I did not go to the ambas- \nsador's," said Prince Hippolyte "so dull. \nIt has been a delightful evening, has it not? \nDelightful!" \n\n"They say die ball will be very good," re- \nplied the princess, drawing up her downy lit- \ntle lip. "All the pretty women in society will \nbe there." \n\n"Not all, for you will not be there; not all," \nsaid Prince Hippolyte smiling joyfully; and \nsnatching the shawl from the footman, whom \nhe even pushed aside, he began wrapping it \nround the princess. Either from awkwardness \nor intentionally (no one could have said \nwhich) after the shawl had been adjusted he \nkept his arm around her for a long time, as \nthough embracing her. \n\nStill smiling, she gracefully moved away, \n\n\n\nIS \n\nturning and glancing at her husband. Prince \nAndrew's eyes were closed, so weary and sleepy \ndid he seem. \n\n"Are you ready?" he asked his wife, look- \ning past her. \n\nPrince Hippolyte hurriedly put on his cloak, \nwhich in the latest fashion reached to his very \nheels, and, stumbling in it, ran out into the \nporch following the princess, whom a footman \nwas helping into the carriage. \n\n"Princesse, au revoir" cried he, stumbling \nwith his tongue as well as with his feet. \n\nThe princess, picking up her dress, was tak- \ning her seat in the dark carriage, her husband \nwas adjusting his saber; Prince Hippolyte, un- \nder pretense of helping, was in everyone's \nway. \n\n"Allow me, sir/' said Prince Andrew in Rus- \nsian in a cold, disagreeable tone to Prince \nHippolyte who was blocking his path. \n\n"I am expecting you, Pierre," said the same \nvoice, but gently and affectionately. \n\nThe postilion started, the carriage wheels \nrattled. Prince Hippolyte laughed spasmod- \nically as he stood in the porch waiting for the \nvicomte whom he had promised to take home. \n\n"Well, mon cher" said the vicomte, having \nseated himself beside Hippolyte in the car- \nriage, "your little princess is very nice, very \nnice indeed, quite French," and he kissed the \ntips of his fingers. Hippolyte burst out laugh- \ning. \n\n"Do you know, you are a terrible chap for \nall your innocent airs," continued the vicomte. \n"I pity the poor husband, that little officer who \ngives himself the airs of a monarch." \n\nHippolyte spluttered again, and amid his \nlaughter said, "And you were saying that the \nRussian ladies are not equal to the French? \nOne has to know how to deal with them." \n\nPierre reaching the house first went into \nPrince Andrew's study like one quite at home, \nand from habit immediately lay down on the \nsofa, took from the shelf the first book that \ncame to his hand (it was Caesar's Commen- \ntaries), and resting on his elbow, began read- \ning it in the middle. \n\n"What have you done to Mile Sch^rer? She \nwill be quite ill now," said Prince Andrew, as \nhe entered the study, rubbing his small white \nhands. \n\nPierre turned his whole body, making the \nsofa creak. He lifted his eager face to Prince \nAndrew, smiled, and waved his hand. \n\n"That abbl is very interesting but he does \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nnot see the thing in the right light. ... In my \nopinion perpetual peace is possible but I do \nnot know how to express it ... not by a bal- \nance of political power. . . ." \n\nIt was evident that Prince Andrew was not \ninterested in such abstract conversation. \n\n"One can't everywhere say all one thinks, \nmon cher. Well, have you at last decided on \nanything? Are you going to be a guardsman or \na diplomatist?" asked Prince Andrew after a \nmomentary silence. \n\nPierre sat up on the sofa, with his legs \ntucked under him. \n\n"Really, I don't yet know. I don't like either \nthe one or the other." \n\n"But you must decide on somethingl Your \nfather expects it." \n\nPierre at the age of ten had been sent a- \nbroad with an abb as tutor, and had remained \naway till he was twenty. When he returned to \nMoscow his father dismissed the abbe* and said \nto the young man, "Now go to Petersburg, \nlook round, and choose your profession. I will \nagree to anything. Here is a letter to Prince \nVasili, and here is money. Write to me all \nabout it, and I will help you in everything." \nPierre had already been choosing a career for \nthree months, and had not decided on any- \nthing. It was about this choice that Prince \nAndrew was speaking. Pierre rubbed his fore- \nhead. \n\n"But he must be a Freemason," said he, re- \nferring to the abb whom he had met that \nevening. ( \n\n"That is all nonsense." Prince Andrew \nagain interrupted him, "let us talk business. \nHave you been to the Horse Guards?" \n\n"No, I have not; but this is what I have \nbeen thinking and wanted to tell you. There \nis a war now against Napoleon. If it were a \nwar for freedom I could understand it and \nshould be the first to enter the army; but to \nhelp England and Austria against the greatest \nman in the world is not right." \n\nPrince Andrew only shrugged his shoulders \nat Pierre's childish words. He put on the air \nof one who finds it impossible to reply to \nsuch nonsense, but it would in fact have been \ndifficult to give any other answer than the one \nPrince Andrew gave to this naive question. \n\n"If no one fought except on his own con- \nviction, there would be no wars," he said. \n\n"And that would be splendid," said Pierre. \n\nPrince Andrew smiled ironically. \n\n"Very likely it would be splendid, but it will \nnever come about. . . ." \n\n\n\nBOOK ONE \n\n\n\n"Well, why are you going to the war?" asked \nPierre. t \n\n"What for? I don't know. I must. Besides \nthat I am going . . ." He paused. "I am going \nbecause the life I am leading here does not \nsuit mel" \n\nCHAPTER VII \n\nTHE RUSTLE of a woman's dress was heard in \nthe next room. Prince Andrew shook himself \nas if waking up, and his face assumed the look \nit had had in Anna Pdvlovna's drawing room. \nPierre removed his feet from the sofa. The \nprincess came in. She had changed her gown \nfor a house dress as fresh and elegant as the \nother. Prince Andrew rose and politely placed \na chair for her. \n\n"How is it," she began, as usual in French, \nsettling down briskly and fussily in the easy \nchair, "how is it Annette never got married? \nHow stupid you men all are not to have mar- \nried her! Excuse me for saying so, but you \nhave no sense about women. What an argu- \nmentative fellow you are, Monsieur Pierre!" \n\n"And I am still arguing with your husband. \nI can't understand why he wants to go to the \nwar," replied Pierre, addressing the princess \nwith none of the embarrassment so commonly \nshown by young men in their intercourse with \nyoung women. \n\nThe princess started. Evidently Pierre's \nwords touched her to the quick. \n\n"Ah, that is just what I tell himl" said she. \n"I don't understand it; I don't in the least un- \nderstand why men can't live without wars. \nHow is it that we women don't want anything \nof the kind, don't need it? Now you shall \njudge between us. I always tell him: Here he \nis Uncle's aide-de-camp, a most brilliant posi- \ntion. He is so well known, so much appreciated \nby everyone. The other day at the Aprksins' I \nheard a lady asking, 'Is that the famous Prince \nAndrew?' I did indeed." She laughed. "He is \nso well received everywhere. He might easily \nbecome aide-de-camp to the Emperor. You \nknow the Emperor spoke to him most gra- \nciously. Annette and I were speaking of how to \narrange it. What do you think?" \n\nPierre looked at his friend and, noticing \nthat he did not like the conversation, gave no \nreply. \n\n"When are you starting?" he asked. \n\n"Oh, don't speak of his going, don't! I won't \nhear it spoken of," said the princess in the \nsame petulantly playful tone in which she had \nspoken to Hippolyte in the drawing room and \n\n\n\nwhich was so plainly ill-suited to the family \ncircle of which Pierre was almost a member. \n"Today when I remembered that all these de- \nlightful associations must be broken off ... \nand then you know, Andr . . ." (she looked \nsignificantly at her husband) "I'm afraid, I'm \nafraid!" she whispered, and a shudder ran \ndown her back. \n\nHer husband looked at her as if surprised to \nnotice that someone besides Pierre and him- \nself was in the room, and addressed her in a \ntone of frigid politeness. \n\n"What is it you are afraid of, Lise? I don't \nunderstand," said he. \n\n"There, what egotists men all are: all, all \negotists! Just for a whim of his own, goodness \nonly knows why, he leaves me and locks me up \nalone in the country." \n\n"With my father and sister, remember," said \nPrince Andrew gently. \n\n"Alone all the same, without my friends. \n. . . And he expects me not to be afraid." \n\nHer tone was now querulous and her lip \ndrawn up, giving her not a joyful, but an ani- \nmal, squirrel-like expression. She paused as if \nshe felt it indecorous to speak of her preg- \nnancy before Pierre, though the gist of the \nmatter lay in that. \n\n"I still can't understand what you are afraid \nof," said Prince Andrew slowly, not taking his \neyes off his wife. \n\nThe princess blushed, and raised her arms \nwith a gesture of despair. \n\n"No, Andrew, I must say you have changed. \nOh, how you have . . ." \n\n"Your doctor tells you to go to bed earlier," \nsaid Prince Andrew. "You had better go." \n\nThe princess said nothing, but suddenly her \nshort downy lip quivered. Prince Andrew rose, \nshrugged his shoulders, and walked about the \nroom. \n\nPierre looked over his spectacles with nai've \nsurprise, now at him and now at her, moved \nas if about to rise too, but changed his mind. \n\n"Why should I mind Monsieur Pierre being \nhere?" exclaimed the little princess suddenly, \nher pretty face all at once distorted by a tear- \nful grimace. "I have long wanted to ask you, \nAndrew, why you have changed so to me? \nWhat have I done to you? You are going to \nthe war and have no pity for me. Why is it?" \n\n"Lise!" was all Prince Andrew said. But that \none word expressed an entreaty, a threat, and \nabove all conviction that she would herself re- \ngret her words. But she went on hurriedly: \n\n"You treat me like an invalid or a child. I \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nsee it all! Did you behave like that six months \nago?" \n\n"Lise, I beg you to desist," said Prince An- \ndrew still more emphatically. \n\nPierre, who had been growing more and \nmore agitated as he listened to all this, rose \nand approached the princess. He seemed un- \nable to bear the sight of tears and was ready to \ncry himself. \n\n"Calm yourself, Princess! It seems so to you \nbecause ... I assure you I myself have experi- \nenced . . . and so ... because . . . No, excuse \nme! An outsider is out of place here . . . No, \ndon't distress yourself . . . Good-by!" \n\nPrince Andrew caught him by the hand. \n\n"No, wait, Pierre! The princess is too kind \nto wish to deprive me of the pleasure of spend- \ning the evening with you." \n\n"No, he thinks only of himself," muttered the \nprincess without restraining her angry tears. \n\n"Lise!" said Prince Andrew dryly, raising \nhis voice to the pitch which indicates that pa- \ntience is exhausted. \n\nSuddenly the angry, squirrel-like expression \nof the princess' pretty face changed into a win- \nning and piteous look of fear. Her beautiful \neyes glanced askance at her husband's -face, \nand her own assumed the timid, deprecating \nexpression of a dog when it rapidly but feebly \nwags its drooping tail. \n\n"M on Dieu, rnon Dieu!" she muttered, and \nlifting her dress with one hand she went up to \nher husband and kissed him on the forehead. \n\n"Good night, Lise," said he, rising and cour- \nteously kissing her hand as he would have done \nto a stranger. \n\nCHAPTER VIII \n\nTHE FRIENDS were silent. Neither cared to be- \ngin talking. Pierre continually glanced at \nPrince Andrew; Prince Andrew rubbed his \nforehead with his small hand. \n\n"Let us go and have supper," he said with a \nsigh, going to the door. \n\nThey entered the elegant, newly decorated, \nand luxurious dining room. Everything from \nthe table napkins to the silver, china, and glass \nbore that imprint of newness found in the \nhouseholds of the newly married. Halfway \nthrough supper Prince Andrew leaned his el- \nbows on the table and, with a look of nervous \nagitation such as Pierre had never before seen \non his face, began to talk as one who has long \nhad something on his mind and suddenly de- \ntermines to speak out. \n\n"Never, never marry, my dear fellow! That's \n\n\n\nmy advice: never marry till you can say to \nyoursel f that you have done all you are capa- \nble of, and until you have ceased to love the \nwoman of your choice and have seen her plain- \nly as she is, or else you will make a cruel and \nirrevocable mistake. Marry when you are old \nand good for nothing or all that is good and \nnoble in you will be lost. It will all be wasted \non trifles. Yes! Yes! Yes! Don't look at me with \nsuch surprise. If you marry expecting anything \nfrom yourself in the future, you will feel at \nevery step that for you all is ended, all is closed \nexcept the drawing room, where you will be \nranged side by side with a court lackey and an \nidiot! . . . But what's the good? . . ." and he \nwaved his arm. \n\nPierre took off his spectacles, which made \nhis face seem different and the good-natured \nexpression still more apparent, and gazed at \nhis friend in amazement. \n\n"My wife," continued Prince Andrew, "is \nan excellent woman, one of those rare women \nwith whom a man's honor is safe; but, O God, \nwhat would I not give now to be unmarried! \nYou are the first and only one to whom I men- \ntion this, because I like you." \n\nAs he said this Prince Andrew was less than \never like that Bolk6nski who had lolled in \nAnna Pavlovna's easy chairs and with half- \nclosed eyes had uttered French phrases be- \ntween his teeth. Every muscle of his thin face \nwas now quivering with nervous excitement; \nhis eyes, in which the fire of life had seemed \nextinguished, now flashed with brilliant light. \nIt was evident that the more lifeless he seemed \nat ordinary times, the more impassioned he be- \ncame in these moments of almost morbid irri- \ntation. \n\n"You don't understand why I say this," he \ncontinued, "but it is the whole story of life. \nYou talk of Bonaparte and his career," said \nhe (though Pierre had not mentioned Bona- \nparte), "but Bonaparte when he worked went \nstep by step toward his goal. He was free, he \nhad nothing but his aim to consider, and he \nreached it. But tie yourself up with a woman \nand, like a chained convict, you lose all free- \ndom! And all you have of hope and strength \nmerely weighs you down and torments you \nwith regret. Drawing rooms, gossip, balls, van- \nity, and triviality these are the enchanted \ncircle I cannot escape from. I am now going \nto the war, the greatest war there ever was, \nand I know nothing and am fit for nothing. \nI am very amiable and have a caustic wit," \ncontinued Prince Andrew, "and at Anna Pdv- \n\n\n\nBOOK ONE \n\n\n\nlovna's they listen to me. And that stupid set \nwithout whom my wife cannot exist, an4 those \nwomen ... If you only knew what those society \nwomen are, and women in general I My father \nis right. Selfish, vain, stupid, trivial in every- \nthingthat's what women are when you see \nthem in their true colors! When you meet them \nin society it seems as if there were something \nin them, but there's nothing, nothing, noth- \ning! No, don't marry, my dear fellow; don't \nmarry!" concluded Prince Andrew. \n\n"It seems funny to me," said Pierre, "that \nyou, you should consider yourself incapable \nand your life a spoiled life. You have every- \nthing before you, everything. And you . . ." \n\nHe did not finish his sentence, but his tone \nshowed how highly he thought of his friend \nand how much he expected of him in the fu- \nture. \n\n"How can he talk like that?" thought Pierre. \nHe considered his friend a model of perfec- \ntion because Prince Andrew possessed in the \nhighest degree just the very qualities Pierre \nlacked, and which might be best described as \nstrength of will. Pierre was always astonished \nat Prince Andrew's calm manner of treating \neverybody, his extraordinary memory, his ex- \ntensive reading (he had read everything, knew \neverything, and had an opinion about every- \nthing), but above all at his capacity for work \nand study. And if Pierre was often struck by \nAndrew's lack of capacity for philosophical \nmeditation (to which he himself was particu- \nlarly addicted), he regarded even this not as a \ndefect but as a sign of strength. \n\nEven in the best, most friendly and sim- \nplest relations of life, praise and commenda- \ntion are essential, just as grease is necessary to \nwheels that they may run smoothly. \n\n"My part is played out," said Prince An- \ndrew. "What's the use of talking about me? \nLet us talk about you," he added after a si- \nlence, smiling at his reassuring thoughts. \n\nThat smile was immediately reflected on \nPierre's face. \n\n"But what is there to say about me?" said \nPierre, his face relaxing into a careless, merry \nsmile. "What am I? An illegitimate son!" He \nsuddenly blushed crimson, and it was plain that \nhe had made a great effort to say this. "With- \nout a name and without means . . . And it \nreally . , ." But he did not say what "it really" \nwas. "For the present I am free and am all \nright. Only I haven't the least idea what I am \nto do; I wanted to consult you seriously." \n\nPrince Andrew looked kindly at him, yet \n\n\n\nhis glance friendly and affectionate as it was \nexpressed a sense of his own superiority. \n\n"I am fond of you, especially as you are the \none live man among our whole set. Yes, you're \nall right! Choose what you will; it's all the \nsame. You'll be all right anywhere. But look \nhere: give up visiting those Kurdgins and lead- \ning that sort of life. It suits you so badly all \nthis debauchery, dissipation, and the rest of \nit!" \n\n"What would you have, my dear fellow?" \nanswered Pierre, shrugging his shoulders. \n"Women, my dear fellow; women!" \n\n"I don't understand it," replied Prince An- \ndrew. "Women who are comme il faut, that's \na different matter; but the Kuragins' set of \nwomen, 'women and wine,' I -don't under- \nstand!" \n\nPierre was staying at Prince Vasili Kurdgin's \nand sharing the dissipated life of his son Ana- \ntole, the son whom they were planning to re- \nform by marrying him to Prince Andrew's \nsister. \n\n"Do you know?" said Pierre, as if suddenly \nstruck by a happy thought, "seriously, I have \nlong been thinking of it. ... Leading such a \nlife I can't decide or think properly about any- \nthing. One's head aches, and one spends all \none's money. He asked me for tonight, but \n1 won't go." \n\n"You give me your word of honor not to \ngo?" \n\n"On my honor!" \n\nCHAPTER IX \n\n1 r WAS past one o'clock when Pierre left his \nfriend. It was a cloudless, northern, summer \nnight. Pierre took an open cab intending to \ndrive straight home. But the nearer he drew to \nthe house the more he felt the impossibility of \ngoing to sleep on such a night. It was light \nenough to see a long way in the deserted street \nand it seemed more like morning or evening \nthan night. On the way Pierre remembered \nthat Anatole Kuragin was expecting the usual \nset for cards that evening, after which there \nwas generally a drinking bout, finishing with \nvisits of a kind Pierre was very fond of. \n\n"I should like to go to Kuragin's," thought \nhe. \n\nBut he immediately recalled his promise to \nPrince Andrew not to go there. Then, as hap- \npens to people of weak character, he desired \nso passionately once more to enjoy that dissi- \npation he was so accustomed to that he de- \ncided to go. The thought immediately occurred \n\n\n\ni6 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nto him that his promise to Prince Andrew was \nof no account, because before he gave it he \nhad already promised Prince Anatole to come \nto his gathering; "besides," thought he, "all \nsuch 'words of honor' are conventional things \nwith no definite meaning, especially if one \nconsiders that by tomorrow one may be dead, \nor something so extraordinary may happen to \none that honor and dishonor will be all the \nsamel" Pierre often indulged in reflections \nof this sort, nullifying all his decisions and in- \ntentions. He went to Kurdgin's. \n\nReaching the large house near the Horse \nGuards' barracks, in which Anatole lived, \nPierre entered the lighted porch, ascended \nthe stairs, and went in at the open door. There \nwas no one in the anteroom; empty bottles, \ncloaks, and overshoes were lying about; there \nwas a smell of alcohol, and sounds of voices \nand shouting in the distance. \n\nCards and supper were over, but the visitors \nhad not yet dispersed. Pierre threw off his \ncloak and entered the first room, in which were \nthe remains of supper. A footman, thinking \nno one saw him, was drinking on the sly what \nwas left in the glasses. From the third room \ncame sounds of laughter, the shouting of famil- \niar voices, the growling of a bear, and general \ncommotion. Some eight or nine young men \nwere crowding anxiously round an open win- \ndow. Three others were romping with a young \nbear, one pulling him by the chain and trying \nto set him at the others. \n\n"I bet a hundred on Stevens!" shouted one. \n\n"Mind, no holding on I" cried another. \n\n"I bet on Dolokhovl" cried a third. "Kura- \ngin, you part our hands." \n\n"There, leave Bruin alone; here's a bet on." \n\n"At one draught, or he loses!" shouted a \nfourth. \n\n"Jacob, bring a bottle!" shouted the host, \na tall, handsome fellow who stood in the midst \nof the group, without a coat, and with his fine \nlinen shirt unfastened in front. "Wait a bit, \nyou fellows. . . . Here is Pdtya! Good man!" \ncried he, addressing Pierre. \n\nAnother voice, from a man of medium \nheight with clear blue eyes, particularly strik- \ning among all these drunken voices by its sober \nring, criedfrom thewindow: "Comehere; part \nthe bets!" This was D61okhov, an officer of the \nSemenov regiment, a notorious gambler and \nduelist, who was living with Anatole. Pierre \nsmiled, looking about him merrily. \n\n"I don't understand. What's it all about?" \n\n"Wait a bit, he is not drunk yet! A bottle \n\n\n\nhere," said Anatole, and taking a glass from \nthe ta^le he went up to Pierre. \n\n"First of all you must drink!" \n\nPierre drank one glass after another, look- \ning from under his brows at the tipsy guests \nwho were again crowding round the window, \nand listening to their chatter. Anatole kept on \nrefilling Pierre's glass while explaining that \nD61okhov was betting with Stevens, an Eng- \nlish naval officer, that he would drink a bottle \nof rum sitting on the outer ledge of the third- \nfloor window with his legs hanging out. \n\n"Go on, you must drink it all," said Anatole, \ngiving Pierre the last glass, "or I won't let you \ngo!" \n\n"No, I won't," said Pierre, pushing Anatole \naside, and he went up to the window. \n\nD61okhov was holding the Englishman's \nhand and clearly and distinctly repeating the \nterms of the bet, addressing himself particu- \nlarly to Anatole and Pierre. \n\nD61okhov was of medium height, with curly \nhair and light-blue eyes. He was about twenty- \nfive. Like all infantry officers he wore no mus- \ntache, so that his mouth, the most striking \nfeature of his face, was clearly seen. The lines \nof that mouth were remarkably finely curved. \nThe middle of the upper lip formed a sharp \nwedge and closed firmly on the firm lower one, \nand something like two distinct smiles played \ncontinually round the two corners of the \nmouth; this, together with the resolute, inso- \nlent intelligence of his eyes, produced an effect \nwhich made it impossible not to notice his \nface. D61okhov was a man of small means and \nno connections. Yet, though Anatole spent \ntens of thousands of rubles, D61okhov lived \nwith him and had placed himself on such a \nfooting that all who knew them, including Ana- \ntole himself , respected him more than they did \nAnatole. D61okhov could play all games and \nnearly always won. However much he drank, \nhe never lost his clearheadedness. Both Kurdgin \nand D61okhov were at that time notorious \namong the rakes and scapegraces of Petersburg. \n\nThe bottle of rum was brought. The window \nframe which prevented anyone from sitting \non the outer sill was being forced out by two \nfootmen, who were evidently flurried and in- \ntimidated by the directions and shouts of the \ngentlemen around. \n\nAnatole with his swaggering air strode up to \nthe window. He wanted to smash something. \nPushing away the footmen he tugged at the \nframe, but could not move it. He smashed a \npane. \n\n\n\nBOOK ONE \n\n\n\n"You have a try, Hercules/' said he, Burning \nto Pierre. \n\nPierre seized the crossbeam, tugged, and \nwrenched the oak frame out with a crash. \n\n"Take it right out, or they'll think I'm hold- \ning on," said D61okhov. \n\n"Is the Englishman bragging? . . . Eh? Is it \nall right?" said Anatole. \n\n"First-rate," said Pierre, looking at D61ok- \nhov, who with a bottle of rum in his hand was \napproaching the window, from which the light \nof the sky, the dawn merging with the after- \nglow of sunset, was visible. \n\nD61okhov,the bottle of rum still in his hand, \njumped onto the window sill. "Listen!" cried \nhe, standing there and addressing those in the \nroom. All were silent. \n\n"I bet fifty imperials" he spoke French that \nthe Englishman might understand him, but he \ndid not speak it very well "I bet fifty im- \nperials ... or do you wish to make it a hun- \ndred?" added he, addressing the Englishman. \n\n"No, fifty," replied the latter. \n\n"All right. Fifty imperials . . . that I will \ndrink a whole bottle of rum without taking \nit from my mouth, sitting outside the window \non this spot" (he stooped and pointed to the \nsloping ledge outside the window) "and with- \nout holding on to anything. Is that right?" \n\n"Quite right," said the Englishman. \n\nAnatole turned to the Englishman and tak- \ning him by one of the buttons of his coat and \nlooking down at him the Englishman was \nshort began repeating the terms of the wager \nto him in English. \n\n"Wait!" cried Dolokhov, hammering with \nthe bottle on the window sill to attract atten- \ntion. "Wait a bit, Kuragin. Listen! If anyone \nelse does the same, I will pay him a hundred \nimperials. Do you understand?" \n\nThe Englishman nodded, but gave no in- \ndication whether he intended to accept this \nchallenge or not. Anatole did not release him, \nand though he kept nodding to show that he \nunderstood, Anatole went on translating D6- \nlokhov's words into English. A thin young lad, \nan hussar of the Life Guards, who had been \nlosing that evening, climbed on the window \nsill, leaned over, and looked down. \n\n"Ohl Ohl Oh!" he muttered, looking down \nfrom the window at the stones of the pave- \nment. \n\n"Shut up!" cried D61okhov, pushing him \naway from the window. The lad jumped awk- \nwardly back into the room, tripping over his \nspurs. \n\n\n\nPlacing the bottle on the window sill where \nhe could reach it easily, D61okhov climbed \ncarefully and slowly through the window and \nlowered his legs. Pressing against both sides \nof the window, he adjusted himself on his seat, \nlowered his hands, moved a little to the right \nand then to the left, and took up the bottle. \nAnatole brought two candles and placed them \non the window sill, though it was already quite \nlight. Dolokhov's back in his white shirt, and \nhis curly head, were lit up from both sides. \nEveryone crowded to the window, the English- \nman in front. Pierre stood smiling but silent. \nOne man, older than the others present, sud- \ndenly pushed forward with a scared and angry \nlook and wanted to seize hold of Dolokhov's \nshirt. \n\n"I say, this is folly! He'll be killed," said this \nmore sensible man. \n\nAnatole stopped him. \n\n"Don't touch him! You'll startle him and \nthen he'll be killed. Eh? ... What then? . . . \nEh?" \n\nD61okhov turned round and, again holding \non with both hands, arranged himself on his \nscat. \n\n"If anyone comes meddling again," said he, \nemitting the words separately through his thin \ncompressed lips, "I willthrowhim down there. \nNow then!" \n\nSaying this he again turned round, dropped \nhis hands, took the bottle and lifted it to his \nlips, threw back his head, and raised his free \nhand to balance himself. One of the footmen \nwho had stooped to pick up some broken glass \nremained in that position without taking his \neyes from the window and from D61okhov's \nback. Anatole stood erect with staring eyes. \nThe Englishman looked on sideways, pursing \nup his lips. The man who had wished to stop \nthe affair ran to a corner of the room and \nthrew himself on a sofa with his face to the \nwall. Pierre hid his face, from which a faint \nsmile forgot to fade though his features now \nexpressed horror and fear. All were still. Pierre \ntook his hands from his eyes. Dolokhov still \nsat in the same position, only his head was \nthrown further back till his curly hair touched \nhis shirt collar, and the hand holding the bot- \ntle was lifted higher and higher and trembled \nwith the effort. The bottle was emptying per- \nceptibly and rising still higher and his head \ntilting yet further back. "Why is it so long?" \nthought Pierre. It seemed to him that more \nthan half an hour had elapsed. Suddenly D6- \nlokhov made a backward movement with his \n\n\n\ni8 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nspine, and his arm trembled nervously; this \nwas sufficient to cause his whole body to slip as \nhe sat on the sloping ledge. As he began slip- \nping down, his head and arm wavered still \nmore with the strain. One hand moved as if to \nclutch the window sill, but refrained from \ntouching it. Pierre again covered his eyes and \nthought he would never open them again. Sud- \ndenly he was aware of a stir all around. He \nlooked up: D61okhov was standing on the win- \ndow sill, with a pale but radiant face. \n"It's empty!" \n\nHe threw the bottle to the Englishman, who \ncaught it neatly. D61okhov jumped down. He \nsmelt strongly of rum. \n\n"Well done! . . . Fine fellow! . . . There's a \nbet for you! . . . Devil take you!" came from \ndifferent sides. \n\nThe Englishman took out his purse and be- \ngan counting out the money. Drilokhov stood \nfrowning and did not speak. Pierre jumped \nupon the window sill. \n\n"Gentlemen, who wishes to bet with me? I'll \ndo the same thing!" he suddenly cried. "Even \nwithout a bet, there! Tell them to bring me a \n\nbottle. I'll do it Bring a bottle!" \n\n"Let him do it, let him do it," saidD61okhov, \nsmiling. \n\n"What next? Have you gone mad? . . . No \none would let you! . . . Why, you go giddy even \non a staircase," exclaimed several voices. \n\n"I'll drink it! Let's have a bottle of rum!" \nshouted Pierre, banging the table with a deter- \nmined and drunken gesture and preparing to \nclimb out of the window. \n\nThey seized him by his arms; but he was so \nstrong that everyone who touched him was \nsent flying. \n\n"No, you'll never manage him that way," \nsaid Anatole. "Wait a bit and I'll get round \nhim. . . . Listen! I'll take your bet tomorrow, \nbut now we are all going to V \n\n"Come on then," cried Pierre. "Come on! \n. . . And we'll take Bruin with us." \n\nAnd he caught the bear, took it in his arms, \nlifted it from the ground, and began dancing \nround the room with it. \n\nCHAPTER X \n\nPRINCE Vxsiii kept the promise he had given \nto Princess Drubetskaya who had spoken to \nhim on behalf of her only son Boris on the \nevening of Anna Pdvlovna's soiree. The mat- \nter was mentioned to the Emperor, an excep- \ntion made, and Boris transferred into the regi- \nment of Semenov Guards with the rank of cor- \n\n\n\nnet. He received, however, no appointment \nto Ku c tiizov's staff despite all Anna Mikhay- \nlovna's endeavors and entreaties. Soon after \nAnna Pdvlovna's reception Anna Mikhdylovna \nreturned to Moscow and went straight to her \nrich relations, the Rost6vs, with whom she \nstayed when in the town and where her darling \nB6ry, who had only just entered a regiment of \nthe line and was being at once transferred to \nthe Guards as a cornet, had been educated \nfrom childhood and lived for years at a time. \nThe Guards had already left Petersburg on the \ntenth of August, and her son, who had re- \nmained in Moscow for his equipment, was to \njoin them on the march to Radzivilov. \n\nIt was St. Natalia's day and the name day of \ntwo of the Rost6vs the mother and the young- \nest daughter both named Nataly. Ever since \nthe morning, carriages with six horses had been \ncoming and going continually, bringing visi- \ntors to the Countess Rost6va's big house on the \nPovarskaya, so well known to all Moscow. The \ncountess herself and her handsome eldest \ndaughter were in the drawing-room with the \nvisitors who came to congratulate, and who \nconstantly succeeded one another in relays. \n\nThe countess was a woman of about forty- \nfive, with a thin Oriental type of face, evidently \nworn out with childbearing she had had \ntwelve. A languor of motion and speech, re- \nsulting from weakness, gave her a distinguished \nair which inspired respect. Princess Anna Mi- \nkMylovna Drubetskdya, who as a member of \nthe household was also seated in the drawing \nroom, helped to receive and entertain the visi- \ntors. The young people were in one of the \ninner rooms, not considering it necessary to \ntake part in receiving the visitors. The count \nmet the guests and saw them off, inviting them \nall to dinner. \n\n"I am very, very grateful to you, mon cher" or \n"ma chre" he called everyone without excep- \ntion and without the slightest variation in his \ntone, "my dear," whether they were above or \nbelow him in rank "I thank you for myself \nand for our two dear ones whose name day \nwe are keeping. But mind you come to dinner \nor I shall be offended, ma chtre! On behalf of \nthe whole family I beg you to come, mon cher!" \nThese words he repeated to everyone without \nexception or variation, and with the same ex- \npression on his full, cheerful, clean-shaven \nface, the same firm pressure of the hand and \nthe same quick, repeated bows. As soon as he \nhad seen a visitor off he returned to one of \nthose who were still in the drawing room, \n\n\n\nBOOK ONE \n\n\n\ndrew a chair toward him or her, and jauntily \nspreading out his legs and putting hi hands \non his knees with the air of a man who enjoys \nlife and knows how to live, he swayed to and \nfro with dignity, offered surmises about the \nweather, or touched on questions of health, \nsometimes in Russian and sometimes in very \nbad but self-confident French; then again, like \na man weary but unflinching in the fulfillment \nof duty, he rose to see some visitors off and, \nstroking his scanty gray hairs over his bald \npatch, also asked them to dinner. Sometimes \non his way back from the anteroom he would \npass through the conservatory and pantry into \nthe large marble dining hall, where tables were \nbeing set out for eighty people; and looking \nat the footmen, who were bringing in silver \nand china, moving tables, and unfolding dam- \nask table linen, he would call Dmitri Vasfle- \nvich, a man of good family and the manager of \nall his affairs, and while looking with pleasure \nat the enormous table would say: "Well, \nDmitri, you'll see that things are all as they \nshould be? That's right! The great thing is the \nserving, that's it." And with a complacent sigh \nhe would return to the drawing room. \n\n"Mrya Lv6vna Kardgina and her daugh- \nter!" announced the countess' gigantic foot- \nman in his bass voice, entering the drawing \nroom. The countess reflected a moment and \ntook a pinch from a gold snuffbox with her \nhusband's portrait on it. \n\n"I'm quite worn out by these callers. How- \never, I'll see her and no more. She is so affected. \nAsk her in," she said to the footman in a sad \nvoice, as if saying : "Very well, finish me off." \n\nA tall, stout, and proud-looking woman, with \na round-faced smiling daughter, entered the \ndrawing room, their dresses rustling. \n\n"Dear Countess, what an age . . . She has \nbeen laid up, poor child ... at the Razum6v- \nski's ball . . . and Countess Aprdksina ... I was \nso delighted ..." came the sounds of animated \nfeminine voices, interrupting one another and \nmingling with the rustling of dresses and the \nscraping of chairs. Then one of those conver- \nsations began which last out until, at the first \npause, the guests rise with a rustle of dresses \nand say, "I am so delighted . . . Mamma's \nhealth . . . and Countess Apraksina . . ." and \nthen, again rustling, pass into the anteroom, \nput on cloaks or mantles, and drive away. The \nconversation was on the chief topic of the day: \nthe illness of the wealthy and celebrated beau \nof Catherine's day, Count Bezukhov,and about \nhis illegitimate son Pierre, the one who had \n\n\n\nbehaved so improperly at Anna Pdvlovna's re- \nception. \n\n"I am so sorry for the poor count," said the \nvisitor. "He is in such bad health, and now this \nvexation about his son is enough to kill him!" \n\n"What is that?" asked the countess as if she \ndid not know what the visitor alluded to, \nthough she had already heard about the cause \nof Count Bezrikhov's distress some fifteen times. \n\n"That's what comes of a modern educa- \ntion," exclaimed the visitor. "It seems that \nwhile he was abroad this young man was al- \nlowed to do as he liked, and now in Petersburg \nI hear he has been doing such terrible things \nthat he has been expelled by the police." \n\n"You don't say so!" replied the countess. \n\n"He chose his friends badly," interposed \nAnna Mikhaylovna. "Prince Vasili's son, he, \nand a certain Dolokhov have, it is said, been \nup to heaven only knows what! And they have \nhad to suffer for it. D61okhov has been de- \ngraded to the ranks and Bezukhov's son sent \nback to Moscow. Anatole Kurdgin's father \nmanaged somehow to get his son's affair \nhushed up, but even he was ordered out of \nPetersburg." \n\n"But what have they been up to?" asked the \ncountess. \n\n"They are regular brigands, especially D6- \nlokhov," replied f the visitor. "He is a son of \nMdrya Ivdnovna" D6tpkhova, such a worthy \nwoman, but there, just fancy! Those three got \nhold of a bear somewhere, put it in a carriage, \nand set off with it to visit some actresses! The \npolice tried to interfere, and what did the \nyoung men do? They tied a policeman and the \nbear back to back and put the bear into the \nMoyka Canal. And there was the bear swim- \nming about with the policeman on his back!" \n\n"What a nice figure the policeman must \nhave cut, my dear!" shouted the count, dying \nwith laughter, \n\n"Oh, how dreadful! How can you laugh at \nit, Count?" \n\nYet the ladies themselves could not help \nlaughing. \n\n"It was all they could do to rescue the poor \nman," continued the visitor. "And to think it \nis Cyril Vladimirovich Bezukhov's son who \namuses himself in this sensible manner! And \nhe was said to be so well educated and clever. \nThis is all that his foreign education has done \nfor him! I hope that here in Moscow no one \nwill receive him, in spite of his money. They \nwanted to introduce him to me, but I quite \ndeclined: I have my daughters to consider." \n\n\n\n2O \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\n"Why do you say this young man is so rich?" \nasked die countess, turning away from the \ngirls, who at once assumed an air of inatten- \ntion. "His children are all illegitimate. I drink \nPierre also is illegitimate." \n\nThe visitor made a gesture with her hand. \n\n"I should think he has a score of them." \n\nPrincess Anna MikMylovna intervened in \nthe conversation, evidently wishing to show \nher connections and knowledge of what went \non in society. \n\n"The fact of the matter is," said she signifi- \ncantly, and also in a half whisper, "everyone \nknows Count Cyril's reputation. ... He has \nlost count of his children, but this Pierre was \nhis favorite." \n\n"How handsome the old man still was only \na year ago!" remarked the countess. "I have \nnever seen a handsomer man." \n\n"He is very much altered now," said Anna \nMikhaylovna. "Well, as I was saying, Prince \nVasili is the next heir through his wife, but \nthe count is very fond of Pierre, looked after \nhis education, and wrote to the Emperor about \nhim; so that in the case of his death and he is \nso ill that he may die at any moment, and Dr. \nLorrain has come from Petersburg no one \nknows who will inherit his immense fortune, \nPierre or Prince Vasili. Forty thousand serfs \nand millions of rubles! I know it all very well \nfor Prince Vasili told me himself. Besides, \nCyril Vladimirovich is my mother's second \ncousin. He's also my B6ry's godfather," she \nadded, as if she attached no importance at all \nto the fact. \n\n"Prince Vasili arrived in Moscow yesterday. \nI hear he has come on some inspection busi- \nness," remarked the visitor. \n\n"Yes, but between ourselves," said the prin- \ncess, "that is a pretext. The fact is he has come \nto see Count Cyril Vladimirovich, hearing how \nill he is." \n\n"But do you know, my dear, that was a capi- \ntal joke," said the count; and seeing that the \nelder visitor was not listening, he turned to \nthe young ladies. "I can just imagine what a \nfunny figure that policeman cut!" \n\nAnd as he waved his arms to impersonate \nthe policeman, his portly form again shook \nwith a deep ringing laugh, the laugh of one \nwho always eats well and, in particular, drinks \nwell. "So do come and dine with usl" he said. \n\nCHAPTER XI \n\nSILENCE ENSUED. The countess looked at her \ncallers, smiling affably, but not concealing the \n\n\n\nfact that she would not be distressed if they \nnow r&lt;,se and took their leave. The visitor's \ndaughter was already smoothing down her \ndress with an inquiring look at her mother, \nwhen suddenly from the next room were heard \nthe footsteps of boys and girls running to the \ndoor and the noise of a chair falling over, and \na girl of thirteen, hiding something in the \nfolds of her short muslin frock, darted in and \nstopped short in the middle of the room. It \nwas evident that she had not intended her \nflight to bring her so far. Behind Her in the door- \nway appeared a student with a crimson coat \ncollar, an officer of the Guards, a girl of fifteen, \nand a plump rosy-faced boy in a short jacket. \n\nThe count jumped up and, swaying from \nside to side, spread his arms wide and threw \nthem round the little girl who had run in. \n\n"Ah, here she is!" he exclaimed laughing. \n"My pet, whose name day it is. My dear pet!" \n\n"Ma chtre, there is a time for everything," \nsaid the countess with feigned severity. "You \nspoil her, Ilya," she added, turning to her hus- \nband. \n\n"How do you do, my dear? I wish you many \nhappy returns of your name day," said the \nvisitor. "What a charming child," she added, \naddressing the mother. \n\nThis black-eyed, wide-mouthed girl, not \npretty but full of life with childish bare \nshoulders which after her run heaved and \nshook her bodice, with black curls tossed back- \nward, thin bare arms, little legs in lace-frilled \ndrawers, and feet in low slippers was just at \nthat charming age when a girl is no longer a \nchild, though the child is not yet a young \nwoman. Escaping from her father she ran to \nhide her flushed face in the lace of her mother's \nmantilla not paying the least attention to \nher severe remark and began to laugh. She \nlaughed, and in fragmentary sentences tried \nto explain about a doll which she produced \nfrom the folds of her frock. \n\n"Do you see? . . . My doll . . . Mimi . . . You \nsee . . ." was all Natasha managed to utter (to \nher everything seemed funny). She leaned \nagainst her mother and burst into such a loud, \nringing fit of laughter that even the prim visi- \ntor could not help joining in. \n\n"Now then, go a way and take your monstros- \nity with you," said the mother, pushing away \nher daughter with pretended sternness, and \nturning to the visitor she added: "She is my \nyoungest girl." \n\nNatdsha, raising her face for a moment from \nher mother's mantilla, glanced up at her \n\n\n\nthrough tears of laughter, and again hid her \nface. \n\nThe visitor, compelled to look on at this \nfamily scene, thought it necessary to take some \npart in it. \n\n"Tell me, my dear," said she to Natasha, \n"is Mimi a relation of yours? A daughter, I \nsuppose?" \n\nNatdsha did not like the visitor's tone of \ncondescension to childish things. She did not \nreply, but looked at her seriously. \n\nMeanwhile the younger generation: Boris, \nthe officer, Anna Mikhdylovna's son; Nicholas, \nthe undergraduate, the count's eldest son; \nS6nya, the count's fifteen-year-old niece, and \nlittle P^tya, his youngest boy, had all settled \ndown in the drawing room and were obviously \ntrying to restrain within the bounds of de- \ncorum the excitement and mirth that shone in \nall their faces. Evidently in the back rooms, \nfrom which they had dashed out so impetu- \nously, the conversation had been more amus- \ning than the drawing-room talk of society scan- \ndals, the weather, and Countess Apraksina. \nNow and then they glanced at one another, \nhardly able to suppress their laughter. \n\nThe two young men, the student and the \nofficer, friends from childhood, were of the \nsame age and both handsome fellows, though \nnot alike. Boris was tall and fair, and his calm \nand handsome face had regular, delicate fea- \ntures. Nicholas was short with curly hair and \nan open expression. Dark hairs were already \nshowing on his upper lip, and his whole face \nexpressed impetuosity and enthusiasm. Nicho- \nlas blushed when he entered the drawingroom. \nHe evidently tried to find something to say, \nbut failed. Boris on the contrary at once found \nhis footing, and related quietly and humor- \nously how he had known that doll Mimi when \nshe was still quite a young lady, before her nose \nwas broken; how she had aged during the five \nyears he had known her, and how her head \nhad cracked right across the skull. Having said \nthis he glanced at Natdsha. She turned away \nfrom him and glanced at her younger brother, \nwho was screwing up his eyes and shaking \nwith suppressed laughter, and unable to con- \ntrol herself any longer, she jumped up and \nrushed from the room as fast as her nimble \nlittle feet would carry her. Boris did not laugh. \n\n"You were meaning to go out, weren't you, \nMamma? Do you want the carriage?" he asked \nhis mother with a smile. \n\n"Yes, yes, go and tell them to get it ready/' \nshe answered, returning his smile. \n\n\n\nBOOK ONE 21 \n\nBoris quietly left the room and went in \nsearch of Natasha. The plump boy ran after \nthem angrily, as if vexed that their program \nhad been disturbed. \n\nTHE ONLY young people remaining in the \ndrawing room, not counting the young lady \nvisitor and the countess' eldest daughter (who \nwas four years older than her sister and be- \nhaved already like a grown-up person), were \nNicholas and S6nya, the niece. S6nya was a \nslender little brunette with a tender look in \nher eyes which were veiled by long lashes, \nthick black plaits coiling twice round her head, \nand a tawny tint in her complexion and espe- \ncially in the color of her slender but graceful \nand muscular arms and neck. By the grace of \nher movements, by the softness and flexibility \nof her small limbs, and by a certain coyness \nand reserve of manner, she reminded one of a \npretty, half-grown kitten which promises to \nbecome a beautiful little cat. She evidently \nconsidered it proper to show an interest in the \ngeneral conversation by smiling, but in spite \nof herself her eyes under their thick long lashes \nwatched her cousin who was going to join the \narmy, with such passionate girlish adoration \nthat her smile could not for a single instant \nimpose upon anyone, and it was clear that the \nkitten had settled down only to spring up with \nmore energy and again play with her cousin \nas soon as they too could, like Natdsha and \nBoris, escape from the drawing room. \n\n"Ah yes, my dear," said the count, addressing \nthe visitor and pointing to Nicholas, "his \nfriend Borfs has become an officer, and so for \nfriendship's sake he is leaving the university \nand me, his old father, and entering the mili- \ntary service, my dear. And there was a place \nand everything waiting for him in the Archives \nDepartment! Isn't that friendship?" remarked \nthe count in an inquiring tone. \n\n"But they say that war has been declared," \nreplied the visitor. \n\n"They've been saying so a long while," said \nthe count, "and they'll say so again and again, \nand that will be the end of it. My dear, there's \nfriendship for you," he repeated. "He's join- \ning the hussars." \n\nThe visitor, not knowing what to say, shook \nher head. \n\n"It's not at all from friendship," declared \nNicholas, flaring up and turning away as it \nfrom a shameful aspersion. "It is not from \nfriendship at all; I simply feel that the army is \nmy vocation." \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nHe glanced at his cousin and the young lady \nvisitor; and they were both regarding him with \na smile of approbation. \n\n"Schubert, the colonel of the Pdvlograd Hus- \nsars, is dining with us today. He has been here \non leave and is taking Nicholas back with him. \nIt can't be helped!" said the count, shrugging \nhis shoulders and speaking playfully of a mat- \nter that evidently distressed him. \n\n"I have already told you, Papa," said his son, \n"that if you don't wish to let me go, I'll stay. \nBut I know I am no use anywhere except in \nthe army; I am not a diplomat or a govern- \nment clerk. I don't know how to hide what \nI feel." As he spoke he kept glancing with the \nflirtatiousness of a handsome youth at S6nya \nand the young lady visitor. \n\nThe little kitten, feasting her eyes on him, \nseemed ready at any moment to start her gam- \nbols again and display her kittenish nature. \n\n"All right, all right!" said the old count. "He \nalways flares up! This Buonaparte has turned \nall their heads; they all think of how he rose \nfrom an ensign and became Emperor. Well, \nwell, God grant it," he added, not noticing his \nvisitor's sarcastic smile. \n\nThe elders began talking about Bonaparte. \nJulie Kardgina turned to young Rost6v. \n\n"What a pity you weren't at the Arkharovs' \non Thursday. It was so dull without you," said \nshe, giving him a tender smile. \n\nThe young man, flattered, sat down nearer \nto her with a coquettish smile, and engaged \nthe smiling Julie in a confidential conversa- \ntion without at all noticing that his involun- \ntary smile had stabbed the heart of S6nya, who \nblushed and smiled unnaturally. In the midst \nof his talk he glanced round at her. She gave \nhim a passionately angry glance, and hardly \nable to restrain her tears and maintain the \nartificial smile on her lips, she got up and left \nthe room. All Nicholas' animation vanished. \nHe waited for the first pause in the conversa- \ntion, and then with a distressed face left the \nroom to find Sony a. \n\n"How plainly all these young people wear \ntheir hearts on their sleeves!" said Anna Mi- \nkhdylovna, pointing to Nicholas as he went \nout. "Cousinage dangereux voisinage" 1 she \nadded. \n\n"Yes," said the countess when the brightness \nthese young people had brought into the room \nhad vanished; and as if answering a question \nno one had put but which was always in her \nmind, "and how much suffering, how much \n\n1 Cousin hood is a dangerous neighborhood. \n\n\n\nanxiety one has had to go through that we \nmight rejoice in them now! And yet really the \nanxiety is greater now than the joy. One is \nalways, always anxious! Especially just at this \nage, so dangerous both for girls and boys." \n\n"It all depends on the bringing up," re- \nmarked the visitor. \n\n"Yes, you're quite right," continued the \ncountess. "Till now I have always, thank God, \nbeen my children's friend and had their full \nconfidence," said she, repeating the mistake of \nso many parents who imagine that their chil- \ndren have no secrets from them. "I know I \nshall always be my daughters' first confidante, \nand that if Nicholas, with his impulsive na- \nture, does get into mischief (a boy can't help \nit), he will all the same never be like those \nPetersburg young men." \n\n"Yes, they are splendid, splendid young- \nsters," chimed in the count, who always solved \nquestions that seemed to him perplexing by \ndeciding that everything was splendid. "Just \nfancy: wants to be an hussar. What's one to do, \nmy dear?" \n\n"What a charming creature your younger \ngirl is," said the visitor; "a little volcano!" \n\n"Yes, a regular volcano," said the count. \n"Takes after me! And what a voice she has; \nthough she's my daughter, I tell the truth when \nI say she'll be a singer, a second Salomoni! We \nhave engaged an Italian to give her lessons." \n\n"Isn't she too young? I have heard that it \nharms the voice to train it at that age." \n\n"Oh no, not at all too young!" replied the \ncount. "Why, our mothers used to be married \nat twelve or thirteen." \n\n"And she's in love with Boris already. Just \nfancy!" said the countess with a gentle smile, \nlooking at Bon's' mother, and went on, evi- \ndently concerned with a thought that always \noccupied her: "Now you see if I were to be \nsevere with her and to forbid it ... goodness \nknows what they might be up to on the sly" \n(she meant that they would be kissing), "but \nas it is, I know every word she utters. She will \ncome running to me of her own accord in the \nevening and tell me everything. Perhaps I \nspoil her, but really that seems the best plan. \nWith her elder sister I was stricter." \n\n"Yes, I was brought up quite differently," \nremarked the handsome elder daughter, Count- \ness Ve*ra, with a smile. \n\nBut the smile did not enhance V&amp;ra's beauty \nas smiles generally do; on the contrary it gave \nher an unnatural, and therefore unpleasant, \nexpression. Ve*ra was good-looking, not at all \n\n\n\nBOOK ONE \n\n\n\nstupid, quick at learning, was well brought up, \nand had a pleasant voice; what she said was \ntrue and appropriate, yet, strange to say, every- \nonethe visitors and countess aliketurned \nto look at her as if wondering why she had said \nit, and they all felt awkward. \n\n"People are always too clever with their eld- \nest children and try to make something excep- \ntional of them," said the visitor. \n\n"What's the good of denying it, my dear? \nOur dear countess was too clever with Wra," \nsaid the count. "Well, what of that? She's \nturned out splendidly all the same," he added, \nwinking at V^ra. \n\nThe guests got up and took their leave, \npromising to return to dinner. \n\n"What manners! I thought they would never \ngo," said the countess, when she had seen her \nguests out. \n\nCHAPTER XIII \n\nWHEN Natdsha ran out of the drawing room \nshe only went as far as the conservatory. There \nshe paused and stood listening to the conver- \nsation in the drawing room, waiting for Boris \nto come out. She was already growing impa- \ntient, and stamped her foot, ready to cry at his \nnot coming at once, when she heard the young \nman's discreet steps approaching neither quick- \nly nor slowly. At this Natasha dashed swiftly \namong the flower tubs and hid there. \n\nBoris paused in the middle of the room, \nlooked round, brushed a little dust from the \nsleeve of his uniform, and going up to a mirror \nexamined his handsome face. Natdsha, very \nstill, peered out from her ambush, waiting to \nsee what he would do. He stood a little while \nbefore the glass, smiled, and walked toward \nthe other door. Natasha was about to call him \nbut changed her mind. "Let him look for me," \nthought she. Hardly had Boris gone than \nS6nya, flushed, in tears, and muttering angrily, \ncame in at the other door. Natdsha checked \nher first impulse to run out to her, and re- \nmained in her hiding place, watching as un- \nder an invisible cap to see what went on in the \nworld. She was experiencing a new and pecul- \niar pleasure. S6nya, muttering to herself, kept \nlooking round toward the drawing-room door. \nIt opened and Nicholas came in. \n\n"S6nya, what is the matter with you? How \ncan you?" said he, running up to her. \n\n"It's nothing, nothing; leave me alone!" \nsobbed S6nya. \n\n"Ah, I know what it is." \n\n"Well, if you do, so much the better, and \n\n\n\nyou can go back to her!" \n\n"S6-o-onya! Look here! How can you tor- \nture me and yourself like that, for a mere \nfancy?" said Nicholas taking her hand. \n\nS6nya did not pull it away, and left off cry- \ning. Natdsha, not stirring and scarcely breath- \ning, watched from her ambush with sparkling \neyes. "What will happen now?" thought she. \n\n"Sonya! What is anyone in the world to me? \nYou alone are everything!" said Nicholas. \n"And I will prove it to you." \n\n"I don't like you to talk like that." \n\n"Well, then, I won't; only forgive me, \nS6nya!" He drew her to him and kissed her. \n\n"Oh, how nice," thought Natdsha; and when \nS6nya and Nicholas had gone out of the con- \nservatory she followed and called Boris to her. \n\n"Boris, come here," said she with a sly and \nsignificant look. "I have something to tell you. \nHere, here!" and she led him into the conserv- \natory to the place among the tubs where she \nhad been hiding. \n\nBoris followed her, smiling. \n\n"What is the something?" asked he. \n\nShe grew confused, glanced round, and, see- \ning the doll she had thrown down on one of \nthe tubs, picked it up. \n\n"Kiss the doll," said she. \n\nBoris looked attentively and kindly at her \neager face, but did not reply. \n\n"Don't you want to? Well, then, come here," \nsaid she, and went further in among the plants \nand threw down the doll. "Closer, closer!" she \nwhispered. \n\nShe caught the young officer by his cuffs, and \na look of solemnity and fear appeared on her \nflushed face. \n\n"And me? Would you like to kiss me?" she \nwhispered almost inaudibly, glancing up at \nhim from under her brows, smiling, and al- \nmost crying from excitement. \n\nBoris blushed. \n\n"How funny you are!" he said, bending \ndown to her and blushing still more, but he \nwaited and did nothing. \n\nSuddenly she jumped up onto a tub to be \nhigher than he, embraced him so that both her \nslender bare arms clasped him above his neck, \nand, tossing back her hair, kissed him full on \nthe lips. \n\nThen she slipped down among the flower- \npots on the other side of the tubs and stood, \nhanging her head. \n\n"Natdsha," he said, "you know that I love \nyou, but . . ." \n\n"You are in love with me?" Natdsha broke in. \n\n\n\n24 \n\n"Yes, I am, but please don't let us do like \nthat. ... In another four years . . . then I will \nask for your hand." \n\nNatasha considered. \n\n"Thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen," she \ncounted on her slender little fingers. "All rightl \nThen it's settled?" \n\nA smile of joy and satisfaction lit up her \neager face. \n\n"Settled!" replied Boris. \n\n"Forever?" said the little girl. "Till death \nitself?" \n\nShe took his arm and with a happy face went \nwith him into the adjoining sitting room. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV \n\nAFTER RECEIVING her visitors, the countess was \nso tired that she gave orders to admit no more, \nbut the porter was told to be sure to invite to \ndinner all who came "to congratulate." The \ncountess wished to have a te'te-a-te'te talk with \nthe friend of her childhood, Princess Anna \nMikhdylovna, whom she had not seen properly \nsince she returned from Petersburg. Anna \nMikhiylovna, with her tear- worn but pleasant \nface, drew her chair nearer to that of the \ncountess. \n\n"With you I will be quite frank," said Anna \nMikMylovna. "There are not many left of us \nold friends! That's why I so value your friend- \nship." \n\nAnna Mikhdylovna looked at Wra and \npaused. The countess pressed her friend's hand. \n\n"Wra," she said to her eldest daughter who \nwas evidently not a favorite, "how is it you \nhave so little tact? Don't you see you are not \nwanted here? Go to the other girls, or ..." \n\nThe handsome Wra smiled contemptuously \nbut did not seem at all hurt. \n\n"If you had told me sooner, Mamma, I would \nhave gone," she replied as she rose to go to her \nown room. \n\nBut as she passed the sitting room she no- \nticed two couples sitting, one pair at each win- \ndow. She stopped and smiled scornfully. S6nya \nwas sitting close to Nicholas who was copying \nout some verses for her, the first he had ever \nwritten. Boris and Natdsha were at the other \nwindow and ceased talking when Wra entered. \nS6nya and Natasha looked at Wra with guilty, \nhappy faces. \n\nIt was pleasant and touching to see these \nlittle girls in love; but apparently the sight of \nthem roused no pleasant feeling in Wra. \n\n"How often have I asked you not to take \nmy things?" she said. "You have a room of your \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\nown," ( and she took the inkstand from Nicholas. \n\n"In a minute, in a minute," he said, dipping \nhis pen. \n\n"You always manage to do things at the \nwrong time," continued Wra. "You came \nrushing into the drawing room so that every- \none felt ashamed of you." \n\nThough what she said was quite just, per- \nhaps for that very reason no one replied, and \nthe four simply looked at one another. She \nlingered in the room with the inkstand in her \nhand. \n\n"And at your age what secrets can there be \nbetween Natdsha and Boris, or between you \ntwo? It's all nonsense!" \n\n"Now, Wra, what does it matter to you?" \nsaid Natasha in defense, speaking very gently. \n\nShe seemed that day to be more than ever \nkind and affectionate to everyone. \n\n"Very silly," said Wra. "I am ashamed of \nyou. Secrets indeed!" \n\n"All have secrets of their own," answered \nNatasha, getting warmer. "We don't interfere \nwith you and Berg." \n\n"I should think not," said Wra, "because \nthere can never be anything wrong in my be- \nhavior. But I'll just tell Mamma how you are \nbehaving with Boris." \n\n"Natlyallynichna behaves very well to me," \nremarked Boris. "I have nothing to complain \nof." \n\n"Don't, Boris! You are such a diplomat that \nit is really tiresome," said Natasha in a morti- \nfied voice that trembled slightly. (She used \nthe word "diplomat," which was just then much \nin vogue among the children, in the special \nsense they attached to it.) "Why does she \nbother me?" And she added, turning to Wra, \n"You'll never understand it, because you've \nnever loved anyone. You have no heart! You \nare a Madame de Genlis 1 and nothing more" \n(this nickname, bestowed on Wra by Nicholas, \nwas considered very stinging), "and your great- \nest pleasure is to be unpleasant to people! Go \nand flirt with Berg as much as you please," she \nfinished quickly. \n\n"I shall at any rate not run after a young \nman before visitors ..." \n\n"Well, now you've done what you wanted," \nput in Nicholas "said unpleasant things to \neveryone and upset them. Let's go to the nurs- \nery." \n\nAll four, like a flock of scared birds, got up \nand left the room. \n\n\n\n*A French writer of that period, authoress of \neducational works and novels. TR. \n\n\n\nBOOK ONE \n\n\n\n"The unpleasant things were said t&lt;j me," \nremarked Vera, "I said none to anyone." \n\n"Madame de Genlis! Madame de GenlisI" \nshouted laughing voices through the door. \n\nThe handsome Vdra, who produced such an \nirritating and unpleasant effect on everyone, \nsmiled and, evidently unmoved by what had \nbeen said to her, went to the looking glass and \narranged her hair and scarf. Looking at her \nown handsome face she seemed to become still \ncolder and calmer. \n\nIn the drawing room the conversation was \nstill going on. \n\n"Ah, my dear," said the countess, "my life \nis not all roses either. Don't I know that at the \nrate we are living our means won't last long? \nIt's all the Club and his easygoing nature. Even \nin the country do we get any rest? Theatricals, \nhunting, and heaven knows what besides! But \ndon't let's talk about me; tell me how you \nmanaged every th ing. I often wonder at you, \nAnnette how at your age you can rush off \nalone in a carriage to Moscow, to Petersburg, \nto those ministers and great people, and know \nhow to deal with them all! It's quite astonish- \ning. How did you get things settled? I couldn't \npossibly do it." \n\n"Ah, my love," answered Anna Mikhaylovna, \n"God grant you never know what it is to be \nleft a widow without means and with a son \nyou love to distraction! One learns many things \nthen," she added with a certain pride. "That \nlawsuit taught me much. When I want to see \none of those big people I write a note: 'Prin- \ncess So-and-So desires an interview with So- \nand-So,' and then I take a cab and go myself \ntwo, three, or four times till I get what I want. \nI don't mind what they think of me." \n\n"Well, and to whom did you apply about \nBory?" asked the countess. "You see yours is \nalready an officer in the Guards, while my \nNicholas is going as a cadet. There's no one to \ninterest himself for him. To whom did you \napply?" \n\n"To Prance Vasfli. He was so kind. He at \nonce agreed to everything, and put the matter \nbefore the Emperor," said Princess Anna Mi- \nkhdylovna enthusiastically, quite forgetting all \nthe humiliation she had endured to gain her \nend. \n\n"Has Prince Vasfli aged much?" asked the \ncountess. "I have not seen him since we acted \ntogether at the Rumydntsovs' theatricals. I ex- \npect he has forgotten me. He paid me attentions \nin those days," said the countess, with a smile. \n\n\n\n"He is just the same as ever," replied Anna \nMikhdylovna, "overflowing with amiability. \nHis position has not turned his head at all. He \nsaid to me, 'I am sorry I can do so little for \nyou, dear Princess. I am at your command.' \nYes, he is a fine fellow and a very kind rela- \ntion. But, Nataly, you know my love for my \nson: I would do anything for his happiness! \nAnd my affairs are in such a bad way that my \nposition is now a terrible one," continued \nAnna Mikhaylovna, sadly, dropping her voice. \n"My wretched lawsuit takes all I have and \nmakes no progress. Would you believe it, I \nhave literally not a penny and don't know how \nto equip Boris." She took out her handkerchief \nand began to cry. "I need five hundred rubles, \nand have only one twenty-five-ruble note. I \nam in such a state. . . . My only hope now is \nin Count Cyril Vladimirovich Beziikhov. If he \nwill not assist his godson you know he is Bory's \ngodfather and allow him something for his \nmaintenance, all my trouble will have been \nthrown away. ... I shall not be able to equip \nhim." \n\nThe countess' eyes filled with tears and she \npondered in silence. \n\n"I often think, though, perhaps it's a sin," \nsaid the princess, "that here lives Count Cyril \nVladfmirovith Beziikhov so rich, all alone . . . \nthat tremendous fortune . . . and what is his \nlife worth? It's a burden to him, and B6ry's \nlife is only just beginning. . . ." \n\n"Surely he will leave something to Boris," \nsaid the countess. \n\n"Heaven only knows, my dear! These rich \ngrandees are so selfish. Still, I will take Borfs \nand go to see him at once, and I shall speak \nto him straight out. Let people think what they \nwill of me, it's really all the same to me when \nmy son's fate is at stake." The princess rose. \n"It's now two o'clock and you dine at four. \nThere will just be time." \n\nAnd like a practical Petersburg lady who \nknows how to make the most of time, Anna \nMikhdylovna sent someone to call her son, \nand went into the anteroom with him. \n\n"Good-by, my dear," said she to the countess \nwho saw her to the door, and added in a \nwhisper so that her son should not hear, \n"Wish me good luck." \n\n"Are you going to Count Cyril Vladfmiro- \nvich, my dear?" said the count coming out \nfrom the dining hall into the anteroom, and \nhe added: "If he is better, ask Pierre to dine \nwith us. He has been to the house, you know, \nand danced with the children. Be sure to in- \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nvite him, my dear. We will see how Tards dis- \ntinguishes himself today. He says Count Orl6v \nnever gave such a dinner as ours will bel" \n\nCHAPTER XV \n\n"Mv DEAR Boris," said Princess Anna Mikhdy- \nlovna to her son as Countess Rost6va's car- \nriage in which they were seated drove over the \nstraw-covered street and turned into the wide \ncourtyard of Count Cyril Vladfmirovich Bezu- \nkhov'shouse. "My dear Boris," said the mother, \ndrawing her hand from beneath her old man- \ntle and laying it timidly and tenderly on her \nson's arm, "be affectionate and attentive to \nhim. Count Cyril Vladimirovich is your god- \nfather after all, and your future depends on \nhim. Remember that, my dear, and be nice to \nhim, as you so well know how to be." \n\n"If only I knew that anything besides hu- \nmiliation would come of it . . ." answered her \nson coldly. "But I have promised and will do \nit for your sake." \n\nAlthough the hall porter saw someone's \ncarriage standing at the entrance, after scru- \ntinizing the mother and son (who without ask- \ning to be announced had passed straight \nthrough the glass porch between the rows of \nstatues in niches) and looking significantly at \nthe lady's old cloak, he asked whether they \nwanted the count or the princesses, and, hear- \ning that they wished to see the count, said his \nexcellency was worse today, and that his excel- \nlency was not receiving anyone. \n\n"We may as well go back," said the son in \nFrench. \n\n"My dear!" exclaimed his mother implor- \ningly, again laying her hand on his arm as if \nthat touch might soothe or rouse him. \n\nBoris said no more, but looked inquiringly \nat his mother without taking off his cloak. \n\n"My friend," said Anna Mikhlylovna in \ngentle tones, addressing the hall porter, "I \nknow Count Cyril Vladimirovich is very ill \n. . . that's why I have come ... I am a relation. \nI shall not disturb him, my friend ... I only \nneed see Prince Vasili Serg^evich: he is stay- \ning here, is he not? Please announce me." \n\nThe hall porter sullenly pulled a bell that \nrang upstairs, and turned away. \n\n"Princess Drubetskdya to see Prince Vasili \nSerg^evich," he called to a footman dressed in \nknee breeches, shoes, and a swallow-tail coat, \nwho ran downstairs and looked over from the \nhalfway landing. \n\nThe mother smoothed the folds of her dyed \nsilk dress before a large Venetian mirror in \n\n\n\nthe wajl, and in her trodden-down shoes brisk- \nly ascended the carpeted stairs. \n\n"My dear," she said to her son, once more \nstimulating him by a touch, "you promised \nme!" \n\nThe son, lowering his eyes, followed her \nquietly. \n\nThey entered the large hall, from which one \nof the doors led to the apartments assigned to \nPrince Vasili. \n\nJust as the mother and son, having reached \nthe middle of the hall, were about to ask their \nway of an elderly footman who had sprung up \nas they entered, the bronze handle of one of \nthe doors turned and Prince Vasili came out- \nwearing a velvet coat with a single star on his \nbreast, as was his custom when at home tak- \ning leave of a good-looking, dark-haired man. \nThis was the celebrated Petersburg doctor, \nLorrain. \n\n"Then it is certain?" said the prince. \n\n"Prince, humanum est errare, 1 but . . ." re- \nplied the doctor, swallowing his r% and pro- \nnouncing the Latin words with a French ac- \ncent. \n\n"Very well, very well . . ." \n\nSeeing Anna Mikhdylovna and her son, \nPrince Vasili dismissed the doctor with a bow \nand approached them silently and with a look \nof inquiry. The son noticed that an expression \nof profound sorrow suddenly clouded his \nmother's face, and he smiled slightly. \n\n"Ah, Prince! In what sad circumstances we \nmeet again! And how is our dear invalid?" \nsaid she, as though unaware of the cold of- \nfensive look fixed on her. \n\nPrince Vasili stared at her and at Boris ques- \ntioningly and perplexed. Boris bowed polite- \nly. Prince Vasili without acknowledging the \nbow turned to Anna Mikhdylovna, answering \nher query by a movement of the head and lips \nindicating very little hope for the patient. \n\n"Is it possible?" exclaimed Anna Mikhdy- \nlovna. "Oh, how awful! It is terrible to think. \n. . . This is my son," she added, indicating \nBoris. "He wanted to thank you himself." \n\nBoris bowed again politely. * \n\n"Believe me, Prince, a mother's heart will \nnever forget what you have done for us." \n\n"I am glad I was able to do you a service, my \ndear Anna Mikhdylovna," said Prince Vasili, \narranging his lace frill, and in tone and man- \nner, here in Moscow to Anna Mikhdylovna \nwhom he had placed under an obligation, as- \nsuming an air of much greater importance than \n\n1 To err is human. \n\n\n\nBOOK ONE \n\n\n\nhe had done in Petersburg at Anna Sender's \nreception. f \n\n"Try to serve well and show yourself worthy," \nadded he, addressing Boris with severity. "I \nam glad. . . . Are you here on leave?" he went \non in his usual tone of indifference. \n\n"I am awaiting orders to join my new regi- \nment, your excellency," replied Boris, betray- \ning neither annoyance at the prince's brusque \nmanner nor a desire to enterinto conversation, \nbut speaking so quietly and respectfully that \nthe prince gave him a searching glance. \n\n"Are you living with your mother?" \n\n"I am living at Countess Rost6va's," replied \nBoris, again adding, "your excellency." \n\n"That is, with Ilyd Rost6v who married Na- \ntaly Shinshina," said Anna Mikhaylovna. \n\n"I know, I know," answered Prince Vasili in \nhis monotonous voice. "I never could under- \nstand how Nataly made up her mind to marry \nthat unlicked bear! A perfectly absurd and \nstupid fellow, and a gambler too, I am told." \n\n"But a very kind man, Prince," said Anna \nMikhaylovna with a pathetic smile, as though \nshe too knew that Count Rost6v deserved this \ncensure, but asked him not to be too hard on \nthe poor old man. "What do the doctors say?" \nasked the princess after a pause, her worn face \nagain expressing deep sorrow. \n\n"They give little hope," replied the prince. \n\n"And I should so like to thank Uncle once \nfor all his kindness to me and Boris. He is his \ngodson," she added, her tone suggesting that \nthis fact ought to give Prince Vasili much satis- \nfaction. \n\nPrince Vasili became thoughtful and \nfrowned. Anna Mikhdylovna saw that he was \nafraid of finding in her a rival for Count Be- \nzukhov's fortune, and hastened to reassure him. \n\n"If it were not for my sincere affection and \ndevotion to Uncle" said she, uttering the word \nwith peculiar assurance and unconcern, "I \nknow his character: noble, upright . . . but you \nsee he has no one with him except the young \nprincesses. . . . They are still young. . . ." She \nbent her head and continued in a whisper: \n"Has he performed his final duty, Prince? How \npriceless are those last moments! It can make \nthings no worse, and it is absolutely necessary \nto prepare him if he is so ill. We women, Prince," \nand she smiled tenderly, "always know how to \nsay these things. I absolutely must see him, \nhowever painful it may be for me. I am used to \nsuffering." \n\nEvidently the prince understood her, and al- \nso understood, as he had done at Anna Pdvlov- \n\n\n\nna's, that it would be difficult to get rid of Anna \nMikhlylovna. \n\n"Would not such a meeting be too trying for \nhim, dear Anna Mikhdylovna?" said he. "Let \nus wait until evening. The doctors are expect- \ning a crisis." \n\n"But one cannot delay, Prince, at such a mo- \nment! Consider that the welfare of his soul is \nat stake. Ah, it is awful: the duties of a Chris- \ntian . . ." \n\nA door of one of the inner rooms opened and \none of the princesses, the count's niece, entered \nwith a cold, stern face. The length of her body \nwas strikingly out of proportion to her short \nlegs. Prince Vasili turned to her. \n\n"Well, how is he?" \n\n"Still the same; but what can you expect, this \nnoise . . ." said the princess, looking at Anna \nMikhlylovna as at a stranger. \n\n"Ah, my dear, I hardly knew you," said Anna \nMikhdylovna with a happy smile, ambling \nlightly up to the count's niece. "I have come, \nand am at your service to help you nurse my \nuncle. I imagine what you have gone through," \nand she sympathetically turned up her eyes. \n\nThe princess gave no reply and did not even \nsmile, but left the room at once. Anna Mikhay- \nlovna took off her gloves and, occupying the \nposition she had conquered, settled down in an \narmchair, inviting Prince Vasfli to take a seat \nbeside her. \n\n"Boris," she said to her son with a smile, "I \nshall go in to see the count, my uncle; but you, \nmy dear, had better go to Pierre meanwhile and \ndon't forget to give him the Rost6vs' invita- \ntion. They ask him to dinner. I suppose he \nwon't go?" she continued, turning to the prince. \n\n"On the contrary," replied the prince, who \nhad plainly become depressed, "I shall be only \ntoo glad if you relieve me of that young man. \n. . . Here he is, and the count has not once \nasked for him." \n\nHe shrugged his shoulders. A footman con- \nducted Boris down one flight of stairs and up \nanother, to Pierre's rooms. \n\nCHAPTER XVI \n\nPIERRE, after all, had not managed to choose a \ncareer for himself in Petersburg, and had been \nexpelled from there for riotous conduct and \nsent to Moscow. The story told about him at \nCount Rost6v's was true. Pierre had taken part \nin tying a policeman to a bear. He had now \nbeen for some days in Moscow and was staying \nas usual at his father's house. Though he ex- \npected that the story of his escapade would be \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nalready known in Moscow and that the ladies \nabout his father who were never favorably \ndisposed toward him would have used it to \nturn the count against him, he nevertheless on \nthe day of his arrival went to his father's part \nof the house. Entering the drawing room, where \nthe princesses spent most of their time, he \ngreeted the ladies, two of whom were sitting at \nembroidery frames while a third read aloud. It \nwas the eldest who was reading the one who \nhad met Anna Mikhdylovna. The two younger \nones were embroidering: both were rosy and \npretty and they differed only in that one had a \nlittle mole on her lip which made her much \nprettier. Pierre was received as if he were a \ncorpse or a leper. The eldest princess paused \nin her reading and silently stared at him with \nfrightened eyes; the second assumed precisely \nthe same expression; while the youngest, the \none with the mole, who was of a cheerful and \nlively disposition, bent over her frame to hide \na smile probably evoked by the amusing scene \nshe foresaw. She drew her wool down through \nthe canvas and, scarcely able to refrain from \nlaughing, stooped as if trying to make out the \npattern. \n\n"How do you do, cousin?" said Pierre. "You \ndon't recognize me?" \n\n"I recognize you only too well, too well." \n\n"How is the count? Can I see him?" asked \nPierre, awkwardly as usual, but unabashed. \n\n"The count is suffering physically and men- \ntally, and apparently you have done your best \nto increase his mental sufferings." \n\n"Can I see the count?" Pierre again asked. \n\n"Hm If you wish to kill him, to kill him \n\noutright, you can see him . . . Olga, go and see \nwhether Uncle's beef tea is ready it is almost \ntime," she added, giving Pierre to understand \nthat they were busy, and busy making his fa- \nther comfortable, while evidently he, Pierre, \nwas only busy causing him annoyance. \n\nOlga went out. Pierre stood looking at the \nsisters; then he bowed and said: "Then I will \ngo to my rooms. You will let me know when I \ncan see him." \n\nAnd he left the room, followed by the low \nbut ringing laughter of the sister with the mole. \n\nNext day Prince Vasili had arrived and set- \ntled in the count's house. He sent for Pierre \nand said to him: "My dear fellow, if you are \ngoing to behave here as you did in Petersburg, \nyou will end very badly; that is all I have to say \nto you. The count is very, very ill, and you \nmust not see him at all." \n\nSince then Pierre had not been disturbed \n\n\n\nand had spent the whole time in his rooms up- \nstairs. c \n\nWhen Boris appeared at his door Pierre was \npacing up and down his room, stopping occa- \nsionally at a corner to make menacing gestures \nat the wall, as if running a sword through an \ninvisible foe, and glaring savagely over his \nspectacles, and then again resuming his walk, \nmuttering indistinct words, shrugging his \nshoulders and gesticulating. \n\n"England is done for," said he, scowling and \npointing his finger at someone unseen. "Mr. \nPitt, as a traitor to the nation and to the rights \nof man, is sentenced to . . ." But before Pierre \nwho at that moment imagined himself to be \nNapoleon in person and to have just effected \nthe dangerous crossing of the Straits of Dover \nand captured London could pronounce Pitt's \nsentence, he saw a well-built and handsome \nyoung officer entering his room. Pierre paused. \nHe had left Moscow when Boris was a boy 01 \nfourteen, and had quite forgotten him, but in \nhis usual impulsive and hearty way he took \nBoris by the hand with a friendly smile. \n\n"Do you remember me?" asked Boris quietly \nwith a pleasant smile. "I have come with my \nmother to see the count, but it seems he is not \nwell." \n\n"Yes, it seems he is ill. People are always dis- \nturbing him," answered Pierre, trying to re- \nmember who this young man was. \n\nBoris felt that Pierre did not recognize him \nbut did not consider it necessary to introduce \nhimself, and without experiencing the least em- \nbarrassment looked Pierre straight in the face. \n\n"Count Rostov asks you to come to dinner \ntoday," said he, after a considerable pause which \nmade Pierre feel uncomfortable. \n\n"Ah, Count Rostov 1" exclaimed Pierre joy- \nfully. "Then you are his son, Ilyd?Only fancy,! \ndidn't know you at first. Do you remember how \nwe went to the Sparrow Hills with Madame \nJacquot? . . . It's such an age ..." \n\n"You are mistaken," said Boris deliberately, \nwith a bold and slightly sarcastic smile. "I am \nBoris, son of Princess Anna Mikh&amp;ylovna Dru- \nbetskdya. Rost6v, the father, is Ilya, and his \nson is Nicholas. I never knew any Madame Jac- \nquot." \n\nPierre shook his head and arms as if attacked \nby mosquitoes or bees. \n\n"Oh dear, what am I thinking about? I've \nmixed every thing up. One has so many relatives \nin Moscow I So you are Boris? Of course. Well, \nnow we know where we are. And what do you \nthink of the Boulogne expedition? The English \n\n\n\nBOOK ONE \n\n\n\nwill come off badly, you know, if Napoleon gets \nacross the Channel. I think the expedition is \nquite feasible. If only Villeneuve doesn't make \na mess of things!" \n\nBoris knew nothing about the Boulogne ex- \npedition; he did not read the papers and it was \nthe first time he had heard Villeneuve's name. \n\n"We here in Moscow are more occupied with \ndinner parties and scandal than with politics," \nsaid he in his quiet ironical tone. "I know noth- \ning about it and have not thought about it. \nMoscow is chiefly busy with gossip," he contin- \nued. "Just now they are talking about you and \nyour father." \n\nPierre smiled in his good-natured way as if \nafraid for his companion's sake that the latter \nmight say something he would afterwards re- \ngret. But Boris spoke distinctly, clearly, and dry- \nly, looking straight into Pierre's eyes. \n\n"Moscow has nothing else to do but gossip," \nBoris went on. "Everybody is wondering to \nwhom the count will leave his fortune, though \nhe may perhaps outlive us all, as I sincerely \nhope he will ..." \n\n"Yes, it is all very horrid," interrupted \nPierre, "very horrid." \n\nPierre was still afraid that this officer might \ninadvertently say something disconcerting to \nhimself. \n\n"And it must seem to you," said Boris flush- \ning slightly, but not changing his tone or atti- \ntude, "it must seem to you that everyone is try- \ning to get something out of the rich man?" \n\n"So it does," thought Pierre. \n\n"But I just wish to say, to avoid misunder- \nstandings, that you are quite mistaken if you \nreckon me or my mother among such people. \nWe are very poor, but for my own part at any \nrate, for the very reason that your father is rich, \nI don't regard myself as a relation of his, and \nneither I nor my mother would ever ask or take \nanything from him." \n\nFor a long time Pierre could not understand, \nbut when he did, he jumped up from the sofa, \nseized Boris under the el bow in his quick, clum- \nsy way, and, blushing far more than Boris, be- \ngan to speak with a feeling of mingled shame \nand vexation. \n\n"Well, this is strange! Do you suppose I ... \nwho could think? ... I know very well . . ." \n\nBut Boris again interrupted him. \n\n"I am glad I have spoken out fully. Perhaps \nyou did not like it? You must excuse me," said \nhe, putting Pierre at ease instead of being put \nat ease by him, "but I hope I have not offended \nyou. I always make it a rule to speak out. . . . \n\n\n\nWell, what answer am I to take? Will you come \nto dinner at the Rostrivs'?" \n\nAnd Boris, having apparently relieved him- \nself of an onerous duty and extricated himself \nfrom an awkward situation and placed another \nin it, became quite pleasant again. \n\n"No, but I say," said Pierre, calming down, \n"you are a wonderful fellowl What you have \njust said is good, very good. Of course you don't \nknow me. We have not met for such a long \ntime . . . not since we were children. You might \nthink that I ... I understand, quite understand. \nI could not have done it myself, I should not \nhave had the courage, but it's splendid. I am \nvery glad to have made your acquaintance. It's \nqueer," he added a f ter a pause, "that you should \nhave suspected me!" He began to laugh. "Well, \nwhat of it! I hope we'll get better acquainted," \nand he pressed Boris' hand. "Do you know, I \nhave not once been in to see the count. He has \n\nnot sent forme I am sorry for him as a man, \n\nbut what can one do?" \n\n"And so you think Napoleon will manage to \nget an army across?" asked Boris with a smile. \n\nPierre saw that Boris wished to change the \nsubject, and being of the same mind he began \nexplaining the advantages and disadvantages \nof the Boulogne expedition. \n\nA footman came in to summon Boris the \nprincess was going. Pierre, in order to make \nBoris' better acquaintance, promised to come \nto dinner, and warmly pressing his hand looked \naffectionately over his spectacles into Boris* \neyes. After he had gone Pierre continued pac- \ning up and down" the room for a long time, no \nlonger piercing an imaginary foe with his im- \naginary sword, but smiling at the remembrance \nof that pleasant, intelligent, and resoluteyoung \nman. \n\nJ As often happens in early youth, especially \nto one who leads a lonely life, he felt an unac- \ncountable tenderness for this young man and \nmade up his mind that they would be friends. \n\nPrince Vasili saw the princess off. She held a \nhandkerchief to her eyes and her face was tear- \nful. \n\n"It is dreadful, dreadful!" she was saying, \n"but cost me what it may I shall do my duty. I \nwill come and spend the night. He must not be \nleft like this. Every moment is precious. I can't \nthink why his nieces put it off. Perhaps God \nwill help me to find a way to prepare him I . . . \nAdieu, Prince! May God support you . . ." \n\n"Adieu, ma bonne/' answered Prince Vasili \nturning away from her. \n\n"Oh, he is in a dreadful state," said the moth- \n\n\n\n3 o WAR AND PEACE \n\ner to her son when they were in the carriage. \n"He hardly recognizes anybody." \n\n"I don't understand, Mamma what is his at- \ntitude to Pierre?" asked the son. \n\n"The will will show that, my dear; our fate \nalso depends on it." \n\n"But why do you expect that he will leave us \nanything?" \n\n"Ah, my dear! He is so rich, and we are so \npoor!" \n\n"Well, that is hardly a sufficient reason, \nMamma . . ." \n\n"Oh, Heaven! How ill he is!" exclaimed the \nmother. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII \n\nAFTER ANNA MIKHAYLOVNA had driven off with \nher son to visit Count Cyril Vladfmirovich Be- \nziikhov, Countess Rost6va sat for a long time \nall alone applying her handkerchief to her eyes. \nAt last she rang. \n\n"What is the matter with you, my dear?" she \nsaid crossly to the maid who kept her waiting \nsome minutes. "Don't you wish to serve me? \nThen I'll find you another place." \n\nThe countess was upset by her friend's sor- \nrow and humiliating poverty, and was there- \nfore out of sorts, a state of mind which with her \nalways found expression in calling her maid \n"my dear" and speaking to her with exaggerat- \ned politeness. \n\n"I am very sorry, ma'am," answered the maid. \n\n"Ask the count to come to me." \n\nThe count came waddling in to see his wife \nwith a rather guilty look as usual. \n\n"Well, little countess? What a saute of game \nau madere we are to have, my dear! I tasted it. \nThe thousand rubles I paid for Taras were not \nill-spent. He is worth it!" \n\nHe sat down by his wife, his elbows on his \nknees and his hands ruffling his gray hair. \n\n"What are your commands, little countess?" \n\n"You see, my dear . . . What's that mess?" \nshe said, pointing to his waistcoat. "It's the \nsaute, most likely," she added with a smile. \n"Well, you see, Count, I want some money." \n\nHer face became sad. \n\n"Oh, little countess!" . . . and the count be- \ngan bustling to get out his pocketbook. \n\n"I want a great deal, Count! I want five hun- \ndred rubles," and taking out her cambric hand- \nkerchief she began wiping her husband's waist- \ncoat. \n\n"Yes, immediately, immediately! Hey, who's \nthere?" he called out in a tone only used by \npersons who are certain that those they call \n\n\n\nwill rvsh to obey the summons. "Send Dmitri \nto me!" \n\nDmitri, a man of good family who had been \nbrought up in the count's house and now man- \naged all his affairs, stepped softly into the room. \n\n"This is what I want, my dear fellow," said \nthe count to the deferential young man who \nhad entered. "Bring me . . ." he reflected a mo- \nment, "yes, bring me seven hundred rubles, yes! \nBut mind, don't bring me such tattered and \ndirty notes as last time, but nice clean ones for \nthe countess." \n\n"Yes, Dmitri, clean ones, please," said the \ncountess, sighing deeply. \n\n"When would you like them, your excellen- \ncy?" asked Dmitri. "Allow me to inform you \n. . . But, don't be uneasy," he added, noticing \nthat the count was beginning to breathe heav- \nily and quickly which was always a sign of ap- \nproaching anger. "I was forgetting ... Do you \nwish it brought at once?" \n\n"Yes, yes; just so! Bring it. Give it to the \ncountess." \n\n"What a treasure that Dmftri is," added the \ncount with a smile when the young man had \ndeparted. "There is never any 'impossible' \nwith him. That's a thing I hate! Everything is \npossible." \n\n"Ah, money, Count, money! How much sor- \nrow it causes in the world," said the countess. \n"But I am in great need of this sum." \n\n"You, my little countess, are a notorious \nspendthrift," said the count, and having kissed \nhis wife's hand he went back to his study. \n\nWhen Anna Mikhaylovna returned from \nCount Bezukhov's the money, all in clean notes, \nwas lying ready under a handkerchief on the \ncountess' little table, and Anna Mikhaylovna \nnoticed that something was agitating her. \n\n"Well, my dear?" asked the countess. \n\n"Oh, what a terrible state he is in! One \nwould not know him, he is so ill! I was only \nthere a few moments and hardly said a \nword . . ." \n\n"Annette, for heaven's sake don't refuse me," \nthe countess began, with a blush that looked \nvery strange on her thin, dignified, elderly face, \nand she took the money from under the hand- \nkerchief. \n\nAnna Mikhaylovna instantly guessed her in- \ntention and stooped to be ready to embrace the \ncountess at the appropriate moment. \n\n"This is for Boris from me, for his outfit." \n\nAnna Mikhdylovna was already embracing \nher and weeping. The countess wept too. They \nwept because they were friends, and because \n\n\n\nBOOK ONE \n\n\n\nthey were kindhearted, and because t they \nfriends from childhood had to think about \nsuch a base thing as money, and because their \nyouth was over. . . . But those tears were pleas- \nant to them both. \n\nCHAPTER XVIII \n\nCOUNTESS ROSTOVA, with her daughters and a \nlarge number of guests, was already seated in \nthe drawing room. The count took the gentle- \nmen into his study and showed them his choice \ncollection of Turkish pipes. From time to time \nhe went out to ask: "Hasn't she come yet?" \nThey were expecting Mdrya Dmf trievna Akhro- \nsimova, known in society as le terrible dragon, \na lady distinguished not for wealth or rank, \nbut for common sense and frank plainness of \nspeech. Mdrya Dmitrievna was known to the \nImperial family as well as to all Moscow and \nPetersburg, and both cities wondered at her, \nlaughed privately at her rudenesses, and told \ngood stories about her, while none the less all \nwithout exception respected and feared her. \n\nIn the count's room, which was full of tobac- \nco smoke, they talked of the war that had been \nannounced in a manifesto, and about the re- \ncruiting. None of them had yet seen the man- \nifesto, but they all knew it had appeared. The \ncount sat on the sofa between two guests who \nwere smoking and talking. He neither smoked \nnor talked, but bending his head first to one \nside and then to the other watched the smok- \ners with evident pleasure and listened to the \nconversation of his two neighbors, whom he \negged on against each other. \n\nOne of them was a sallow, clean-shaven ci- \nvilian with a thin and wrinkled face, already \ngrowing old, though he was dressed like a most \nfashionable young man. He sat with his legs up \non the sofa as if quite at home and, having \nstuck an amber mouthpiece far into his mouth, \nwas inhaling the smoke spasmodically and \nscrewing up his eyes. This was an old bachelor, \nShinshfn, a cousin of the countess', a man with \n"a sharp tongue" as they said in Moscow soci- \nety. He seemed to be condescending to his com- \npanion* The latter, a fresh, rosy officer of the \nGuards, irreproachably washed, brushed, and \nbuttoned, held his pipe in the middle of his \nmouth and with red lips gently inhaled the \nsmoke, letting it escape from his handsome \nmouth in rings. This was Lieutenant Berg, an \nofficer in the Semenov regiment with whom \nBorfs was to travel to join the army, and about \nwhom Natdsha had teased her elder sister Ye* ra, \nspeaking of Berg as her "intended." The count \n\n\n\nsat between them and listened attentively. His \nfavorite occupation when not playing boston, \na card game he was very fond of, was that of \nlistener, especially when he succeeded in set- \nting two loquacious talkers at one another. \n\n"Well, then, old chap, mon tres honorable \nAlphonse Kdrlovich," said Shinshfn, laughing \nironically and mixing the most ordinary Rus- \nsian expressions with the choicest French \nphrases which was a peculiarity of his speech. \n"Vous comptez vous faire des rentes sur Vttat;* \nyou want to make something out of your com- \npany?" \n\n"No, Peter Nikoldevich; I only want to show \nthat in the cavalry the advantages are far less \nthan in the infantry. Just consider my own po- \nsition now, Peter Nikoldevich . . ." \n\nBerg always spoke quietly, politely, and with \ngreat precision. His conversation always re- \nlated entirely to himself; he would remain calm \nand silent when the talk related to any topic \nthat had no direct bearingon himself. He could \nremain silent for hours without being at all put \nout of countenance himself or making others \nuncomfortable, but as soon as the conversa- \ntion concerned himself he would begin to talk \ncircumstantially and with evident satisfaction. \n\n"Consider my position, Peter Nikoldevich. \nWere I in the cavalry I should get not more \nthan two hundred rubles every four months, \neven with the rank of lieutenant; but as it is I \nreceive two hundred and thirty," said he, look- \ning at Shinshfn and the count with a joyful, \npleasant smile, as if it were obvious to him that \nhis success must always be the chief desire of \neveryone else. \n\n"Besides that, Peter NikoMevich, by ex- \nchanging into the Guards I shall be in a more \nprominent position," continued Berg, "and \nvacancies occur much more frequently in the \nFoot Guards. Then just think what can be done \nwith two hundred and thirty rubles! I even \nmanage to put a little aside and to send some- \nthing to my father," he went on, emitting a \nsmoke ring. \n\n"La balance y est a A German knows how \n\nto skin a flint, as the proverb says," remarked \nShinshfn, moving his pipe to the other side of \nhis mouth and winking at the count. \n\nThe count burst out laughing. The other \nguests seeing that Shinshfn was talking came \nup to listen. Berg, oblivious of irony or indif- \nference, continued to explain how by exchang- \n\n1 You expect to make an income out of the gov- \nernment. \n1 So that squares matters. \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\ning into the Guards he had already gained a \nstep on his old comrades of the Cadet Corps; \nhow in wartime the company commander might \nget killed and he, as senior in the company, \nmight easily succeed to the post; how popular \nhe was with everyone in the regiment, and how \nsatisfied his father was with him. Berg evident- \nly enjoyed narrating all this, and did not seem \nto suspect that others, too, might have their \nown interests. But all he said was so prettily se- \ndate, and the naivete* of his youthful egotism \nwas so obvious, that he disarmed his hearers. \n\n"Well, my boy, you'll get along wherever you \ngo foot or horse that I'll warrant," said Shin- \nshin, patting him on the shoulder and taking \nhis feet off the sofa. \n\nBerg smiled joyously. The count, followed \nby his guests, went into the drawing room. \n\nIt was just the moment before a big dinner \nwhen the assembled guests, expecting the sum- \nmons to zakuska* avoid engaging in any long \nconversation but think it necessary to move \nabout and talk, in order to show that they are \nnot at all impatient for their food. The host \nand hostess look toward the door, and now and \nthen glance at one another, and the visitors try \nto guess from these glances who, or what, they \nare waiting for some important relation who \nhas not yet arrived, or a dish that is not yet \nready. \n\nPierre had come just at dinnertime and was \nsitting awkwardly in the middle of the drawing \nroom on the first chair he had come across, \nblocking the way for everyone. The countess \ntried to make him talk, but he went on naively \nlooking around through his spectacles as if in \nsearch of somebody and answered all her ques- \ntions in monosyllables. He was in the way and \nwas the only one who did not notice the fact. \nMost of the guests, knowing of the affair with \nthe bear, looked with curiosity at this big, stout, \nquiet man, wondering how such a clumsy, mod- \nest fellow could have played such a prank on a \npoliceman. \n\n"You have only lately arrived?" the countess \nasked him. \n\n"Out, madame" replied he, looking around \nhim. \n\n"You have not yet seen my husband?" \n\n"Non, madame." He smiled quite inappro- \npriately. \n\n"You have been in Paris recently, I believe? \nI suppose it's very interesting." \n\n"Very interesting." \n\n1 Hors d'oeuvres. \n\n\n\nThs countess exchanged glances with Anna \nMikhdylovna. The latter understood that she \nwas being asked to entertain this young man, \nand sitting down beside him she began to speak \nabout his father; but he answered her, as he had \nthe countess, only in monosyllables. The other \nguests were all conversing with one another. \n"The Razum6vskis . . . It was charming . . . You \nare very kind . . . Countess Aprdksina . . ." was \nheard on all sides. The countess rose and went \ninto the ballroom. \n\n"Mirya Dmitrievna?" came her voice from \nthere. \n\n"Herself," came the answer in a rough voice, \nand Mrya Dmitrievna entered the room. \n\nAll the unmarried ladies and even the mar- \nried ones except the very oldest rose. Mdrya \nDmitrievna paused at the door. Tall and stout, \nholding high her fifty-year-old head with its \ngray curls, she stood surveying the guests, and \nleisurely arranged her wide sleeves as if rolling \nthem up. Mdrya Dmitrievna always spoke in \nRussian. \n\n"Health and happiness to her whose name \nday we are keeping and to her children," she \nsaid, in her loud, full-toned voice which \ndrowned all others. "Well, you old sinner," she \nwent on, turning to the count who was kissing \nher hand, "you're feeling dull in Moscow, I \ndaresay? Nowhere to hunt with your dogs? But \nwhat is to be done, old man? Just see how these \nnestlings are growing up," and she pointed to \nthe girls. "You must look for husbands for them \nwhether you like it or not. . . ." \n\n"Well," said she, "how's my Cossack?" \n(Mdrya Dmitrievna always tailed Natdsha a \nCossack) and she stroked the child's arm as she \ncame up fearless and gay to kiss her hand. "I \nknow she's a scamp of a girl, but I like her." \n\nShe took a pair of pear-shaped ruby earrings \nfrom her huge reticule and, having given them \nto the rosy Natdsha, who beamed with the pleas- \nure of her saint's-day fete, turned away at once \nand addressed herself to Pierre. \n\n"Eh, eh, friendl Come here a bit," said she, \nassuming a soft high tone of voice. "Come here, \nmy friend . . ." and she ominously tucked up \nher sleeves still higher. Pierre approached, look- \ning at her in a childlike way through his spec- \ntacles. \n\n"Come nearer, come nearer, friendl I used to \nbe the only one to tell your father the truth \nwhen he was in favor, and in your case it's my \nevident duty." She paused. All were silent, ex- \npectant of what was to follow, for this was \nclearly only a prelude. \n\n\n\nBOOK ONE \n\n\n\n33 \n\n\n\n"A fine lad! My wordl A fine lad! . . . f His fa- \nther lies on his deathbed and he amuses him- \nself setting a policeman astride a bear! For \nshame, sir, for shame! It would be better if you \nwent to the war." \n\nShe turned away and gave her hand to the \ncount, who could hardly keep from laughing. \n\n"Well, I suppose it is time we were at table?" \nsaid Mdrya Dmftrievna. \n\nThe count went in first with Mdrya Dmftriev- \nna, the countess followed on the arm of a colo- \nnel of hussars, a man of importance to them be- \ncause Nicholas was to go with him to the regi- \nment; then came Anna Mikhdylovna with \nShinshfn. Berg gave his arm to Vcra. The smil- \ning Julie Karagina went in with Nicholas. Aft- \ner them other couples followed, filling the \nwhole dining hall, and last of all the children, \ntutors, and governesses followed singly. The \nfootmen began moving about, chairs scraped, \nthe band struck up in the gallery, and the guests \nsettled down in their places. Then the strains \nof the count's household band were replaced \nby the clatter of knives and forks, the voices of \nvisitors, and the soft steps of the footmen. At \none end of the table sat the countess with Mdrya \nDmitrievna on her right and Anna Mikhaylov- \nna on her left, the other lady visitors were far- \nther down. At the other end sat the count, with \nthe hussar colonel on his left and Shinshin and \nthe other male visitors on his right. Midway \ndown the long table on one side sat the grown- \nup young people: Ve"ra beside Berg, and Pierre \nbeside Boris; and on the other side the children, \ntutors, and governesses. From behind the crys- \ntal decanters and fruit vases the count kept \nglancing at his wife and her tall cap with its \nlight-blue ribbons, and busily filled his neigh- \nbors' glasses, not neglecting his own. The count- \ness in turn, without omitting her duties as host- \ness, threw significant glances from behind the \npineapples at her husband whose face and bald \nhead seemed by their redness to contrast more \nthan usual with his gray hair. At the ladies' end \nan even chatter of voices was heard all the \ntime, at the men's end the voices sounded loud- \ner and louder, especially that of the colonel of \nhussars who, growing more and more flushed, \nate and drank so much that the count held him \nup as a pattern to the other guests. Berg with \ntender smiles was saying toVe*ra that love is not \nan earthly but a heavenly feeling. Borfs was \ntellinghis new friend Pierre who the guests were \nand exchanging glances with Natdsha, who was \nsitting opposite. Pierre spoke little but exam- \nined the new faces, and ate a great deal. Of the \n\n\n\ntwo soups he chose turtle with savory patties \nand went on to the game without omitting a \nsingle dish or one of the wines. These latter \nthe butler thrust mysteriously forward, wrapped \nin a napkin, from behind the next man's \nshoulders and whispered: "Dry Madeira" . . . \n"Hungarian" ... or "Rhine wine" as the case \nmight be. Of the four crystal glasses engraved \nwith the count's monogram that stood before \nhis plate, Pierre held out one at random and \ndrank with en joyment, gazing with ever-increas- \ning amiability at the other guests. Natsha,who \nsat opposite, was looking at Borfs as girls of \nthirteen look at the boy they are in love with \nand have just kissed for the first time. Some- \ntimes that same look fell on Pierre, and that \nfunny lively little girl's look made him inclined \nto laugh without knowing why. \n\nNicholas sat at some distance from S6nya, be- \nside Jujie Karagina, to whom he was again talk- \ning with the same involuntary smile. S6nya \nwore a company smile but was evidently tor- \nmented by jealousy; now she turned pale, now \nblushed and strained every nerve to over- \nhear what Nicholas and Julie were saying to \none another. The governess kept look ing round \nuneasily as if preparing to resent any slight \nthat might be put upon the children. The Ger- \nman tutor was trying to remember all the dish- \nes, wines, and kinds of dessert, in order to send \na full description of the dinner to his people in \nGermany; and he felt greatly offended when \nthe butler with a bottle wrapped in a napkin \npassed him by. He frowned, trying to appear as \nif he did not want any of that wine, but was \nmortified because no one would understand \nthat it was not to quench his thirst or from \ngreediness that he wanted it, but simply from a \nconscientious desire for knowledge. \n\nCHAPTER XIX \n\nAT THE MEN'S end of the table the talk grew \nmore and more animated. The colonel told \nthem that the declaration of war had already \nappeared in Petersburg and that a copy, which \nhe had himself seen, had that day been for- \nwarded by courier to the commander in \nchief. \n\n"And why the deuce are we going to fight \nBonaparte?" remarked Shinshfn. "He has \nstopped Austria's cackle and I fear it will be \nour turn next." \n\nThe colonel was a stout, tall, plethoric Ger- \nman, evidently devoted to the service and pa- \ntriotically Russian. He resented Shinshfn's re- \nmark. \n\n\n\n34 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\n"It is for the reasson, my goot sir," said he, \nspeaking with a German accent, "for the reas- \nson zat ze Emperor knows zat. He declares in ze \nmanifessto zat he cannot fiew wiz indifference \nze danger vreatening Russia and zat ze safety \nand dignity of ze Empire as veil as ze sanctity \nof its alliances . . ." he spoke this last word with \nparticular emphasis as if in it lay the gist of the \nmatter. \n\nThen with the unerring official memory that \ncharacterized him he repeated from the open- \ning words of the manifesto: \n\n. . . and the wish, which constitutes the Em- \nperor's sole and absolute aim to establish peace \nin Europe on firm foundations has now de- \ncided him to despatch part of the army abroad \nand to create a new condition for the attain- \nment of that purpose. \n\n"Zat, my dear sir, is vy ..." he concluded, \ndrinking a tumbler of wine with digijity and \nlooking to the count for approval. \n\n"Connaissez-vous le proverbe: l 'Jerome, Je- \nrome, do not roam, but turn spindles at \nhome!'?" said Shinshfn, puckering his brows \nand smiling. "Cela nous convient a merveille* \nSuv6rov now he knew what he was about; yet \nthey beat him &amp; plate couture? and where are \nwe to find Suv6rovs now? Je vous demande un \npeu"' said he, continually changing from \nFrench to Russian. \n\n"Ve must vight to the last tr-r-op of our \nploodl" said the colonel, thumping the table; \n"and ve must tie for our Emperor, and zen all \nvill pe veil. And ve must discuss it as little as \npo-o-ossible" ... he dwelt particularly on the \nword possible . . . "as po-o-ossible," he ended, \nagain turning to the count. "Zat is how ve old \nhussars look at it, and zere's an end of it! And \nhow do you, a young man and a young hussar, \nhow do you judge of it?" he added, addressing \nNicholas, who when he heard that the war was \nbeing discussed had turned from his partner \nwith eyes and ears intent on the colonel. \n\n"I am quite of your opinion," replied Nicho- \nlas, flaming up, turning his plate round and \nmoving his wineglasses about with as much de- \ncision and desperation as though he were at \nthat moment facing some great danger. "J am \nconvinced that we Russians must die or con- \nquer," he concluded, conscious as were oth- \nersafter the words were uttered that his re- \nmarks were too enthusiastic and emphatic for \n\n1 Do you know the proverb ? \n\n1 That suits us down to the ground. \n\nHollow. \n\n* I just aak you that. \n\n\n\nthe occasion and were therefore awkward. \n\n"Wliat you said just now was splendid!" said \nhis partner Julie. \n\nSonya trembled all over and blushed to her \nears and behind them and down to her neck \nand shoulders while Nicholas was speaking. \n\nPierre listened to the colonel's speech and \nnodded approvingly. \n\n"That's fine," said he. \n\n"The young man's a real hussar!" shouted \nthe colonel, again thumping the table. \n\n"What are you making such a noise about \nover there?" Mdrya Dmftrievna's deep voice \nsuddenly inquired from the other end of the \ntable. "What are you thumping the table for?" \nshe demanded of the hussar, "and why are you \nexciting yourself? Do you think the French are \nhere?" \n\n"I am speaking ze truce," replied the hussar \nwith a smile. \n\n"It's all about the war," the count shouted \ndown the table. "You know my son's going, \nMdrya Dmftrievna? My son is going." \n\n"I have four sons in the army but still I don't \nfret. It is all in God's hands. You may die in \nyour bed or God may spare you in a battle," re- \nplied Mdrya Dmftrievna's deep voice, which \neasily carried the whole length of the table. \n\n"That's true!" \n\nOnce more the conversations concentrated, \nthe ladies' at the one end and the men's at the \nother. \n\n"You won't ask," Natasha's little brother was \nsaying; "I know you won't ask!" \n\n"I will," replied Nat&amp;sha. \n\nHer face suddenly flushed with reckless and \njoyous resolution. She half rose, by a glance in- \nviting Pierre, who sat opposite, to listen to what \nwas coming, and turning to her mother: \n\n"Mammal" rang out the clear contralto notes \nof Her childish voice, audible the whole length \nof the table. \n\n"What is it?" asked the countess, startled; \nbut seeing by her daughter's face that it was on- \nly mischief, she shook a finger at her sternly \nwith a threatening and forbidding movement \nof her head. \n\nThe conversation was hushed. \n\n"Mammal What sweets are we going to \nhave?" and Natasha's voice sounded still more \nfirm and resolute. \n\nThe countess tried to frown, but could not. \nMdrya Dmf trievna shook her fat finger. \n\n"Cossack!" she said threateningly. \n\nMost of the guests, uncertain how to regard \nthis sally, looked at the elders. \n\n\n\nBOOK ONE \n\n\n\n35 \n\n\n\n"You had better take care! "said thecountess. \n\n"Mamma! What sweets are we going to \nhave?" Natdsha again cried boldly, with saucy \ngaiety, confident that her prank would betaken \nin good part. \n\nS6nya and fat little Ptya doubled up with \nlaughter. \n\n"You see! I have asked," whispered Natisha \nto her little brother and to Pierre, glancing at \nhim again. \n\n"Ice pudding, but you won't get any," said \nMdrya Dmftrievna. \n\nNatasha saw there was nothing to be afraid \nof and so she braved even Mdrya Dmitrievna. \n\n"Mrya Dmitrievna! What kind of ice pud- \nding? I don't like ice cream." \n\n"Carrot ices." \n\n"No! What kind, Mdrya Dmftrievna? What \nkind?" she almost screamed; "I want to know!" \n\nMarya Dmftrievna and the countess burst \nout laughing, and all the guests joined in. Ev- \neryone laughed, not at Marya Dmitrievna's an- \nswer but at the incredible boldness and smart- \nness of this little girl who had dared to treat \nMarya Dmftrievna in this fashion. \n\nNatasha only desisted when she had been told \nthat there would be pineapple ice. Before the \nices, champagne was served round. The band \nagain struck up, the count and countess kissed, \nand the guests, leaving their seats, went up to \n"congratulate" the countess, and reached \nacross the table to clink glasses with the count, \nwith the children, and with one another. Again \nthe footmen rushed about, chairs scraped, and \nin the same order in which they had entered \nbut with redder faces, the guests returned to \nthe drawing room and to the count's study. \n\nCHAPTER XX \n\nTHE CARD TABLES were drawn out, sets made \nup for boston, and the count's visitors settled \nthemselves, some in the two drawing rooms, \nsome in the sitting room, some in the library. \n\nThe count, holding his cards fanwise, kept \nhimself with difficulty from dropping into his \nusual after-dinner nap, and laughed at every- \nthing. The young people, at the countess* in- \nstigation, gathered round the clavichord and \nharp. Julie by general request played first. Aft- \ner she had played a little air with variations on \nthe harp, she joined the other young ladies in \nbegging Natasha and Nicholas, who were noted \nfor their musical talent, to sing something. \nNatdsha, who wa% treated as though she were \ngrown up, was evidently very proud of this but \nat the same time felt shy. \n\n\n\n"What shall we sing?" she said. \n\n" 'The Brook,' " suggested Nicholas. \n\n"Well, then, let's be quick. Boris, come here," \nsaid Natisha. "But where is S6nya?" \n\nShe looked round and seeing that her friend \nwas not in the room ran to look for her. \n\nRunning into S6nya's room and not finding \nher there, Natdsha ran to the nursery, but S6n- \nyawas not there either. Natdsha concluded that \nshe must be on the chest in the passage. The \nchest in the passage was the place of mourning \nfor the younger female generation in the Ros- \ntov household. And there in fact was S6nya ly- \ning face downward on Nurse's dirty feather \nbed on the top of the chest, crumpling her gau- \nzy pink dress under her, hiding her face with \nher slender fingers, and sobbing so convulsively \nthat her bare little shoulders shook. Natasha's \nface, which had been so radiantly happy all \nthat saint's day, suddenly changed: her eyes be- \ncame fixed, and then a shiver passed down her \nbroad neck and the corners of her mouth \ndrooped. \n\n"S6nya! What is it? What is the matter? . . . \nOo . . . Oo . . . Oo ... 1" And Natasha's large \nmouth widened, making her look quite ugly, \nand she began to wail like a baby without know- \ning why, except that S6nya was crying. Sonya \ntried to lift her head to answer but could not, \nand hid her face still deeper in the bed. Nata- \nsha wept, sitting on the blue-striped feather \nbed and hugging her friend. With an effort \nS6nya sat up and began wiping her eyes and \nexplaining. \n\n"Nicholas is going away in a week's time, his \n. . . papers . . . have come ... he told me him- \nself . . . but still I should not cry," and she \nshowed a paper she held in her handwith the \nverses Nicholas had written, "still, I should not \ncry, but you can't ... no one can understand \n. . . what a soul he has!" \n\nAnd she began to cry again because he had \nsuch a noble soul. \n\n"It's all very well for you ... I am not envi- \nous ... I love you and Boris also," she went on, \ngaining a little strength; "he is nice . . . there \n\nare no difficulties in yourway But Nicholas \n\nis my cousin . . . one would have to ... the \nMetropolitan himself . . . and even then it can't \nbe done. And besides, if she tells Mamma" \n(S6nya looked upon the countess as her moth- \ner and called her so) "that I am spoiling \nNicholas* career and am heartless and ungrate- \nful, while truly . . . God is my witness," and \nshe made the sign of the cross, "I love her so \nmuch, and all of you, only V^ra . . . And what \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nfor? What have I done to her? I am so grateful \nto you that I would willingly sacrifice every- \nthing, only I have nothing " \n\nS6nya could not continue, and again hid her \nface in her hands and in the feather bed. Nata- \nsha began consoling her, but her face showed \nthat she understood all the gravity of her \nfriend's trouble. \n\n"S6nya," she suddenly exclaimed, as if she \nhad guessed the true reason of her friend's sor- \nrow, "I'm sure Ve'ra has said something to you \nsince dinner? Hasn't she?" \n\n"Yes, these verses Nicholas wrote himself and \nI copied some others, and she found them on \nmy table and said she'd show them to Mamma, \nand that I was ungrateful, and that Mamma \nwould never allow him to marry me, but that \nhe'll marry Julie. You see how he's been with \nher all day . . . Natasha, what have I done to \ndeserve it? ..." \n\nAnd again she began to sob, more bitterly \nthan before. Natasha lifted her up, hugged her, \nand, smiling through her tears, began comfort- \ning her. \n\n"Sonya, don't believe her, darling! Don't be- \nlieve her! Do you remember how we and Nich- \nolas, all three of us, talked in the sitting room \nafter supper? Why, we settled how everything \nwas to be. I don't quite remember how, but \ndon't you remember that it could all be ar- \nranged and how nice it all was? There's Uncle \nShinshfn's brother has married his first cousin. \nAnd we are only second cousins, you know. \nAnd Boris says it is quite possible. You know \nI have told him all about it. And he is so clever \nand so good!" said Natasha. "Don't you cry, \nSonya, dear love,darlingS6nya!" and she kissed \nher and laughed. "Wra's spiteful; never mind \nher! And all will come right and she won't say \nanything to Mamma. Nicholas will tell her \nhimself, and he doesn't care at all for Julie." \n\nNatasha kissed her on the hair. \n\nSonya sat up. The little kitten brightened, \nits eyes shone, and it seemed ready to lift its \ntail, jump down on its soft paws, and begin \nplaying with the ball of worsted as a kitten \nshould. \n\n"Do you think so? ... Really? Truly?" she \nsaid, quickly smoothing her frock and hair. \n\n"Really, truly!" answered Natdsha, pushing \nin a crisp lock that had strayed from under her \nfriend's plaits. \n\nBoth laughed. \n\n"Well, let's go and sing 'The Brook/ " \n\n"Come along!" \n\n"Do you know, that fat Pierre who sat op- \n\n\n\nposite me is so funny!" said Natdsha, stopping \nsuddenly. "I feel so happy!" \nAnd she set off at a run along the passage. \nS6nya, shaking off some down which clung \nto her and tucking away the verses in the bos- \nom of her dress close to her bony little chest, \nran after Natasha down the passage into the \nsitting room with flushed face and light, joy- \nous steps. At the visitors' request the young \npeople sang the quartette, "The Brook," with \nwhich everyone was delighted. Then Nicholas \nsang a song he had just learned: \n\nAt nighttime in the moon's fair glow \nHow sweet, as fancies wander free f \nTo feel that in this world there's one \nWho still is thinking but of thee! \n\nThat while her fingers touch the harp \nWafting sweet music o'er the lea, \n\nIt is for thee thus swells her heart, \nSighing its message out to thee. . . . \n\nA day or two, then bliss unspoilt, \nBut oh! till then I cannot live! . . . \n\nHe had not finished the last verse before the \nyoung people began to get ready to dance in \nthe large hall, and the sound of the feet and \nthe coughing of the musicians were heard from \nthe gallery. \n\nPierre was sitting in the drawing-room where \nShinshin had engaged him, as a man recently \nreturned from abroad, in a political conversa- \ntion in which several others joined but which \nbored Pierre. When the music began Natasha \ncame in and walking straight up to Pierre said, \nlaughing and blushing: \n\n"Mamma told me to ask you to join the \ndancers." \n\n"I am afraid of mixing the figures," Pierre \nreplied; "but if you will be my teacher . . ." \nAnd lowering his big arm he offered it to the \nslender little girl. \n\nWhile the couples were arranging themselves \nand the musicians tuning up, Pierre sat down \nwith his little partner. Natasha was perfectly \nhappy; she was dancing with a grown-up man, \nwho had been abroad. She was sitting in a con- \nspicuous place and talking to him likeagrown- \nup lady. She had a fan in her hand that one of \nthe ladies had given her to hold. Assuming \nquite the pose of a society woman (heaven \nknows when and where she had learned it) she \ntalked with her partner, fanning herself and \nsmiling over the fan. \n\n"Dear, dear! Just look at her!" exclaimed the \ncountess as she crossed the ballroom, pointing \nto Natasha. \n\n\n\nBOOK ONE \n\n\n\nNatasha blushed and laughed. \n"Well, really, Mamma! Why should you? \nWhat is there to be surprised at?" \n\nIn the midst of the third tcossaise there was \na clatter of chairs being pushed back in the \nsitting room where the count and Mdrya Dmi- \ntrievna had been playing cards with the major- \nity of the more distinguished and older visitors. \nThey now, stretching themselves after sitting \nso long, and replacing their purses and pocket- \nbooks, entered the ballroom. First came Mdrya \nDmitrievna and the count, both with merry \ncountenances. The count, with playful cere- \nmony somewhat in ballet style, offered his bent \narm to Marya Dmitrievna. He drew himself \nup, a smile of debonair gallantry lit up his \nface, and as soon as the last figure of the ecos- \nsaise was ended, he clapped his hands to the \nmusicians and shouted up to their gallery, ad- \ndressing the first violin: \n\n"Semen! Do you know the Daniel Cooper?" \n\nThis was the count's favorite dance, which \nhe had danced in his youth. (Strictly speak- \ning, Daniel Cooper was one figure of the \nanglaise.) \n\n"Look at Papa!" shouted Natasha to the \nwhole company, and quite forgetting that she \nwas dancing with a grown-up partner she bent \nher curly head to her knees and made the whole \nroom ring with her laughter. \n\nAnd indeed everybody in the room looked \nwith a smile of pleasure at the jovial old gen- \ntleman, who standing beside his tall and stout \npartner, Mrya Dmftrievna, curved his arms, \nbeat time, straightened his shoulders, turned \nout his toes, tapped gently with his foot, and, \nby a smile that broadened his round face more \nand more, prepared the onlookers for what \nwas to follow. As soon as the provocatively gay \nstrains of Daniel Cooper (somewhat resem- \nbling those of a merry peasant dance) began \nto sound, all the doorways of the ballroom \nwere suddenly filled by the domestic serfs the \nmen on one side and the women on the other \nwho with beaming faces had come to see their \nmaster making merry. \n\n"Just look at the masterl A regular eagle he \nis!" loudly remarked the nurse, as she stood in \none of the doorways. \n\nThe count danced well and knew it. But his \npartner could not and did not want to dance \nwell. Her enormous figure stood erect, her pow- \nerful arms hanging down (she had handed her \nreticule to the countess), and only her stern \nbut handsome face really joined in the dance. \n\n\n\n37 \n\n\n\nWhat was expressed by the whole of the count's \nplump figure, in Mdrya Dmitrievna found ex- \npression only in her more and more beaming \nface and quivering nose. But if the count, get- \nting more and more into die swingof it, charmed \nthe spectators by the unexpectedness of his \nadroit maneuvers and the agility with which he \ncapered about on his light feet, Mrya Dmi- \ntrievna produced no less impression by slight ex- \nertions the least effort to move her shoulders \nor bend her arms when turning, or stamp her \nfoot which everyone appreciated in view of \nher size and habitual severity. The dance grew \nlivelier and livelier. The other couples could \nnot attract a moment's attention to their own \nevolutions and did not even try to do so. All \nwere watching the count and Mdrya Dmi- \ntrievna. Natasha kept pulling everyone by \nsleeve or dress, urging them to "look at Papa!" \nthough as it was they never took their eyes off \nthe couple. In the intervals of the dance the \ncount, breathing deeply, waved and shouted to \nthe musicians to play faster. Faster, faster, and \nfaster; lightly, more lightly, and yet more light- \nly whirled the count, flying round Marya Dmi- \ntrievna, now on his toes, now on his heels; un- \ntil, turning his partner round to her seat, he \nexecuted the final pas, raising his soft foot back- \nwards, bowing his perspiring head, smiling and \nmaking a wide sweep with his arm, amid a \nthunder of applause and laughter led by Nata- \nsha. Both partners stood still, breathing heavily \nand wiping their faces with their cambric \nhandkerchiefs. \n\n"That's how we used to dance in our time, \nma chere" said the count. \n\n"That was a Daniel Cooper!" exclaimed \nMdrya Dmftrievna, tucking up her sleeves and \npuffing heavily. \n\nCHAPTER XXI \n\nWHILE in the Rost6vs' ballroom the sixth ang- \nlaise was being danced, to a tune in which the \nweary musicians blundered, and while tired \nfootmen and cooks were getting the supper, \nCount Beziikhov had a sixth stroke. The doc- \ntors pronounced recovery impossible. After a \nmute confession, communion was administered \nto the dying man, preparations made for the \nsacrament of unction, and in his house there \nwas the bustle and thrill of suspense usual at \nsuch moments. Outside the house, beyond the \ngates, a group of undertakers, who hid when- \never a carriage drove up, waited in expectation \nof an important order for an expensive funer- \nal. The Military Governor of Moscow, who \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nhad been assiduous in sending aides-de-camp \nto inquire after the count's health, came him- \nself that evening to bid a last farewell to the \ncelebrated grandee of Catherine's court, Count \nBezukhov. \n\nThe magnificent reception room was crowd- \ned. Everyone stood up respectfully when the \nMilitary Governor, having stayed about half \nan hour alone with the dying man, passed out, \nslightly acknowledging their bows and trying \nto escape as quickly as possible from the glances \nfixed on him by the doctors, clergy, and rela- \ntives of the family. Prince Vasfli, who had \ngrown thinner and paler during the last few \ndays, escorted him to the door, repeating some- \nthing to him several times in low tones. \n\nWhen the Military Governor had gone, \nPrince Vasfli sat down all alone on a chair in \nthe ballroom, crossing one leg high over the \nother, leaning his elbow on his knee and cover- \ning his face with his hand. After sitting so for a \nwhile he rose, and, looking about him with \nfrightened eyes, went with unusually hurried \nsteps down the long corridor leading to the \nback of the house, to the room of the eldest \nprincess. \n\nThose who were in the dimly lit reception \nroom spoke in nervous whispers, and, when- \never anyone went into or came from the dying \nman's room, grew silent and gazed with eyes \nfull of curiosity or expectancy at his door, \nwhich creaked slightly when opened. \n\n"The limits of human life . . . are fixed and \nmay not be o'erpassed," said an old priest to a \nlady who had taken a seat beside him and was \nlistening naively to his words. \n\n"I wonder, is it not too late to administer \nunction?" asked the lady, adding the priest's \nclerical title, as if she had no opinion of her \nown on the subject. \n\n"Ah, madam, it is a great sacrament," replied \nthe priest, passing his hand over the thin griz- \nzled strands of hair combed back across his \nbald head. \n\n"Who was that? The Military Governor him- \nself?" was being asked at the other side of the \nroom. "How young-looking he is!" \n\n"Yes, and he is over sixty. I hear the count \nno longer recognizes anyone. They wished to \nadminister the sacrament of unction." \n\n"I knew someone who received that sacra- \nment seven times." \n\nThe second princess had just come from the \nsickroom with her eyes red from weeping and \nsat down beside Dr. Lorrain, who was sitting \nin a graceful pose under a portrait of Cather- \n\n\n\nine, leaning his elbow on a table. \n\n"Beautiful," said the doctor in answer to a \nremark about the weather. "The weather is \nbeautiful, Princess; and besides, in Moscow \none feels as if one were in the country." \n\n"Yes, indeed," replied the princess with a \nsigh. "So he may have something to drink?" \n\nLorrain considered. \n\n"Has he taken his medicine?" \n\n"Yes." \n\nThe doctor glanced at his watch. \n\n"Take a glass of boiled water and put a \npinch of cream of tartar," and he indicated \nwith his delicate fingers what he meant by a \npinch. \n\n"Dere has neffer been a gase,"a German doc- \ntor was saying to an aide-de-camp, "dat one \nliffs after de sird sdroke." \n\n"Arid what a well-preserved man he was {"re- \nmarked the aide-de-camp. "And who will in- \nherit his wealth?" he added in a whisper. \n\n"It von't go begging," replied the German \nwith a smile. \n\nEveryone again looked toward the door, \nwhich creaked as the second princess went in \nwith the drink she had prepared according to \nLorrain's instructions. The German doctor \nwent up to Lorrain. \n\n"Do you think he can last till morning?" \nasked the German, addressing Lorrain in \nFrench which he pronounced badly. \n\nLorrain, pursing up his lips, waved a severe- \nly negative finger before his nose. \n\n"Tonight, not later," said he in a low voice, \nand he moved away with a decorous smile of \nself-satisfaction at being able clearly to under- \nstand and state the patient's condition. \n\nMeanwhile Prince Vasili had opened the \ndoor into the princess' room. \n\nIn this room it was almost dark; only two \ntiny lamps were burning before the icons and \nthere was a pleasant scent of flowers and burnt \npastilles. The room was crowded with small \npieces of furniture, whatnots, cupboards, and \nlittle tables. The quilt of a high, white feather \nbed was just visible behind a screen. A small \ndog began to bark. \n\n"Ah, is it you, cousin?" \n\nShe rose and smoothed her hair, which was \nas usual so extremely smooth that it seemed to \nbe made of one piece with her head and cov- \nered with varnish. \n\n"Has anything happened?" she asked. "I am \nso terrified." \n\n"No, there is no change. I only came to have \n\n\n\nBOOK ONE \n\n\n\n39 \n\n\n\na talk about business, Catiche," l muttered the \nprince, seating himself wearily on the chair she \nhad just vacated. "You have made the place \nwarm, I must say," he remarked. "Well, sit \ndown: let's have a talk." \n\n"I thought perhaps something had hap- \npened/' she said with her unchanging stonily \nsevere expression; and, sitting down opposite \nthe prince, she prepared to listen. \n\n"I wished to get a nap, mon cousin, but I \ncan't." \n\n"Well, my dear?" said Prince Vasili, taking \nher hand and bending it downwards as was his \nhabit. \n\nIt was plain that this "well?" referred to \nmuch that they both understood without nam- \ning. \n\nThe princess, who had a straight, rigid body, \nabnormally long for her legs, looked directly at \nPrince Vasfli with no sign of emotion in her \nprominent gray eyes. Then she shook her head \nand glanced up at the icons with a sigh. This \nmight have been taken as an expression of sor- \nrow and devotion, or of weariness and hope of \nresting before long. Prince Vasili understood \nit as an expression of weariness. \n\n"And I?" he said; "do you think it is easier \nfor me? I am as worn out as a post horse, but \nstill I must have a talk with you, Catiche, a \nvery serious talk." \n\nPrince Vasfli said no more and his cheeks be- \ngan to twitch nervously, now on one side, now \non the other, giving his face an unpleasant ex- \npression which was never to be seen on it in a \ndrawing room. His eyes too seemed strange; at \none moment they looked impudently sly and \nat the next glanced round in alarm. \n\nThe princess, holding her little dog on her \nlap with her thin bony hands, looked atten- \ntively into Prince Vasfli's eyes evidently re- \nsolved not to be the first to break silence, if she \nhad to wait till morning. \n\n"Well, you see, my dear princess and cousin, \nCatherine Semenovna," continued Prince Va- \nsfli, returning to his theme, apparently not \nwithout an inner struggle; "at such a moment \nas this one must think of everything. One must \nthink of the future, of all of you ... I love you \nall, like children of my own, as you know." \n\nThe princess continued to look at him with- \nout moving, and with the same dull expres- \nsion. \n\n"And then of course my family has also to be \nconsidered," Prince Vasili went on, testily \npushing away a little table without looking at \n\n1 Catherine. \n\n\n\nher. "You know, Catiche, that wg you three \nsisters, Mdmontov, and my wife are the count's \nonly direct heirs. I know, I know how hard it \nis for you to talk or think of such matters. It is \nno easier for me; but, my dear, I am getting on \nfor sixty and must be prepared for anything. \nDo you know I have sent for Pierre? The count," \npointing to his portrait, "definitely demanded \nthat he should be called." \n\nPrince Vasfli looked questioningly at the \nprincess, but could not make out whether she \nwas considering what he had just said or wheth- \ner she was simply looking at him. \n\n"There is one thing I constantly pray God \nto grant, mon cousin/' she replied, "and it is \nthat He would be merciful to him and would \nallow his noble soul peacefully to leave this. . ." \n\n"Yes, yes, of course," interrupted Prince Va- \nsili impatiently, rubbing his bald head and an- \ngrily pulling back toward him the little table \nthat he had pushed away. "But ... in short, \nthe fact is ... you know yourself that last win- \nter the count made a will by which he left all \nhis property, not to us his direct heirs, but to \nPierre." \n\n"He has made wills enoughl" quietly re- \nmarked the princess. "But he cannot leave the \nestate to Pierre. Pierre is illegitimate." \n\n"But, my dear," said Prince Vasfli suddenly, \nclutching the little table and becoming more \nanimated and talking more rapidly: "what if \na letter has been written to the Emperor in \nwhich the count asks for Pierre's legitimation? \nDo you understand that in consideration of \nthe count's services, his request would be \ngranted? . . ." \n\nThe princess smiled as people do who think \nthey know more about the subject under dis- \ncussion than those they are talking with. \n\n"I can tell you more," continued Prince Va- \nsfli, seizing her hand, "that letter was written, \nthough it was not sent, and the Emperor knew \nof it. The only question is, has it been de- \nstroyed or not? If not, then as soon as all is \nover/' and Prince Vasfli sighed to intimate \nwhat he meant by the words all is over, "and \nthe count's papers are opened, the will and \nletter will be delivered to the Emperor, and \nthe petition will certainly be granted. Pierre \nwill get everything as the legitimate son." \n\n"And our share?" asked the princess smiling \nironically, as if anything might happen, only \nnot that. \n\n"But, my poor Catiche, it is as clear as day- \nlightl He will then be the legal heir to every- \nthing and you won't get anything. You must \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nknow, my dear, whether the will and letter \nwere written, and whether they have been de- \nstroyed or not. And if they have somehow been \noverlooked, you ought to know where they are, \nand must find them, because . . ." \n\n"What next?" the princess interrupted, smil- \ning sardonically and not changing the expres- \nsion of her eyes. "I am a woman, and you think \nwe are all stupid; but I know this: an illegiti- \nmate son cannot inherit . . . un bdtard!" * she \nadded, as if supposing that this translation of \nthe word would effectively prove to Prince Va- \nsfli the invalidity of his contention. \n\n"Well, really, Catiche! Can't you under- \nstand! You are so intelligent, how is it you don't \nsee that if the count has written a letter to the \nEmperor begging him to recognize Pierre as \nlegitimate, it follows that Pierre will not be \nPierre but will become Count Bezukhov, and \nwill then inherit everything under the will? \nAnd if the will and letter are not destroyed, \nthen you will have nothing but the consola- \ntion of having been dutiful et tout ce qui s* en- \nsuit! * That's certain." \n\n"I know the will was made, but I also know \nthat it is invalid; and you, mon cousin, seem to \nconsider me a perfect fool," said the princess \nwith the expression women assume when they \nsuppose they are saying something witty and \nstinging. \n\n"My dear Princess Catherine Semenovna," \nbegan Prince Vasfli impatiently, "I came here \nnot to wrangle with you, but to talk about \nyour interests as with a kinswoman, a good, \nkind, true relation. And I tell you for the tenth \ntime that if the letter to the Emperor and the \nwill in Pierre's favor are among the count's \npapers, then, my dear girl, you and your sisters \nare not heiressesl If you don't believe me, then \nbelieve an expert. I have just been talking to \nDmitri Oniifrich" (the family solicitor) "and \nhe says the same." \n\nAt this a sudden change evidently took place \nin the princess' ideas; her thin lips grew white, \nthough her eyes did not change, and her voice \nwhen she began to speak passed through such \ntransitions as she herself evidently did not ex- \npect. \n\n"That would be a fine thing!" said she. "I \nnever wanted anything and I don't now." \n\nShe pushed the little dog off her lap and \nsmoothed her dress. \n\n"And this is gratitudethis is recognition for \nthose who have sacrificed everything for his \n\n1 A bastard. \n\n* And all that follows therefrom. \n\n\n\nsake!" she cried. "It's splendid! Fine! I don't \nwant anything, Prince." \n\n"Yes, but you are not the only one. There \nare your sisters . . ." replied Prince Vasfli. \n\nBut the princess did not listen to him. \n\n"Yes, I knew it long ago but had forgotten. \nI knew that I could expect nothing but mean- \nness, deceit, envy, intrigue, and ingratitude \nthe blackest ingratitude in this house . . ." \n\n"Do you or do you not know where that will \nis?" insisted Prince Vasfli, his cheeks twitching \nmore than ever. \n\n"Yes, I was a fool! I still believed in people, \nloved them, and sacrificed myself. But only the \nbase, the vile succeed! I know who has been in- \ntriguing!" \n\nThe princess wished to rise, but the prince \nheld her by the hand. She had the air of one \nwho has suddenly lost faith in the whole hu- \nman race. She gave her companion an angry \nglance. \n\n"There is still time, my dear. You must re- \nmember, Catiche, that it was all done casually \nin a moment of anger, of illness, and was after- \nwards forgotten. Our duty, my dear, is to recti- \nfy his mistake, to ease his last moments by not \nletting him commit this injustice, and not to \nlet him die feeling that he is rendering un- \nhappy those who ..." \n\n"Who sacrificed everything for him," chimed \nin the princess, who would again have risen \nhad not the prince still held her fast, "though \nhe never could appreciate it. No, mon cousin/' \nshe added with a sigh, "I shall always remem- \nber that in this world one must expect no re- \nward, that in this world there is neither honor \nnor justice. In this world one has to be cun- \nning and cruel." \n\n"Now come, come! Be reasonable. I know \nyour excellent heart." \n\n"No, I have a wicked heart." \n\n"I know your heart," repeated the prince. "I \nvalue your friendship and wish you to have as \ngood an opinion of me. Don't upset yourself, \nand let us talk sensibly while there is still time, \n\nbe it a day or be it but an hour Tell me all \n\nyou know about the will, and above all where \nit is. You must know. We will take it at once \nand show it to the count. He has, no doubt, for- \ngotten it and will wish to destroy it. You un- \nderstand that my sole desire is conscientiously \nto carry out his wishes; that is my only reason \nfor being here. I came simply to help him and \nyou." \n\n"Now I see it all! I know who has been in- \ntriguingI know!" cried the princess. \n\n\n\nBOOK ONE \n\n\n\n"That's not the point, my dear." \n"It's that protg of yours, that sweet Prin- \ncess Drubetskaya, that Anna Mikhaylovna \nwhom I would not take for a housemaid . . . \nthe infamous, vile woman 1" \n\n"Do not let us lose any time . . ." \n"Ah, don't talk to me! Last winter she whee- \ndled herself in here and told the count such \nvile, disgraceful things about us, especially a- \nbout Sophie I can't repeat them that it made \nthe count quite ill and he would not see us for \na whole fortnight. I know it was then he wrote \nthis vile, infamous paper, but I thought the \nthing was invalid." \n\n"We've got to it at last why did you not tell \nme about it sooner?" \n\n"It's in the inlaid portfolio that he keeps un- \nder his pillow," said the princess, ignoring his \nquestion. "Now I know! Yes; if I have a sin, a \ngreat sin, it is hatred of that vile woman!" al- \nmost shrieked the princess, now quite changed. \n"And what docs she come worming herself in \nhere for? But I will give her a piece of my \nmind. The time will come!" \n\nCHAPTER XXII \n\nWHILE these conversations were going on in \nthe reception room and the princess' room, a \ncarriage containing Pierre (who had been sent \nfor) and Anna Mikhaylovna (who found it nec- \nessary to accompany him) was driving into the \ncourt of Count Beziikhov's house. As the wheels \nrolled softly over the straw beneath the win- \ndows, Anna Mikhdylovna, having turned with \nwords of comfort to her companion, realized \nthat he was asleep in his corner and woke him \nup. Rousing himself, Pierre followed Anna \nMikhaylovna out of the carriage, and only then \nbegan to think of the interview with his dying \nfather which awaited him. He noticed that \nthey had not come to the front entrance but to \nthe backdoor. While he was getting down from \nthe carriage steps two men, who looked like \ntradespeople, ran hurriedly from the entrance \nand hid in the shadow of the wall. Pausing for \na moment, Pierre noticed several other men of \nthe same kind hiding in the shadow of the \nhouse on both sides. But neither Anna Mik- \nhaylovna nor the footman nor the coachman, \nwho could not help seeing these people, took \nany notice of them. "It seems to be all right," \nPierre concluded, and followed Anna Mikhay- \nlovna. She hurriedly ascended the narrow dim- \nly lit stone staircase, calling to Pierre, who was \nlagging behind, to follow. Though he did not \nsee why it was necessary for him to go to the \n\n\n\ncount at all, still less why he had to go by the \nback stairs, yet judging byAnnaMikhiylovna's \nair of assurance and haste, Pierre concluded \nthat it was all absolutely necessary. Halfway \nup the stairs they were almost knocked over by \nsome men who, carrying pails, came running \ndownstairs, their boots clattering. These men \npressed close to the wall to let Pierre andAnna \nMikMylovna pass and did not evince the least \nsurprise at seeing them there. \n\n"Is this the way to the princesses' apart- \nments?" asked Anna Mikhaylovna of one of \nthem. \n\n"Yes, "replied a footman in a bold loud voice, \nas if anything were now permissible; "the door \nto the left, ma'am." \n\n"Perhaps the count did not ask for me," said \nPierre when he reached the landing. "I'd bet- \nter go to my own room." \n\nAnna Mikhaylovna paused and waited for \nhim to come up. \n\n"Ah, my friend!" she said, touching his arm \nas she had done her son's when speaking to \nhim that afternoon, "believe me I suffer no \nless than you do, but be a man!" \n\n"But really, hadn't I better go away?" he \nasked, looking kindly at her over his spectacles. \n\n"Ah, my dear friend! Forget the wrongs that \nmay have been done you. Think that he is your \nfather . . . perhaps in the agony of death." She \nsighed. "I have loved you like a son from the \nfirst. Trust yourself to me, Pierre. I shall not \nforget your interests." \n\nPierre did not understand a word, but the \nconviction that all this had to be grew stronger, \nand he meekly followed Anna Mikhaylovna \nwho was already opening a door. \n\nThis door led into a back anteroom. An old \nman, a servant of the princesses, sat in a corner \nknitting a stocking. Pierre had never been in \nthis part of the house and did not even know \nof the existence of these rooms. Anna Mikhay- \nlovna, addressing a maid who was hurrying \npast with a decanter on a tray as "my dear" and \n"my sweet," asked about the princesses' health \nand then led Pierre along a stone passage. The \nfirst door on the left led into the princesses' \napartments. The maid with the decanter in \nher haste had not closed the door (everything \nin the house was done in haste at that time), \nand Pierre and Anna Mikhdylovna in passing \ninstinctively glanced into the room, where \nPrince Vasili and the eldest princess were sit- \nting close together talking. Seeing them pass, \nPrince Vasili drew back with obvious impa- \ntience, while the princess jumped up and with \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\na gesture of desperation slammed the door with \nall her might. \n\nThis action was so unlike her usual compo- \nsure and the fear depicted on Prince Vasili's \nface so out of keeping with his dignity that \nPierre stopped and glanced inquiringly over \nhis spectacles at his guide. Anna Mikhdylovna \nevinced no surprise, she only smiled faintly \nand sighed, as if to say that this was no more \nthan she had expected. \n\n"Be a man, my friend. I will look after your \ninterests," said she in reply to his look, and \nwent still faster along the passage. \n\nPierre could not make out what it was all \nabout, and still less what "watching over his \ninterests" meant, but he decided that all these \nthings had to be. From the passage they went \ninto a large, dimly lit room adjoining the count's \nreception room. It was one of those sumptuous \nbut cold apartments known to Pierre only from \nthe front approach, but even in this room there \nnow stood an empty bath, and water had been \nspilled on the carpet. They were met by a dea- \ncon with a censer and by a servant who passed \nout on tiptoe without heeding them. They \nwent into the reception room familiar to \nPierre, with two Italian windows opening in- \nto the conservatory, with its large bust and full- \nlength portrait of Catherine the Great. The \nsame people were still sitting here in almost \nthe same positions as before, whispering to one \nanother. All became silent and turned to look \nat the pale tear-worn Anna Mikhylovna as she \nentered, and at the big stout figure of Pierre \nwho, hanging his head, meekly followed her. \n\nAnna Mikhdylovna's face expressed a con- \nsciousness that the decisive moment had ar- \nrived. With the air of a practical Petersburg \nlady she now, keeping Pierre close beside her, \nentered the room even more boldly than that \nafternoon. She felt that as she brought with her \nthe person the dying man wished to see, her \nown admission was assured. Casting a rapid \nglance at all those in the room and noticing \nthe count's confessor there, she glided up to \nhim with a sort of amble, not exactly bowing, \nyet seeming to grow suddenly smaller, and re- \nspectfully received the blessing first of one and \nthen of another priest. \n\n"God be thanked that you are in time," said \nshe to one of the priests; "all we relatives have \nbeen in such anxiety. This young man is the \ncount's son," she added more softly. "What a \nterrible moment!" \n\nHaving said this she went up to the doctor. \n\n"Dear doctor," said she, "this young man is \n\n\n\nthe count's son. Is there any hope?" \n\nThe doctor cast a rapid glance upwards and \nsilently shrugged his shoulders. Anna Mikhiy- \nlovna with just the same movement raised her \nshoulders and eyes, almost closing the latter, \nsighed, and moved away from the doctor to \nPierre. To him, in a particularly respectful and \ntenderly sad voice, she said: \n\n"Trust in His mercy!" and pointing out a \nsmall sofa for him to sit and wait for her, she \nwent silently toward the door that everyone \nwas watching and it creaked very slightly as \nshe disappeared behind it. \n\nPierre, having made up his mind to obey his \nmonitress implicitly, moved toward the sofa \nshe had indicated. As soon as Anna Mikhdy- \nlovna had disappeared he noticed that the eyes \nof all in the room turned to him with some- \nthing more than curiosity and sympathy. He \nnoticed that they whispered to one another, \ncasting significant looks at him with a kind of \nawe and even servility. A deference such as he \nhad never before received vas shown him. A \nstrange lady, the one who had been talking to \nthe priests, rose and offered him her seat; an \naide-de-camp picked up and returned a glove \nPierre had dropped; the doctors became re- \nspectfully silent as he passed by, and moved to \nmake way for him. At first Pierre wished to \ntake another seat so as not to trouble the lady, \nand also to pick up the glove himself and to \npass round the doctors who were not even in \nhis way; but all at once he felt that this would \nnot do, and that tonight he was a person o- \nbliged to perform some sort of awful rite which \neveryone expected of him, and that he was \ntherefore bound to accept their services. He \ntook the glove in silence from the aide-de-camp, \nand sat down in the lady's chair, placing his \nhuge hands symmetrically on his knees in the \nnai've attitude of an Egyptian statue, and de- \ncided in his own mind that all was as it should \nbe, and that in order not to lose his head and \ndo foolish things he must not act on his own \nideas tonight, but must yield himself up entire- \nly to the will of those who were guiding him. \n\nNot two minutes had passed before Prince \nVasili with head erect majestically entered the \nroom. He was wearing his long coat with three \nstars on his breast. He seemed to have grown \nthinner since the morning; his eyes seemed \nlarger than usual when he glanced round and \nnoticed Pierre. He went up to him, took his \nhand (a thing he never used to do), and drew \nit downwards as if wishing to ascertain wheth- \ner it was firmly fixed on. \n\n\n\nBOOK ONE \n\n\n\n43 \n\n\n\n"Courage, courage, my friend! He has^sked \nto see you. That is well!" and he turned to go. \n\nBut Pierre thought it necessary to ask: "How \nis . . ." and hesitated, not knowing whether it \nwould be proper to call the dying man "the \ncount," yet ashamed to call him "father." \n\n"He had another stroke about half an hour \nago. Courage, my friend . . ." \n\nPierre's mind was in such a confused state \nthat the word "stroke" suggested to him a blow \nfrom something. He looked at Prince Vasfli in \nperplexity, and only later grasped that a stroke \nwas an attack of illness. Prince Vastti said some- \nthing to Lorrain in passing and went through \nthe door on tiptoe. He could not walk well on \ntiptoe and his whole body jerked at each step. \nThe eldest princess followed him, and the \npriests and deacons and some servants also \nwent in at the door. Through that door was \nheard a noise of things being moved about, and \nat last Anna Mikhaylovna, still with the same \nexpression, pale but resolute in the discharge \nof duty, ran out and touching Pierre lightly on \nthe arm said: \n\n"The divine mercy is inexhaustible! Unc- \ntion is about to be administered. Come." \n\nPierre went in at the door, stepping on the \nsoft carpet, and noticed that the strange lady, \nthe aide-de-camp, and some of the servants, all \nfollowed him in, as if there were now no fur- \nther need for permission to enter that room. \n\nCHAPTER XXIII \n\nPIERRE well knew this large room divided by \ncolumns and an arch, its walls hung round with \nPersian carpets. The part of the room behind \nthe columns, with a high silk-curtained mahog- \nany bedstead on one side and on the other an \nimmense case containing icons, was brightly \nilluminated with red light like a Russian church \nduring evening service. Under the gleaming \nicons stood a long invalid chair, and in that \nchair on snowy-white smooth pillows, evident- \nly freshly changed, Pierre saw covered to the \nwaist by a bright green quiltthe familiar, ma- \njestic figure of his father, Count Beziikhov, \nwith that gray mane of hair above his broad \nforehead which reminded one of a lion, and \nthe deep characteristically noble wrinkles of \nhis handsome, ruddy face. He lay just under \nthe icons; his large thick hands outside the \nquilt. Into the right hand, which was lying \npalm downwards, a wax taper had been thrust \nbetween forefinger and thumb, and an old serv- \nant, bending over from behind the chair, held \nit in position. By the chair stood the priests, \n\n\n\ntheir long hair falling over their magnificent \nglittering vestments, with lighted tapers in their \nhands, slowly and solemnly conducting the \nservice. A little behind them stood the two \nyounger princesses holding handkerchiefs to \ntheir eyes, and just in front of them their eld- \nest sister, Catiche, with a vicious and deter- \nmined look steadily fixed on the icons, as though \ndeclaring to all that she could not answer for \nherself should she glance round. Anna Mikhdy- \nlovna,witha meek, sorrowful, and all-forgiving \nexpression on her face, stood by the door near \nthe strange lady. Prince Vasili in front of the \ndoor, near the invalid chair, a wax taper in his \nleft hand, was leaning his left arm on the \ncarved back of a velvet chair he had turned \nround for the purpose, and was crossing him- \nself with his right hand, turning his eyes up- \nward each time he touched his forehead. His \nface wore a calm look of piety and resignation \nto the will of God. "If you do not understand \nthese sentiments," he seemed to be saying, "so \nmuch the worse for you!" \n\nBehind him stood the aide-de-camp, the doc- \ntors, and the menservants; the men and wom- \nen had separated as in church. All were silently \ncrossing themselves, and the reading of the \nchurch service, the subdued chanting of deep \nbass voices, and in the intervals sighs and the \nshuffling of feet were the only sounds that could \nbe heard. Anna Mikhaylovna, with an air of \nimportance that showed that she felt she quite \nknew what she was about, went across the room \nto where Pierre was standing and gave him a \ntaper. He lit it and, distracted by observing \nthose around him, began crossing himself with \nthe hand that held the taper. \n\nSophie, the rosy, laughter-loving, youngest \nprincess with the mole, watched him. She \nsmiled, hid her face in her handkerchief, and \nremained with it hidden for awhile; then look- \ning up and seeing Pierre she again began to \nlaugh. She evidently felt unable to look at him \nwithout laughing, but could not resist looking \nat him: so to be out of temptation she slipped \nquietly behind one of the columns. In the midst \nof the service the voices of the priests suddenly \nceased, they whispered to one another, and the \nold servant who was holding the count's hand \ngot up and said something to the ladies. Anna \nMikhaylovna stepped forward and, stooping o- \nver the dying man, beckoned to Lorrain from \nbehind her back. The French doctor held no ta- \nper; he was leaning against one of the columns \nin a respectful attitude implying that he, a \nforeigner, in spite of all differences of faith, \n\n\n\n44 \n\n\n\nunderstood the full importance of the rite now \nbeing performed and even approved of it. He \nnow approached the sick man with the noise- \nless step of one in full vigor of life, with his \ndelicate white fingers raised from the green \nquilt the hand that was free, and turning side- \nways felt the pulse and reflected a moment. The \nsick man was given something to drink, there \nwas a stir around him, then the people resumed \ntheir places and the service continued. During \nthis interval Pierre noticed that Prince Vasili \nleft the chair on which he had been leaning, \nand with an air which intimated that he knew \nwhat he was about and if others did not under- \nstand him it was so much the worse for them \ndid not go up to the dying man, but passed \nby him, joined the eldest princess, and moved \nwith her to the side of the room where stood \nthe high bedstead with its silken hangings. On \nleaving the bed both Prince Vasili and the \nprincess passed out by a back door, but returned \nto their places one after the other before the \nservice was concluded. Pierre paid no more at- \ntention to thjs occurrence than to the rest of \nwhat went on, having made up his mind once \nfor all that what he saw happening around him \nthat evening was in some way essential. \n\nThe chanting of the service ceased, and the \nvoice of the priest was heard respectfully con- \ngratulating the dying man on having received \nthe sacrament. The dying man lay as lifeless \nand immovable as before. Around him every- \none began to stir: steps were audible and whis- \npers, among which Anna Mikhaylovna's was \nthe most distinct. \n\nPierre heard her say: \n\n"Certainly he must be moved onto the bed; \nhere it will be impossible . . ." \n\nThe sick man was so surrounded by doctors, \nprincesses, and servants that Pierre could no \nlonger see the reddish-yellow face with its gray \nmane which, though he saw other faces as well, \nhe had not lost sight of for a single moment \nduring the whole service. He judged by the \ncautious movements of those who crowded \nround the invalid chair that they had lifted the \ndying man and were moving him. \n\n"Catch hold of my arm or you'll drop him!" \nhe heard one of the servants say in a frightened \nwhisper. "Catch hold from underneath. Here!" \nexclaimed different voices; and the heavy \nbreathing of the bearers and the shuffling of \ntheir feet grew more hurried, as if the weight \nthey were carrying were too much for them. \n\nAs the bearers, among whom was Anna Mik- \nhaylovna, passed the young man he caught a \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\nmomentary glimpse between their heads and \nbacks of the dying man's high, stout, uncovered \nchest and powerful shoulders, raised by those \nwho were holding him under the armpits, and \nof his gray, curly, leonine head. This head, with \nits remarkably broad brow and cheekbones, its \nhandsome, sensual mouth, and its cold, majes- \ntic expression, was not disfigured by the ap- \nproach of death. It was the same as Pierre re- \nmembered it three months before, when the \ncount had sent him to Petersburg. But now this \nhead was swaying helplessly with the uneven \nmovements of the bearers, and the cold listless \ngaze fixed itself upon nothing. \n\nAfter a few minutes' bustle beside the high \nbedstead, those who had carried the sick man \ndispersed. Anna Mikhaylovna touched Pierre's \nhand and said, "Come." Pierre went with her \nto the bed on which the sick man had been laid \nin a stately pose in keeping with the ceremony \njust completed. He lay with his head propped \nhigh on the pillows. His hands were symmetri- \ncally placed on the green silk quilt, the palms \ndownward. When Pierre came up the count \nwas gazing straight at him, but with a look the \nsignificance of which could not be understood \nby mortal man. Either this look meant nothing \nbut that as long as one has eyes they must look \nsomewhere, or it meant too much. Pierre hesi- \ntated, not knowing what to do, and glanced in- \nquiringly at his guide. Anna Mikhdylovna \nmade a hurried sign with her eyes, glancing at \nthe sick man's hand and moving her lips as if \nto send it a kiss. Pierre, carefully stretching his \nneck so as not to touch the quilt, followed \nher suggestion and pressed his lips to the large- \nboned, fleshy hand. Neither the hand nor a \nsingle muscle of the count's face stirred. Once \nmore Pierre looked questioningly at Anna \nMikhaylovna to see what he was to do next. \nAnna Mikhaylovna with her eyes indicated a \nchair that stood beside the bed. Pierre obedi- \nently sat down, his eyes asking if he were doing \nright. Anna Mikhaylovna nodded approving- \nly. Again Pierre fell into the naively symmetri- \ncal pose of an Egyptian statue, evidently dis- \ntressed that his stout and clumsy body took up \nso much room and doing his utmost to look as \nsmall as possible. He looked at the count, who \nstill gazed at the spot where Pierre's face had \nbeen before he sat down. Anna Mikhaylovna \nindicated by her attitude her consciousness of \nthe pathetic importance of these last moments \nof meeting between the father and son. This \nlasted about two minutes, which to Pierre \nseemed an hour. Suddenly the broad muscles \n\n\n\nBOOK ONE \n\n\n\n45 \n\n\n\nand lines of the count's face began to twitch. \nThe twitching increased, the handsome skouth \nwas drawn to one side (only now did Pierre \nrealize how near death his father was), and \nfrom that distorted mouth issued an indistinct, \nhoarse sound. Anna Mikhaylovna looked at- \ntentively at the sick man's eyes, trying to guess \nwhat he wanted; she pointed first to Pierre, then \nto some drink, then named Prince Vasfli in an \ninquiring whisper, then pointed to the quilt. \nThe eyes and face of the sick man showed im- \npatience. He made an effort to look at the serv- \nant who stood constantly at the head of the \nbed. \n\n"Wants to turn on the other side," whis- \npered the servant, and got up to turn the \ncount's heavy body toward the wall. \n\nPierre' rose to help him. \n\nWhile the count was being turned over, one \nof his arms fell back helplessly and he made a \nfruitless effort to pull it forward. Whether he \nnoticed the look of terror with which Pierre re- \ngarded that lifeless arm, or whether some other \nthought flitted across his dying brain, at any \nrate he glanced at the refractory arm, at Pierre's \nterror-stricken face, and again at the arm, and \non his face a feeble, piteous smile appeared, \nquite out of keeping with his features, that \nseemed to deride his own helplessness. At sight \nof this smile Pierre felt an unexpected quiver- \ning in his breast and a tickling in his nose, and \ntears dimmed his eyes. The sick man was turned \nonto his side with his face to the wall. He sighed. \n\n"He is dozing," said Anna Mikhaylovna, ob- \nserving that one of the princesses was coming \nto take her turn at watching. "Let us go." \n\nPierre went out. \n\nCHAPTER XXIV \n\nTHERE WAS now no one in the reception \nroom except Prince Vasfli and the eldest prin- \ncess, who were sitting under the portrait of \nCatherine the Great and talking eagerly. As \nsoon as they saw Pierre and his companion they \nbecame silent, and Pierre thought he saw the \nprincess hide something as she whispered: \n\n"I can't bear the sight of that woman." \n\n"Catiche has had tea served in the small draw- \ning room," said Prince Vasili to Anna Mikhay- \nlovna. "Go and take something, my poor Anna \nMikhdylovna, or you will not hold out." \n\nTo Pierre he said nothing, merely giving his \narm a sympathetic squeeze below the shoulder. \nPierre went with Anna Mikhdylovna into the \nsmall drawing room. \n\n"There is nothing so refreshing after a sleep- \n\n\n\nless night as a cup of this delicious Russian tea," \nLorrain was say ing with an air of restrained an- \nimation as he stood sipping tea from a delicate \nChinese handleless cup before a table on which \ntea and a cold supper were laid in the small \ncircular room. Around the table all who were \nat Count Bezukhov's house that night had gath- \nered to fortify themselves. Pierre well remem- \nbered this small circular drawing room with its \nmirrors and little tables. During balls given at \nthe house, Pierre, who did not know how to \ndance, had liked sitting in this room to watch \nthe ladies who, as they passed through in their \nball dresses with diamonds and pearls on their \nbare shoulders, looked at themselves in the \nbrilliantly lighted mirrors which repeated their \nreflections several times. Now this same room \nwas dimly lighted by two candles. On one small \ntable tea things and supper dishes stood in dis- \norder, and in the middle of the night a motley \nthrong of people sat there, not merrymaking, \nbut somberly whispering, and betraying by ev- \nery word and movement that they none of \nthem forgot what was happening and what was \nabout to happen in the bedroom. Pierre did not \neat anything though he would very much have \nliked to. He looked inquiringly at his moni- \ntressand saw that she was again going on tiptoe \nto the reception room where they had left \nPrince Vasfli and the eldest princess. Pierre \nconcluded that this also was essential, and after \na short interval followed her. Anna Mikhdylov- \nna was standing beside the princess, and they \nwere both speaking in excited whispers. \n\n"Permit me, Princess, to know what is neces- \nsary and what is not necessary, "said the young- \ner of the two speakers, evidently in the same \nstate of excitement as when she had slammed \nthe door of her room. \n\n"But, my dear princess," answered Anna \nMikhaylovna blandly but impressively, block- \ning the way to the bedroom and preventing the \nother from passing, "won't this be too much \nfor poor Uncle at a moment when he needs re- \npose? Worldly conversation at a moment when \nhis soul is already prepared . . ." \n\nPrince Vasfli was seated in an easy chair in \nhis familiar attitude, with one leg crossed high \nabove the other. His cheeks, which were so flab- \nby that they looked heavier below, were twitch- \ning violently; but he wore the air of a man lit- \ntle concerned in what the two ladies were say- \ning. \n\n"Come, my dear Anna Mikhdylovna, let Ca- \ntiche do as she pleases. You know how fond \nthe count is of her." \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\n"I don't even know what is in this paper," \nsaid the younger of the two ladies, addressing \nPrince Vasili and pointing to an inlaid port- \nfolio she held in her hand. "All I know is that \nhis real will is in his writing table, and this is a \npaper he has forgotten. . . ." \n\nShe tried to pass Anna Mikhdylovna, but the \nlatter sprang so as to bar her path. \n\n"I know, my dear, kind princess," said Anna \nMikhdylovna, seizing the portfolio so firmly \nthat it was plain she would not let go easily. \n"Dear princess, I beg and implore you, have \nsome pity on him! ]e vous en conjure . . " \n\nThe princess did not reply. Their efforts in \nthe struggle for the portfolio were the only \nsounds Audible, but it was evident that if the \nprincess did speak, her words would not be \nflattering to Anna Mikhdylovna. Though the \nlatter held on tenaciously, her voice lost none \nof its honeyed firmness and softness. \n\n"Pierre, my dear, come here. I think he will \nnot be out of place in a family consultation; is \nl it not so, Prince?" \n\n"Why don't you speak, cousin?" suddenly \nshrieked the princess so loud that those in the \ndrawing room heard her and were startled. \n"Why do you remain silent when heaven \nknows who permits herself to interfere, mak- \ning a scene on the very threshold of a dying \nman's room? Intriguer!" she hissed viciously, \nand tugged with all her might at the portfolio. \n\nBut Anna Mikhdylovna went forward a step \nor two to keep her hold on the portfolio, and \nchanged her grip. \n\nPrince Vasili rose. "Oh!" said he with re- \nproach and surprise, "this is absurd! Come, let \ngo I tell you." \n\nThe princess let go. \n\n"And you too!" \n\nBut Anna Mikhdylovna did not obey him. \n\n"Let go, I tell you! I will take the responsi- \nbility. I myself will go and ask him, I! ... does \nthat satisfy you?" \n\n"But, Prince," said Anna Mikhdylovna, "aft- \ner such a solemn sacrament, allow him a mo- \nment's peace! Here, Pierre, tell them your \nopinion," said she, turning to the young man \nwho, having come quite close, was gazing with \nastonishment at the angry face of the princess \nwhich had lost all dignity, and at the twitch- \ning cheeks of Prince Vasili. \n\n"Remember that you will answer for the con- \nsequences," said Prince Vasili severely. "You \ndon't know what you are doing." \n\n"Vile woman!" shouted the princess, dart- \ning unexpectedly at Anna Mikhdylovna and \n\n\n\nsnatching the portfolio from her. \n\nPriice Vasili bent his head and spread out \nhis hands. \n\nAt this moment that terrible door, which \nPierre had watched so long and which had al- \nways opened so quietly, burst noisily open and \nbanged against the wall, and the second of the \nthree sisters rushed out wringing her hands. \n\n"What are you doing!" she cried vehemently. \n"He isdyingand you leave me alone with him!" \n\nHer sister dropped the portfolio. Anna Mik- \nhdylovna, stooping, quickly caught up the ob- \nject of contention and ran into the bedroom. \nThe eldest princess and Prince Vasfli, recover- \ning themselves, followed her, A few minutes lat- \ner the eldest sister came out with a pale hard \nface, again biting her underlip. At sight of \nPierre her expression showed an irrepressible \nhatred. \n\n"Yes, now you may be glad!" said she; "this \nis what you have been waiting for." And burst- \ning into tears she hid her face in her handker- \nchief and rushed from the room. \n\nPrince Vasili came next. He staggered to the \nsofa on which Pierre was sitting and dropped \nonto it, covering his face with his hand. Pierre \nnoticed that he was pale and that his jaw quiv- \nered and shook as if in an ague. \n\n"Ah, my friend!" said he, taking Pierre by \nthe elbow; and there was in his voice a sincer- \nity and weakness Pierre had never observed in \nit before. "How often we sin, how much we \ndeceive, and all for what? I am near sixty, dear \nfriend ... I too . . . All will end in death, all! \nDeath is awful . . ." and he burst into tears. \n\nAnna Mikhdylovna came out last. She ap- \nproached Pierre with slow, quiet steps. \n\n"Pierre!" she said. \n\nPierre gave her an inquiring look. She kissed \nthe young man on his forehead, wetting him \nwith her tears. Then after a pause she said: \n\n"He is no more " \n\nPierre looked at her over his spectacles. \n\n"Come, I will go with you. Try to weep, noth- \ning gives such relief as tears." \n\nShe led him into the dark drawing room \nand Pierre was glad no one could see his face. \nAnna Mikhdylovna left him, and when she re- \nturned he was fast asleep with his head on his \narm. \n\nIn the morning Anna Mikhdylovna said to \nPierre: \n\n"Yes, my dear, this is a great loss for us all, \nnot to speak of you. But God will support you: \nyou are young, and are now, I hope, in com- \nmand of an immense fortune. The will has not \n\n\n\nBOOK ONE \n\n\n\n47 \n\n\n\nyet been opened. I knowyouwell enough to be \nsure that this will not turn your head, out it \nimposes duties on you, and you must be a man." \n\nPierre was silent. \n\n"Perhaps later on I may tell you, my dear \nboy, that if I had not been there, God only \nknows what would have happened 1 You know, \nUncle promised me only the day before yes- \nterday not to forget Boris. But he had no time. \nI hope, my dear friend, you will carry out your \nfather's wish?" \n\nPierre understood nothing of all this and \ncoloring shyly looked in silence at Princess An- \nna Mikhaylovna. After her talk with Pierre, \nAnna Mikhaylovna returned to the Rost6vs' \nand went to bed. On waking in the morning she \ntold the Rostovs and all her acquaintances the \ndetails of Count Bezukhov's death. She said the \ncount had died as she would herself wish to die, \nthat his end was not only touching but edify- \ning. As to the last meeting between father and \nson, it was so touching that she could not think \nof it without tears, and did not know which \nhad behaved better during those awful mo- \nmentsthe father who so remembered every- \nthing and everybody at the last and had spoken \nsuch pathetic words to the son, or Pierre, whom \nit had been pitiful to see, so stricken was he \nwith grief, though he tried hard to hide it in or- \nder not to sadden his dying father. "It is pain- \nful, but it does one good. It uplifts the soul to \nsee such men as the old count and his worthy \nson," said she. Of the behavior of the eldest \nprincess and Prince Vasili she spoke disapprov- \ningly, but in whispers and as a great secret. \n\nCHAPTER XXV \n\nAT BALD HILLS, Prince Nicholas Andrevich \nBolk6nski's estate, the arrival of young Prince \nAndrew and his wife was daily expected, but \nthis expectation did not upset the regular rou- \ntine of life in the old prince's household. Gen- \neral in Chief Prince Nicholas Andre*evich \n(nicknamed in society, "the King of Prussia") \never since the Emperor Paul had exiled him to \nhis country estate had lived there continuously \nwith his daughter, Princess Mary, and her com- \npanion, Mademoiselle Bourienne. Though in \nthe new reign he was free to return to the capi- \ntals, he still continued to live in the country, \nremarking that anyone who wanted to see him \ncould come the hundred miles from Moscow to \nBald Hills, while he himself needed no one and \nnothing. He used to say that there are only two \nsources of human vice idleness and supersti- \ntion, and only two virtues activity and intel- \n\n\n\nligence. He himself undertook his daughter's \neducation, and to develop these two cardinal \nvirtues in her gave her lessons in algebra and \ngeometry till she was twenty, and arranged her \nlife so that her whole time was occupied. He \nwas himself always occupied: writing his mem- \noirs, solving problems in higher mathematics, \nturning snuffboxes on a lathe, working in the \ngarden, or superintending the building that \nwas always going on at his estate. As regular- \nity is a prime condition facilitating activity, \nregularity in his household was carried to the \nhighest point of exactitude. He always came to \ntable under precisely the same conditions, and \nnot only at the same hour but at the same min- \nute. With those about him, from his daughter \nto his serfs, the prince was sharp and invariably \nexacting, so that without being a hardhearted \nman he inspired such fear and respect as few \nhardhearted men would have aroused. Al- \nthough he was in retirement and had now no \ninfluence in political affairs, every high official \nappointed to the province in which the prince's \nestate lay considered it his duty to visit him and \nwaited in the lofty antechamber just as the ar- \nchitect, gardener, or Princess Mary did, till the \nprince appeared punctually to the appointed \nhour. Everyone sitting in this antechamber ex- \nperienced the same feeling of respect and even \nfear when the enormously high study door \nopened and showed the figure of a rather small \nold man, with powdered wig, small withered \nhands, and bushy gray eyebrows which, when \nhe frowned, sometimes hid the gleam of his \nshrewd, youthfully glittering eyes. \n\nOn the morning of the day that the young \ncouple were to arrive, Princess Mary entered \nthe antechamber as usual at the time appoint- \ned for the morning greeting, crossing herself \nwith trepidation and repeating a silent prayer. \nEvery morning she came in like that, and ev- \nery morning she prayed that the daily interview \nmight pass off well. \n\nAn old powdered manservant who was sit- \nting in the antechamber rose quietly and said \nin a whisper: "Please walk in." \n\nThrough the door came the regular hum of \na lathe. The princess timidly opened the door \nwhich moved noiselessly and easily. She paused \nat the entrance. The prince was working at the \nlathe and after glancing round continued his \nwork. \n\nThe enormous study was full of things evi- \ndently in constant use. The large table covered \nwith books and plans, the tall glass-fronted \nbookcases with keys in the locks, the high desk \n\n\n\n4 8 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nfor writing while standing up, on which lay an \nopen exercise book, and the lathe with tools \nlaid ready to hand and shavings scattered \naroundall indicated continuous, varied, and \norderly activity. The motion of the small foot \nshod in a Tartar boot embroidered with silver, \nand the firm pressure of the lean sinewy hand, \nshowed that the prince still possessed the tena- \ncious endurance and vigor of hardy old age. \nAfter a few more turns of the lathe he removed \nhis foot from the pedal, wiped his chisel, \ndropped it into a leather pouch attached to the \nlathe, and, approaching the table, summoned \nhis daughter. He never gave his children a bless- \ning, so he simply held out his bristly cheek (as \nyet unshaven) and, regarding her tenderly and \nattentively, said severely: \n\n"Quite well? All right then, sit down." He \ntook the exercise book containing lessons in \ngeometry written by himself and drew up a \nchair with his foot. \n\n"For tomorrow!" said he, quickly finding \nthe page and making a scratch from one para- \ngraph to another with his hard nail. \n\nThe princess bent over the exercise book on \nthe table. \n\n"Wait a bit, here's a letter for you," said the \nold man suddenly, taking a letter addressed in \na woman's hand from a bag hanging above the \ntable, onto which he threw it. \n\nAt the sight of the letter red patches showed \nthemselves on the princess' face. She took it \nquickly and bent her head over it. \n\n"From H^loi'se?" asked the prince with a \ncold smile that showed hisstill sound, yellowish \nteeth. 1 \n\n"Yes, it's from Julie," replied the princess \nwith a timid glance and a timid smile. \n\n"I'll let two more letters pass, but the third \nI'll read," said the prince sternly; "I'm afraid \nyou write much nonsense. I'll read the third I" \n\n"Read this if you like, Father," said the prin- \ncess, blushing still more and holding out the \nletter. \n\n"The third,! said the third 1" cried theprince \nabruptly, pushing the letter away, and leaning \nhis elbows on the table he drew toward him \nthe exercise book containing geometrical fig- \nures. \n\n"Well, madam," he began, stooping over the \nbook close to his daughter and placing an arm \non the back of the chair on which she sat, so \n\n1 The prince is ironical. He knows the letter is \nfrom Julie, but alludes to Rousseau's novel, Julie, \nou la nouvelle Htloise, which he, an admirer of \nVoltaire and of cold reason, heartily despised. TR. \n\n\n\nthat she felt herself surrounded on all sides by \nthe skrid scent of old age and tobacco, which \nshe had known so long. "Now, madam, these \ntriangles are equal; please note that the angle \nABC . . ." \n\nThe princess looked in a scared way at her \nfather's eyes glittering close to her; the red \npatches on her face came and went, and it was \nplain that she understood nothing and was so \nfrightened that her fear would prevent her un- \nderstanding any of her father's further explana- \ntions, however clear they might be. Whether it \nwas the teacher's fault or the pupil's, this same \nthing happened every day: the princess' eyes \ngrew dim, she could not see and could not hear \nanything, but was only conscious of her stern \nfather's withered face close to her, of his breath \nand the smell of him, and could think only of \nhow to get away quickly to her own room to \nmake out the problem in peace. The old man \nwas beside himself: moved the chair on which \nhe was sitting noisily backward and forward, \nmade efforts to control himself and not become \nvehement, but almost always did become ve- \nhement, scolded, and sometimes flung the ex- \nercise book away. \n\nThe princess gave a wrong answer. \n\n"Well now, isn't she a fool!" shouted the \nprince, pushing the book aside and turning \nsharply away; but rising immediately, he paced \nup and down, lightly touched his daughter's \nhair and sat down again. \n\nHe drew up his chair and continued to ex- \nplain. \n\n"This won't do, Princess; it won't do," said \nhe, when Princess Mary, having taken and \nclosed the exercise book with the next day's \nlesson, was about to leave: "Mathematics are \nmost important, madam! I don't want to have \nyou like our silly ladies. Get used to it and \nyou'll like it," and he patted her cheek. "It will \ndrive all the nonsense out of your head." \n\nShe turned to go, but he stopped her with a \ngesture and took an uncut book from the high \ndesk. \n\n"Here is some sort of Key to the Mysteries \nthat your Hdoi'se has sent you. Religious! I \ndon't interfere with anyone's belief ... I have \nlooked at it. Take it. Well, now go. Go." \n\nHe patted her on the shoulder and himself \nclosed the door after her. \n\nPrincess Mary went back to her room with \nthe sad, scared expression that rarely left her \nand which made her plain, sickly face yet plain- \ner. She sat down at her writing table, on which \nstood miniature portraits and which was lit- \n\n\n\nBOOK \n\ntered with books and papers. The princdfcs was \nas untidy as her father was tidy. She put down \nthe geometry book and eagerly broke the seal \nof her letter. It was from her most intimate \nfriend from childhood; that same Julie Kara- \ngina who had been at the Rost6vs' name-day \nparty. \nJulie wrote in French: \n\nDear and precious Friend, How terrible and \nfrightful a thing is separation! Though I tell my- \nself that half my life and half my happiness are \nwrapped up in you, and that in spite of the distance \nseparating us our hearts are united by indissoluble \nbonds, my heart rebels against fate and in spite of \nthe pleasures and distractions around me I cannot \novercome a certain secret sorrow that has been in \nmy heart ever since we parted. Why are we not \ntogether as we were last summer, in your big study, \non the blue sofa, the confidential sofa? Why can- \nnot I now, as three months ago, draw fresh moral \nstrength from your look, so gen tie, calm, and pene- \ntrating, a look I loved so well and seem to see be- \nfore me as I write? \n\nHaving read thus far, Princess Mary sighed \nand glanced into the mirror which stood on her \nright. It reflected a weak, ungraceful figure and \nthin face. Her eyes, always sad, now looked with \nparticular hopelessness at her reflection in the \nglass. "She flatters me," thought the princess, \nturning away and continuing to read. But Julie \ndid not flatter her friend, the princess' eyes- \nlarge, deep and luminous (it seemed as if at \ntimes there radiated from them shafts of warm \nlight) were so beautiful that very of ten in spite \nof the plainness of her face they gave her an at- \ntraction more powerful than that of beauty. \nBut the princess never saw the beautiful ex- \npression of her own eyes the look they had \nwhen she was not thinking of herself. As with \neveryone, her face assumed a forced unnatural \nexpression as soon as she looked in a glass. She \nwent on reading: \n\nAll Moscow talks of nothing but war. One of my \ntwo brothers is already abroad, the other is with \nthe Guards, who are starting on their march to the \nfrontier. Our dear Emperor has left Petersburg \nand it is thought intends to expose his precious \nperson to the chances of war. God grant that the \nCorsican monster who is destroying the peace of \nEurope may be overthrown by the angel whom it \nhas pleased the Almighty, in His goodness, to give \nus as sovereignl To say nothing of my brothers, this \nwar has deprived me of one of the associations \nnearest my heart. I mean young Nicholas Rostov, \nwho with his enthusiasm could not bear to remain \ninactive and has left the university to join the \narmy. I will confess to you, dear Mary, that in spite \nof his extreme youth his departure for the army \n\n\n\nONE \n\n\n\n49 \n\n\n\nwas a great grief to me. This young man, of whom \nI spoke to you last summer, is so noble-minded \nand full of that real youthfulness which one sel- \ndom finds nowadays among our old men of twenty \nand, particularly, he is so frank and has so much \nheart. He is so pure and poetic that my relations \nwith him, transient as they were, have been one \nof the sweetest comforts to my poor heart, which \nhas already suffered so much. Someday I will tell \nyou about our parting and all that was said then. \nThat is still too fresh. Ah, dear friend, you are \nhappy not to know these poignant joys and sor- \nrows. You are fortunate, for the latter are gen- \nerally the stronger! I know very well that Count \nNicholas is too young ever to be more to me than \na friend, but this sweet friendship, this poetic and \npure intimacy, were what my heart needed. But \nenough of this! The chief news, about which all \nMoscow gossips, is the death of old Count Bezuk- \nhov, and his inheritance. Fancy! The three prin- \ncesses have received very little, Prince Vasili noth- \ning, and it is Monsieur Pierre who has inherited \nall the property and has besides been recognized \nas legitimate; so that he is now Count Bezukhov \nand possessor of the finest fortune in Russia. It is \nrumored that Prince Vasili played a very despi- \ncable part in this affair and that he returned to \nPetersburg quite crestfallen. \n\nI confess I understand very little about all these \nmatters of wills and inheritance; but I do know \nthat since this young man, whom we all used to \nknow as plain Monsieur Pierre, has become Count \nBezukhov and the owner of one of the largest \nfortunes in Russia, I am much amused to watch \nthe change in the tone and manners of the mam- \nmas burdened by marriageable daughters, and of \nthe young ladies themselves, toward him, though, \nbetween you and me, he always seemed to me a \npoor sort of fellow. As for the past two years people \nhave amused themselves by finding husbands for \nme (most of whom I don't even know), the match- \nmaking chronicles of Moscow now speak of me as \nthe f u ture Countess Bezukhova. But you will under- \nstand that I have no desire for the post. A propos \nof marriages: do you know that a while ago that \nuniversal auntie Anna Mikhaylovna told me, un- \nder the seal of strict secrecy, of a plan of marriage \nfor you. It is neither more nor less than with \nPrince Vasfli's son Anatole, whom they wish to re- \nform by marrying him to someone rich and dis~ \ntinguee, and it is on you that his relations' choice \nhas fallen. I don't know what you will think of it, \nbut I consider it my duty to let you know of it. He \nis said to be very handsome and a terrible scape- \ngrace. That is all I have been able to find out \nabout him. \n\nBut enough of gossip. I am at the end of my \nsecond sheet of paper, and Mamma has sent for me \nto go and dine at the Apraksins'. Read the mystical \nbook I am sending you; it has an enormous success \nhere. Though there are things in it difficult for the \nfeeble human mind to grasp, it is an admirable \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nbook which calms and elevates the soul. Adieu! \nGive my respects to monsieur your father and my \ncompliments to Mademoiselle Bourienne. 1 em- \nbrace you as I love you. JULIE \n\nP.S. Let me have news of your brother and his \ncharming little wife. \n\nThe princess pondered awhile with a \nthoughtful smile and her luminous eyes lit up \nso that her face was entirely transformed. Then \nshe suddenly rose and with her heavy tread \nwent up to the table. She took a sheet of paper \nand her hand moved rapidly over it. This is the \nreply she wrote, also in French: \n\nDear and precious Friend, Your letter of the \ni$th has given me great delight. So you still love \nme, my romantic Julie? Separation, of which you \nsay so much that is bad, does not seem to have had \nits usual effect on you. You complain of our sepa- \nration. What then should I say, if I dared com- \nplain, I who am deprived of all who are dear to \nme? Ah, if we had not religion to console us life \nwould be very sad. Why do you suppose that I \nshould look severely on your affection for that \nyoung man? On such matters I am only severe with \nmyself. I understand such feelings in others, and \nif never having felt them I cannot approve of \nthem, neither do I condemn them. Only it seems \nto me that Christian love, love of one's neighbor, \nlove of one's enemy, is worthier, sweeter, and bet- \nter than the feelings which the beautiful eyes of a \nyoung man can inspire in a romantic and loving \nyoung girl like yourself. \n\nThe news of Count Beziikhov's death reached \nus before your letter and my father was much \naffected by it. He says the count was the last rep- \nresentative but one of the great century, and that \nit is his own turn now, but that he will do all he \ncan to let his turn come as late as possible. God \npreserve us from that terrible misfortune! \n\nI cannot agree with you about Pierre, whom I \nknew as a child. He always seemed to me to have \nan excellent heart, and that is the quality I value \nmost in people. As to his inheritance and the part \nplayed by Prince Vasili, it is very sad for both. \nAh, my dear friend, our divine Saviour's words, \nthat it is easier for a camel to go through the eye \nof a needle than for a rich man to enter the King- \ndom of God, are terribly true. I pity Prince Vasili \nbut am still more sorry for Pierre. So young, and \nburdened with such riches to what temptations \nhe will be exposedl If I were asked what I desire \nmost on earth, it would be to be poorer than the \npoorest beggar. A thousand thanks, dear friend, \nfor the volume you have sent me and which has \nsuch success in Moscow. Yet since you tell me that \namong some good things it contains others which \nour weak human understanding cannot grasp, it \nseems to me rather useless to spend time in reading \nwhat is unintelligible and can therefore bear no \nfruit. I never could understand the fondness some \npeople have for confusing their minds by dwelling \n\n\n\non my^ical books that merely awaken their doubts \nand excite their imagination, giving them a bent \nfor exaggeration quite contrary to Christian sim- \nplicity. Let us rather read the Epistles and Gospels. \nLet us not seek to penetrate what mysteries they \ncontain; for how can we, miserable sinners that we \nare, know the terrible and holy secrets of Provi- \ndence while we remain in this flesh which forms \nan impenetrable veil between us and the Eternal? \nLet us rather confine ourselves to studying those \nsublime rules which our divine Saviour has left \nfor our guidance here below. Let us try to conform \nto them and follow them, and let us be persuaded \nthat the less we let our feeble human minds roam, \nthe better we shall please God, who rejects all \nknowledge that does not come from Him; and the \nless we seek to fathom what He has been pleased \nto conceal from us, the sooner will He vouchsafe \nits revelation to us through His divine Spirit. \n\nMy father has not spoken to me of a suitor, but \nhas only told me that he has received a letter and \nis expecting a visit from Prince Vasili. In regard \nto this project of marriage for me, I will tell you, \ndear sweet friend, that I look on marriage as a \ndivine institution to which we must conform. \nHowever painful it may be to me, should the Al- \nmighty ever lay the duties of wife and mother upon \nme I shall try to perform them as faithfully as \nI can, without disquieting myself by examining my \nfeelings toward him whom He may give me for \nhusband. \n\nI have had a letter from my brother, who an- \nnounces his speedy arrival at Bald Hills with his \nwife. This pleasure will be but a brief one, how- \never, for he will leave us again to take part in this \nunhappy war into which we have been drawn, \nGod knows how or why. Not only where you are \nat the heart of affairs and of the world is the \ntalk all of war, even here amid fieldwork and the \ncalm of nature which townsfolk consider char- \nacteristic of the country rumors of war are heard \nand painfully felt. My father talks of nothing but \nmarches and countermarches, things of which 1 \nunderstand nothing; and the day before yesterday \nduring my daily walk through the village I wit- \nnessed a heartrending scene. ... It was a convoy \nof conscripts enrolled from our people and start- \ning to join the army. You should have seen the \nstate of the mothers, wives, and children of the \nmen who were going and should have heard the \nsobs. It seems as though mankind has forgotten \nthe laws of its divine Saviour, Who preached love \nand forgiveness of injuries and that men attribute \nthe greatest merit to skill in killing one another. \n\nAdieu, dear and kind friend; may our divine \nSaviour and His most Holy Mother keep you in \ntheir holy and all-powerful carel MARY \n\n"Ah, you are sending off a letter, Princess? I \nhave already dispatched mine. I have written \nto my poor mother, "said the smiling Mademoi- \nselle Bourienne rapidly, in her pleasant mellow \n\n\n\nBOOK ONE \n\n\n\ntones and with guttural r's. She brought into \nPrincess Mary's strenuous, mournful, and \ngloomy world a quite different atmosphere, \ncareless, lighthearted, and self -satisfied. \n\n"Princess, I must warn you," she added, low- \nering her voice and evidently listening to her- \nself with pleasure, and speaking with exagger- \nated grasseyement? "the prince has been scold- \ning Michael Ivanovich. He is in a very bad hu- \nmor, very morose. Be prepared." \n\n"Ah, dear friend," replied Princess Mary, "I \nhave asked you never to warn me of the \nhumor my father is in. I do not allow my- \nself to judge him and would not have others \ndo so." \n\nThe princess glanced at her watch and, see- \ning that she was five minutes late in starting \nher practice on the clavichord, went into the \nsitting room with a look of alarm. Between \ntwelve and two o'clock, as the day was mapped \nout, the prince rested and the princess played \nthe clavichord. \n\nCHAPTER XXVI \n\nTHE CRAY-HAIRED valet was sitting drowsily lis- \ntening to the snoring of the prince, who was in \nhis large study. From the far side of the house \nthrough the closed doors came the sound of \ndifficult passages twenty times repeated of a \nsonata by Dussek. \n\nJust then a closed carriage and another with \na hood drove up to the porch. Prince Andrew \ngot out of the carriage, helped his little wife to \nalight, and let her pass into the house before \nhim. Old Tfkhon, wearing a wig, put his head \nout of the door of the antechamber, reported \nin a whisper that the prince was sleeping, and \nhastily closed the door. Tfkhon knew that nei- \nther the son's arrival nor any other unusual \nevent must be allowed to disturb the appointed \norder of the day. Prince Andrew apparently \nknew this as well as Tfkhon; he looked at his \nwatch as if to ascertain whether his father's hab- \nits had changed since he was at home last, and, \nhaving assured himself that they had not, he \nturned to his wife. \n\n"He will get up in twenty minutes. Let us go \nacross to Mary's room," he said. \n\nThe little princess had grown stouter during \nthis time, but her eyes and her short, downy, \nsmiling lip lifted when she began to speak \njust as merrily and prettily as ever. \n\n"Why, this is a palace!" she said to her hus- \nband, looking around with the expression with \n\n1 The guttural pronunciation of the letter r, \nchiefly affected by Parisians.-TR. \n\n\n\nwhich people compliment their host at a ball. \n"Let's come, quick, quick!'* And with a glance \nround, she smiled at Tfkhon, at her husband, \nand at the footman who accompanied them. \n\n"Is that Mary practicing? Let's goquietlyand \ntake her by surprise." \n\nPrince Andrew followed her with a courteous \nbut sad expression. \n\n"You've grown older, Tfkhon," he said in \npassing to the old man, who kissed his hand. \n\nBefore they reached the room from which the \nsounds of the clavichord came, the pretty, fair- \nhaired Frenchwoman, Mademoiselle Bouri- \nenne, rushed out apparently beside herself with \ndelight. \n\n"Ah! what joy for the princess!" exclaimed \nshe: "At last! I must let her know." \n\n"No, no, please not . . . You are Mademoiselle \nBourienne," said the little princess, kissing her. \n"I know you already through my sister-in-law's \nfriendship for you. She was not expecting us?" \n\nThey went up to the door of the sitting room \nfrom which came the sound of the oft-repeated \npassage of the sonata. Prince Andrew stopped \nand made a grimace, as if expecting something \nunpleasant. \n\nThe little princess entered the room. The \npassage broke off in the middle, a cry was \nheard, then Princess Mary's heavy tread and the \nsound of kissing. When Prince Andrew went \nin the two princesses, who had only met once \nbefore for a short time at his wedding, were \nin each other's arms warmly pressing their lips \nto whatever place they happened to touch. \nMademoiselle Bourienne stood near them press- \ning her hand to her heart, with a beatific smile \nand obviously equally ready to cry or to laugh. \nPrince Andrew shrugged his shoulders and \nfrowned, as lovers of music do when they hear \na false note. The two women let go of one an- \nother, and then, as if afraid of being too late, \nseized each other's hands, kissing them and \npulling them away, and again began kissing \neach other on the face, and then to Prince An- \ndrew's surprise both began to cry and kissed \nagain. Mademoiselle Bourienne also began to \ncry. Prince Andrew evidently felt ill at ease, \nbut to the two women it seemed quite natural \nthat they should cry, and apparently it never \nentered their heads that it could have been \notherwise at this meeting. \n\n"Ah! my dear! . . . Ah! Mary! . . ." they sud- \ndenly exclaimed, and then laughed. "I dreamed \nlast night . . .""You were not expecting us? \n. . .""Ah! Mary, you have got thinner! . . ," \n"And you have grown stouter! ..." \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\n"I knew the princess at once," put in Made- \nmoiselle Bourienne. \n\n"And I had no idea! . . ." exclaimed Prin- \ncess Mary. "Ah, Andrew, I did not see you." \n\nPrince Andrew and his sister, hand in \nhand, kissed one another, and he told her she \nwas still the same crybaby as ever. Princess \nMary had turned toward her brother, and \nthrough her tears the loving, warm, gentle \nlook of her large luminous eyes, very beautiful \nat that moment, rested on Prince Andrew's \nface. \n\nThe little princess talked incessantly, her \nshort, downy upper lip continually and rapid- \nly touching her rosy nether lip when necessary \nand drawing up again next moment when her \nface broke into a smile of glittering teeth and \nsparkling eyes. She told of an accident they had \nhad on the Spisski Hill which might have been \nserious for her in her condition, and immedi- \nately after that informed them that she had left \nall her clothes in Petersburg and that heaven \nknew what she would have to dress in here; \nand that Andrew had quite changed, and that \nKitty Odyntsova had married an old man, and \nthat there was a suitor for Mary, a real one, \nbut that they would talk of that later. Princess \nMary was still looking silently at her brother \nand her beautiful eyes were full of love and \nsadness. It was plain that she was following a \ntrain of thought independent of her sister-in- \nlaw's words. In the midst of a description of \nthe last Petersburg fete she addressed her broth- \ner: \n\n"So you are really going to the war, Andrew?" \nshe said sighing. \n\nLise sighed too. \n\n"Yes, and even tomorrow," replied her broth- \nen \n\n"He is leaving me here; God knows why, \nwhen he might have had promotion . . ." \n\nPrincess Mary did not listen to the end, but \ncontinuing her train of thought turned to her \nsister-in-law with a tender glance at her figure. \n\n"Is it certain?" she said. \n\nThe face of the little princess changed. She \nsighed and said: "Yes, quite certain. Ahl it is \nvery dreadful . . ." \n\nHer lip descended. She brought her face \nclose to her sister-in-law's and unexpectedly \nagain began to cry. \n\n"She needs rest," said Prince Andrew with \na frown. "Don't you, Lise? Take her to your \nroom and I'll go to Father. How is he? Just the \nsame?" \n\n"Yes, just the same. Though I don't know \n\n\n\nwhat fyour opinion will be," answered the prin- \ncess joyfully. \n\n"And are the hours the same? And the walks \nin the avenues? And the lathe?" asked Prince \nAndrew with a scarcely perceptible smile which \nshowed that, in spite of all his love and respect \nfor his father, he was aware of his weaknesses. \n\n"The hours are the same, and the lathe, and \nalso the mathematics and my geometry lessons," \nsaid Princess Mary gleefully, as if her lessons \nin geometry were among the greatest delights \nof her life. \n\nWhen the twenty minutes had elapsed and \nthe time had come for the old prince to get up, \nTikhon came to call the young prince to his \nfather. The old man made a departure from his \nusual routine in honor of his son's arrival: he \ngave orders to admit him to his apartments \nwhile he dressed for dinner. The old prince al- \nways dressed in old-fashioned style, wearing an \nantique coat and powdered hair; and when \nPrince Andrew entered his father's dressing \nroom (not with the contemptuous look and \nmanner he wore in drawing rooms, but with \nthe animated face with which he talked to \nPierre), the old man was sitting on a large \nleather-covered chair, wrapped in a powder- \ning mantle, entrusting his head to Tikhon. \n\n"Ah! here's the warrior! Wants to vanquish \nBuonaparte?" said the old man, shaking his \npowdered head as much as the tail, which Tik- \nhon was holding fast to plait, would allow. \n\n"You at least must tackle him properly, or \nelse if he goes on like this he'll soon have us, \ntoo, for his subjects! How are you?" And he \nheld out his cheek. \n\nThe old man was in a good temper after his \nnap before dinner. (He used to say that a nap \n"after dinner was silver before dinner, gold- \nen.") He cast happy, sidelong glances at his son \nfrom under his thick, bushy eyebrows. Prince \nAndrew went up and kissed his father on the \nspot indicated to him. He made no reply on \nhis father's favorite topic making fun of the \nmilitary men of the day, and more particular- \nly of Bonaparte. \n\n"Yes, Father, I have come to you and brought \nmy wife who is pregnant," said Prince Andrew, \nfollowing every movement of his father's face \nwith an eager and respectful look. "How is your \nhealth?" \n\n"Only fools and rakes fall ill, my boy. You \nknow me: I am busy from morning till night \nand abstemious, so of course I am well." \n\n"Thank God," said his son smiling. \n\n"God has nothing to do with it! Well, go on," \n\n\n\nBOOK ONE \n\n\n\n53 \n\n\n\nhe continued, returning to his hobby; "till me \nhow the Germans have taught you to fight Bo- \nnaparte by this new science you call 'strategy.' " \n\nPrince Andrew smiled. \n\n"Give me time to collect my wits, Father," \nsaid he, with a smile that showed that his fa- \nther's foibles did not prevent his son from lov- \ning and honoring him. "Why, I have not yet \nhad time to settle downl" \n\n"Nonsense, nonsense!" cried the old man, \nshaking his pigtail to see whether it was firmly \nplaited, and grasping hisson by the hand. "The \nhouse for your wife is ready. Princess Mary will \ntake her there and show her over, and they'll \ntalk nineteen to the dozen. That's their wom- \nan's way! I am glad to have her. Sit down and \ntalk. About Mikhelson's army I understand \nTolst6y's too ... a simultaneous expedition. . . . \nBut what's the southern army to do? Prussia is \nneutral ... I know that. What about Austria?" \nsaid he, rising from his chair and pacing up \nand down the room followed by Tikhon, who \nran after him, handing him different articles \nof clothing. "What of Sweden? How will they \ncross Pomerania?" \n\nPrince Andrew, seeing that his father in- \nsisted, began at first reluctantly, but gradual- \nly with more and more animation, and from \nhabit changing unconsciously from Russian to \nFrench as he went on to explain the plan of \noperation for the coming campaign. He ex- \nplained how an army, ninety thousand strong, \nwas to threaten Prussia so as to bring her out \nof her neutrality and draw her into the war; \nhow part of that army was to join some Swedish \nforces at Stralsund; how two hundred and \ntwenty thousand Austrians, with a hundred \nthousand Russians, were to operate in Italy and \non the Rhine; how fifty thousand Russians and \nas many English were to land at Naples, and \nhow a total force of five hundred thousand \nmen was to attack the French from different \nsides. The old prince did not evince the least \ninterest during this explanation, but as if he \nwere not listening to it continued to dress while \nwalking about, and three times unexpectedly \ninterrupted. Once he stopped it by shouting: \n"The white one, the white one!" \n\nThis meant that Tfkhon was not handing \nhim the waistcoat he wanted. Another time he \ninterrupted, saying: \n\n"And will she soon be confined?" and shak- \ning his head reproachfully said: "That's bad! \nGo on, go on." \n\nThe third interruption came when Prince \nAndrew was finishing his description. The old \n\n\n\nman began to sing, in the cracked voice of old \nage: "Malbrook s'en va-t-en guerre. Dieu salt \nquand reviendra." * \n\nHis son only smiled. \n\n"I don't say it's a plan I approve of," said \nthe son; "I am only telling you what it is. Na- \npoleon has also formed his plan by now, not \nworse than this one." \n\n"Well, you've told me nothing new," and the \nold man repeated, meditatively and rapidly: \n\n"Dieu salt quand reviendra. Go to the din- \ning room." \n\nCHAPTER XXVII \n\nAT THE appointed hour the prince, powdered \nand shaven, entered the dining room where his \ndaughter-in-law, Princess Mary, and Mademoi- \nselle Bourienne were already awaiting him to- \ngether with his architect, who by a strange ca- \nprice of his employer's was admitted to table \nthough the position of that insignificant indi- \nvidual was such as could certainly not have \ncaused him to expect that honor. The prince, \nwho generally kept very strictly to social dis- \ntinctions and rarely admitted even important \ngovernment officials to his table, had unex- \npectedly selected Michael Iviinovich (who al- \nways went into a corner to blow his nose on his \nchecked handkerchief) to illustrate the theory \nthat all men are equals, and had more than \nonce impressed on his daughter that Michael \nIvanovich was "not a whit worse than you or \nI." At dinner the prince usually spoke to the \ntaciturn Michael Ivanovich more often than to \nanyone else. \n\nIn the dining room, which like all the rooms \nin the house was exceedingly lofty, the mem- \nbers of the household and the footmen one \nbehind each chair stood waiting for the prince \nto enter. The head butler, napkin on arm, \nwas scanning the setting of the table, making \nsigns to the footmen, and anxiously glancing \nfrom the clock to the door by which the prince \nwas to enter. Prince Andrew was looking at \na large gilt frame, new to him, containing \nthe genealogical tree of the Princes Bolk6n- \nski, opposite which hung another such frame \nwith a badly painted portrait (evidently by \nthe hand of the artist belonging to the estate) \nof a ruling prince, in a crown an alleged de- \nscendant of Rurik and ancestor of the Bolkdn- \nskis. Prince Andrew, looking again at that gene- \nalogical tree, shook his head, laughing as a man \nlaughs who looks at a portrait so characteristic \n\n1 "Marlborough is going to the wars; God knows \nwhen he'll return." \n\n\n\n54 \n\n\n\nof the original as to be amusing. \n\n"How thoroughly like him that is!" he said \nto Princess Mary, who had come up to him. \n\nPrincess Mary looked at her brother in sur- \nprise. She did not understand what he was \nlaughing at. Everything her father did inspired \nher with reverence and was beyond question. \n\n"Everyone has his Achilles' heel," continued \nPrince Andrew. "Fancy, with his powerful \nmind, indulging in such nonsense!" \n\nPrincess Mary could not understand the bold- \nness of her brother's criticism and was about to \nreply, when the expected footsteps were heard \ncoming from the study. The prince walked in \nquickly and jauntily as was his wont, as if in- \ntentionally contrasting the briskness of his \nmanners with the strict formality of his house. \nAt that moment the great clock struck two and \nanother with a shrill tone joined in from the \ndrawing room. The prince stood still; his lively \nglittering eyes from under their thick, bushy \neyebrows sternly scanned all present and rested \non the little princess. She felt, as courtiers do \nwhen the Tsar enters, the sensation of fear and \nrespect which the old man inspired in all \naround him. He stroked her hair and then pat- \nted her awkwardly on the back of her neck. \n\n"I'm glad, glad, to see you," he said, looking \nattentively into her eyes, and then quickly went \nto his place and sat down. "Sit down, sit down! \nSit down, Michael Iva"novichl" \n\nHe indicated a place beside him to his daugh- \nter-in-law. A footman moved the chair for her. \n\n"Ho, ho!" said the old man, casting his eyes \non her rounded figure. "You've been in a hur- \nry. That's bad I" \n\nHe laughed in his usual dry, cold, unpleas- \nant way, with his lips only and not with his \neyes. \n\n"You must walk, walk as much as possible, as \nmuch as possible," he said. \n\nThe little princess did not, or did not wish \nto, hear his words. She was silent and seemed \nconfused. The prince asked her about her fa- \nther, and she began to smile and talk. He asked \nabout mutual acquaintances, and she became \nstill more animated and chattered away giving \nhim greetings from various people and retail- \ning the town gossip. \n\n"Countess Aprdksina, poor thing, has lost \nher husband and she has cried her eyes out," \nshe said, growing more and more lively. \n\nAs she became animated the prince looked \nat her more and more sternly, and suddenly, \nas if he had studied her sufficiently and had \nformed a definite idea of her, he turned away \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\nand Addressed Michael Iv^novich. \n\n"Well, Michael Ivdnovich, our Bonaparte \nwill be having a bad time of it. Prince Andrew" \n(he always spoke thus of his son) "has been \ntelling me what forces are being collected \nagainst him! While you and I never thought \nmuch of him." \n\nMichael Ivdnovich did not at all know when \n"you and I" had said such things about Bon- \naparte, but understanding that he was wanted \nas a peg on which to hang the prince's favorite \ntopic, he looked inquiringly at the young \nprince, wondering what would follow. \n\n"He is a great tactician!" said the prince to \nhis son, pointing to the architect. \n\nAnd the conversation again turned on the \nwar, on Bonaparte, and the generals and states- \nmen of the day. The old prince seemed con- \nvinced not only that all the men of the day \nwere mere babies who did not know the ABC \nof war or of politics, and that Bonaparte was \nan insignificant little Frenchy, successful only \nbecause there were no longer any Potemkins \nor Suvrirovs left to oppose him; but he was al- \nso convinced that there were no political diffi- \nculties in Europe and no real war, but only a \nsort of puppet show at which the men of the \nday were playing, pretending to do something \nreal. Prince Andrew gaily bore with his father's \nridicule of the new men, and drew him on and \nlistened to him with evident pleasure. \n\n"The past always seems good," said he, "but \ndid not Suv6rov himself fall into a trap Mo- \nreau set him, and from which he did not know \nhow to escape?" \n\n"Who told you that? Who?" cried the prince. \n"Suv6rov!" And he jerked away his plate, which \nTikhon briskly caught. "Suvorov! . . . Consider, \nPrince Andrew. Two . . . Frederick and Suvo- \nrov; Moreau! . . . Moreau would have been a \nprisoner if Suv6rov had had a free hand; but \nhe had the Hofs-kriegs-wurst-schnapps-Rath l \non his hands. It would have puzzled the devil \nhimself! When you get there you'll find out \nwhat those Hofs-kriegs-wurst-Raths are! Suv6- \nrov couldn't manage them so what chance has \nMichael Kutiizov? No, my dear boy," he con- \ntinued, "you and your generals won't get on \nagainst Buonaparte; you'll have to call in the \nFrench, so that birds of a feather may fight to- \ngether. The German, Pahlen, has been sent to \nNew York in America, to fetch the Frenchman, \nMoreau," he said, alluding to the invitation \nmade that year to Moreau to enter the Russian \n\n1 "Court- war-sausage-schnapps-Council," the \nAustrian Council of War. TR. \n\n\n\nBOOK ONE \n\n\n\n55 \n\n\n\nservice. . . . "Wonderful I . . . Were the Potem- \nkins, Suv6rovs, and Orl6vs Germans? No, lad, \neither you fellows have all lost your wits, or I \nhave outlived mine. May God help you, but \nwe'll see what will happen. Buonaparte has \nbecome a great commander among them! \nHm! . . ." \n\n"I don't at all say that all the plans are good," \nsaid Prince Andrew, "I am only surprised at \nyour opinion of Bonaparte. You may laugh as \nmuch as you like, but all the same Bonaparte is \na great general 1" \n\n"Michael Ivdnovich!" cried the old prince \nto the architect who, busy with his roast meat, \nhoped he had been forgotten: "Didn't I tell \nyou Buonaparte was a great tactician? Here, he \nsays the same thing." \n\n"To be sure, your excellency," replied the \narchitect. \n\nThe prince again laughed his frigid laugh. \n\n"Buonaparte was born with a silver spoon \nin his mouth. He has got splendid soldiers. Be- \nsides he began by attacking Germans. And on- \nly idlers have failed to beat the Germans. Since \nthe world began everybody has beaten the Ger- \nmans. They beat no one except one another. \nHe made his reputation fighting them." \n\nAnd the prince began explaining all the \nblunders which, according to him, Bonaparte \nhad made in his campaigns and even in poli- \ntics. His son made no rejoinder, but it was evi- \ndent that whatever arguments were presented \nhe was as little able as his father to change his \nopinion. He listened, refraining from a reply, \nand involuntarily wondered how this old man, \nliving alone in the country for so many years, \ncould know and discuss so minutely and acute- \nly all the recent European military and politi- \ncal events. \n\n"You think I'm an old man and don't un- \nderstand the present state of affairs?" con- \ncluded his father. "But it troubles me. I don't \nsleep at night. Come now, where has this great \ncommander of yours shown his skill?" he con- \ncluded. \n\n"That would take too long to tell, "answered \nthe son. \n\n"Well, then gooff to your Buonaparte 1 Made- \nmoiselle Bourienne, here's another admirer of \nthat powder-monkey emperor of yours," he ex- \nclaimed in excellent French. \n\n"You know, Prince, I am not a Bonapartist!" \n\n"Dieu salt quand reviendra" . . . hummed \nthe prince out of tune and, with a laugh still \nmore so, he quitted the table. \n\nThe little princess during the whole discus- \n\n\n\nsion and the rest of the dinner sat silent, glanc- \ning with a frightened look now at her father- \nin-law and now at Princess Mary. When they \nleft the table she took her sister-in-law's arm \nand drew her into another room. \n\n"What a clever man your father is," said \nshe; "perhaps that is why I am afraid of him." \n\n"Oh, he is so kind I "answered Princess Mary. \n\nCHAPTER XXVIII \n\nPRINCE ANDREW was to leave next evening. The \nold prince, not altering his routine, retired as \nusual after dinner. The little princess was in \nher sister-in-law's room. Prince Andrew in a \ntraveling coat without epaulettes had been \npacking with his valet in the rooms assigned to \nhim. After inspecting the carriage himself and \nseeing the trunks put in, he ordered the horses \nto be harnessed. Only those things he always \nkept with him remained in his room; a small \nbox, a large canteen fitted with silver plate, two \nTurkish pistols and a saber a present from his \nfather who had brought it from the siege of \nOchdkov. All these traveling effects of Prince \nAndrew's were in very good order: new, clean, \nand in cloth covers carefully tied with tapes. \n\nWhen starting on a journey or changing \ntheir mode of life, men capable of reflection \nare generally in a serious frame of mind. At \nsuch moments one reviews the past and plans \nfor the future. Prince Andrew's face looked \nvery thoughtful and tender. With his hands \nbehind him he paced briskly from corner to \ncorner of the room, looking straight before him \nand thoughtfully shaking his head. Did he fear \ngoing to the war, or was he sad at leaving his \nwife? perhaps both, but evidently he did not \nwish to be seen in that mood, for hearing foot- \nsteps in the passage he hurriedly unclasped his \nhands, stopped at a table as if tying the cover \nof the small box, and assumed his usual tran- \nquil and impenetrable expression. It was the \nheavy tread of Princess Mary that he heard. \n\n"I hear you have given orders to harness," \nshe cried, panting (she had apparently been \nrunning), "and I did so wish to have another \ntalk with you alone 1 God knows how long we \nmay again be parted. You are not angry with \nme for coming? You have changed so, Andrii- \nsha," she added, as if to explain such a ques- \ntion. \n\nShe smiled as she uttered his pet name, "An- \ndrusha." It was obviously strange to her to \nthink that this stern handsome man should be \nAndnisha the slender mischievous boy who \nhad been her playfellow in childhood. \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\n"And where is Lise?" he asked, answering \nher question only by a smile. \n\n"She was so tired that she has fallen asleep \non the sofa in my room. Oh, Andrew I What a \ntreasure of a wife you have," said she, sitting \ndown on the sofa, facing her brother. "She is \nquite a child: such a dear, merry child. I have \ngrown so fond of her." \n\nPrince Andrew was silent, but the princess \nnoticed the ironical and contemptuous look \nthat showed itself on his face. \n\n"One must be indulgent to littleweaknesses; \nwho is free from them, Andrew? Don't forget \nthat she has grown up and been educated in \nsociety, and so her position now is not a rosy \none. We should enter into everyone's situation. \nToutcomprendre,c'est tout pardonner. 1 Think \nwhat it must be for her, poor thing, after what \nshe has been used to, to be parted from her \nhusband and be left alone in the country, in \nher condition! It's very hard." \n\nPrince Andrew smiled as he looked at his \nsister, as we smile at those we think we thor- \noughly understand. \n\n"You live in the country and don't think the \nlife terrible," he replied. \n\n"I . . . that's different. Why speak of me? I \ndon't want any other life, and can't, for I know \nno other. But think, Andrew: for a young soci- \nety woman to be buried in the country during \nthe best years of her life, all alone for Papa is \nalways busy, and I ... well, you know what \npoor resources I have for entertaining a wom- \nan used to the best society. There is only Made- \nmoiselle Bourienne " \n\n"I don't like your Mademoiselle Bourienne \nat all," said Prince Andrew. \n\n"No? She is very nice and kind and, above \nall, she's much to be pitied. She has no one, no \none. To tell the truth, I don't need her, and \nshe's even in my way. You know I always was \na savage, and now am even more so. I like be- \ning alone. . . . Father likes her very much. She \nand Michael Ivdnovich are the two people to \nwhom he is always gentle and kind, because he \nhas been a benefactor to them both. As Sterne \nsays: 'We don't love people so much for the \ngood they have done us, as for the good we \nhave done them.' Father took her when she was \nhomeless after losing her own father. She is \nvery good-natured, and my father likes her way \nof reading. She reads to him in the evenings \nand reads splendidly." \n\n"To be quite frank, Mary, I expect Father's \ncharacter sometimes makes things trying for \n1 To understand all is to forgive all. \n\n\n\nyou, ^doesn't it?" Prince Andrew asked sud- \ndenly. \n\nPrincess Mary was first surprised and then \naghast at this question. \n\n"For me? For me? , . . Trying for mel . . ." \nsaid she. \n\n"He always was rather harsh; and now I \nshould think he's getting very trying," said \nPrince Andrew, apparently speaking lightly \nof their father in order to puzzle or test his \nsister. \n\n"You are good in every way, Andrew, but \nyou have a kind of intellectual pride," said the \nprincess, following the train of her own thoughts \nrather than the trend of the conversation "and \nthat's a great sin. How can one judge Father? \nBut even if one might, what feeling except \nveneration could such a man as my father \nevoke? And I am so contented and happy with \nhim. I only wish you were all as happy as \nI am." \n\nHer brother shook his head incredulously. \n\n"The only thing that is hard for me ... I \nwill tell you the truth, Andrew ... is Father's \nway of treating religious subjects. I don't un- \nderstand how a man of his immense intellect \ncan fail to see what is as clear as day, and can \ngo so far astray. That is the only thing that \nmakes me unhappy. But even in this I can see \nlately a shade of improvement. His satire has \nbeen less bitter of late, and there was a monk \nhe received and had a long talk with." \n\n"Ah! my dear, I am afraid you and your \nmonk are wasting your powder," said Prince \nAndrew banteringly yet tenderly. \n\n"Ah! mon ami, I only pray, and hope that \nGod will hear me. Andrew . . ." she said timid- \nly after a moment's silence, "I have a great \nfavor to ask of you." \n\n"What is it, dear?" \n\n"No promise that you will not refuse! It \nwill give you no trouble and is nothing un- \nworthy of you, but it will comfort me. Promise, \nAndrusha! . . ." said she, putting her hand in \nher reticule but not yet taking out what she \nwas holding inside it, as if what she held were \nthe subject of her request and must not be \nshown before the request was granted. \n\nShe looked timidly at her brother. \n\n"Even if it were a great deal of trouble . . ." \nanswered Prince Andrew, as if guessing what it \nwas about. \n\n"Think what you please! I know you are just \nlike Father. Think as you please, but do this \nfor my sakel Please do! Father's father, our \ngrandfather, wore it in all his wars." (She still \n\n\n\nBOOK ONE \n\n\n\ndid not take out what she was holding |n her \nreticule.) "So you promise?" \n\n"Of course. What is it?" \n\n"Andrew, I bless you with this icon and you \nmust promise me you will never take it off. Do \nyou promise?" \n\n"If it does not weigh a hundredweight and \nwon't break my neck . . . To please you ..." \nsaid Prince Andrew. But immediately, notic- \ning the pained expression his joke had brought \nto his sister's face, he repented and added: "I \nam glad; really, dear, I am very glad." \n\n"Against your will He will save and have \nmercy on you and bring you to Himself, for in \nHim alone is truth and peace," said she in a \nvoice trembling with emotion, solemnly hold- \ning up in both hands before her brother a \nsmall, oval, antique, dark-faced icon of the \nSaviour in a gold setting, on a finely wrought \nsilver chain. \n\nShe crossed herself, kissed the icon, and \nhanded it to Andrew. \n\n"Please, Andrew, for my sake! . . ." \n\nRays of gentle light shone from her large, \ntimid eyes. Those eyes lit up the whole of her \nthin, sickly face and made it beautiful. Her \nbrother would have taken the icon, but she \nstopped him. Andrew understood, crossed him- \nself and kissed the icon. There was a look of \ntenderness, for he was touched, but also a gleam \nof irony on his face. \n\n"Thank you, my dear." She kissed him on \nthe forehead and sat down again on the sofa. \nThey were silent for a while. \n\n"As I was saying to you, Andrew, be kind \nand generous as you always used to be. Don't \njudge Lise harshly," she began. "She is so sweet, \nso good-natured, and her position now is a very \nhard one." \n\n"I do not think I have complained of my \nwife to you, Masha, or blamed her. Why do \nyou say all this to me?" \n\nRed patches appeared on Princess Mary's \nface and she was silent as if she felt guilty. \n\n"I have said nothing to you, but you have \nalready been talked to. And I am sorry for \nthat," he went on. \n\nThe patches grew deeper on her forehead, \nneck, and cheeks. She tried to say something \nbut could not. Her brother had guessed right: \nthe little princess had been crying after dinner \nand had spoken of her forebodings about her \nconfinement, and how she dreaded it, and had \ncomplained of her fate, her father-in-law, and \nher husband. After cry ing she had fallen asleep. \nPrince Andrew felt sorry for his sister. \n\n\n\n57 \n\n\n\n"Know this, Mdsha: I can't reproach, have \nnot reproached, and never shall reproach my \nwife with anything, and I cannot reproach my- \nself with anything in regard to her; and that \nalways will be so in whatever circumstances \nI may be placed. But if you want to know the \ntruth ... if you want to know whether I am \nhappy? No! Is she happy? No! But why this is \nso I don't know . . ." \n\nAs he said this he rose, went to his sister, and, \nstooping, kissed her forehead. His fine eyes lit \nup with a thoughtful, kindly, and unaccus- \ntomed brightness, but he was looking not at \nhis sister but over her head toward the dark- \nness of the open doorway. \n\n"Let us go to her, I must say good-by. Or \ngo and wake her, and I'll come in a moment. \nPetrushka!" he called to his valet: "Come here, \ntake these away. Put this on the seat and this \nto the right." \n\nPrincess Mary rose and moved to the door, \nthen stopped and said: "Andrew, if you had \nfaith you would have turned to God and \nasked Him to give you the love you do not \nfeel, and your prayer would have been an- \nswered." \n\n"Well, may be!" said Prince Andrew. "Go, \nMasha; I'll come immediately." \n\nOn the way to his sister's room, in the pas- \nsage which connected one wing with the other, \nPrince Andrew met Mademoiselle Bourienne \nsmiling sweetly. It was the third time that day \nthat, with an ecstatic and artless smile, she had \nmet him in secluded passages. \n\n"Oh! I thought you were in your room," she \nsaid, for some reason blushing and dropping \nher eyes. \n\nPrince Andrew looked sternly at her and an \nexpression of anger suddenly came over his \nface. He said nothing to her but looked at her \nforehead and hair, without looking at her eyes, \nwith such contempt that the Frenchwoman \nblushed and went away without a word. When \nhe reached his sister's room his wife was al- \nready awake and her merry voice, hurrying \none word after another, came through the open \ndoor. She was speaking as usual in French, and \nas if after long self-restraint she wished to make \nup for lost time. \n\n"No, but imagine the old Countess Zubova, 1 \nwith false curls and her mouth full of false \nteeth, as if she were trying to cheat old age. \n... Ha, ha, ha! Mary!" \n\nThis very sentence about Countess Ziibova \n\n1 The word zub means tooth, and a pun on this \nis intended. TR. \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nand this same laugh Prince Andrew had al- \nready heard from his wife in the presence of \nothers some five times. He entered the room \nsoftly. The little princess, plump and rosy, \nwas sitting in an easy chair with her work \nin her hands, talking incessantly, repeating \nPetersburg reminiscences and even phrases. \nPrince Andrew came up, stroked her hair, \nand asked if she felt rested after their jour- \nney. She answered him and continued her \nchatter. \n\nThe coach with six horses was waiting at the \nporch. It was an autumn night, so dark that \nthe coachman could not see the carriage pole. \nServants with lanterns were bustling about in \nthe porch. The immense house was brilliant \nwith lights shining through its lofty windows. \nThe domestic serfs were crowding in the hall, \nwaiting to bid good-by to the young prince. \nThe members of the household were all gath- \nered in the reception hall: Michael Ivdnovich, \nMademoiselle Bourienne, Princess Mary, and \nthe little princess. Prince Andrew had been \ncalled to his father's study as the latter wished \nto say good-by to him alone. All were waiting \nfor them to come out. \n\nWhen Prince Andrew entered the study the \nold man in his old-age spectacles and white \ndressing gown, in which he received no one but \nhis son, sat at the table writing. He glanced \nround. \n\n"Going?" And he went on writing. \n\n"I've come to say good-by." \n\n"Kiss me here," and he touched his cheek: \n"Thanks, thanks!" \n\n"What do you thank me for?" \n\n"For not dilly-dallying and not hanging to a \nwoman's apron strings. The Service before \neverything. Thanks, thanks!" And he went on \nwriting, so that his quill spluttered and \nsqueaked. "If you have anything to say, say it. \nThese two things can be done together," he \nadded. \n\n"About my wife ... I am ashamed as it is to \nleave her on your hands. . . ." \n\n"Why talk nonsense? Say what you want." \n\n"When her confinement is due, send to \nMoscow for an accoucheur. . . . Let him be \nhere " \n\nThe old prince stopped writing and, as if \nnot understanding, fixed his stern eyes on his \nson. \n\n"I know that no one can help if nature does \nnot do her work/' said Prince Andrew, evident- \nly confused. "I know that out of a million cases \nonly one goes wrong, but it is her fancy and \n\n\n\nmine. They have been telling her things. She \nhas had a dream and is frightened." \n\n"Hm . . . Hm . . ." muttered the old prince \nto himself, finishing what he was writing. "I'll \ndo it." \n\nHe signed with a flourish and suddenly turn- \ning to his son began to laugh. \n\n"It's a bad business, eh?" \n\n"What is bad, Father?" \n\n"The wife!" said the old prince, briefly and \nsignificantly. \n\n"I don't understand!" said Prince Andrew. \n\n"No, it can't be helped, lad," said the prince. \n"They're all like that; one can't unmarry. Don't \nbe afraid; I won't tell anyone, but you know it \nyourself." \n\nHe seized his son by the hand with small \nbony fingers, shook it, looked straight into his \nson's face with keen eyes which seemed to see \nthrough him, and again laughed his frigid \nlaugh. \n\nThe son sighed, thus admitting that his fa- \nther had understood him. The old man con- \ntinued to fold and seal his letter, snatching up \nand throwing down the wax, the seal, and the \npaper, with his accustomed rapidity. \n\n"What's to be done? She's pretty! I will do \neverything. Make your mind easy," said he in \nabrupt sentences while sealing his letter. \n\nAndrew did not speak; he was both pleased \nand displeased that his father understood him. \nThe old man got up and gave the letter to his \nson. \n\n"Listen!" said he; "don't worry about your \nwife: what can be done shall be. Now listen! \nGive this letter to Michael Ilaridnovich. 1 1 have \nwritten that he should make use of you in \nproper places and not keep you long as an ad- \njutant: a bad position! Tell him I remember \nand like him. Write and tell me how he re- \nceives you. If he is all right serve him. Nich- \nolas Bolk6nski's son need not serve under any- \none if he is in disfavor. Now come here." \n\nHe spoke so rapidly that he did not finish \nhalf his words, but his son was accustomed J;o \nunderstand him. He led him to the desk, raised \nthe lid, drew out a drawer, and took out ati \nexercise book filled with his bold, tall, close \nhandwriting. \n\n"I shall probably die before you. So remem- \nber, these are my memoirs; hand them to the \nEmperor after my death. Now here is a Lom- \nbard bond and a letter; it is a premium for the \nman who writes a history of Suv6rov's wars. \nSend it to the Academy. Here are some jottings \n\n1 Kutiizov. \n\n\n\nBOOK ONE \n\n\n\n59 \n\n\n\nfor you to read when I am gone. You w Jl find \nthem useful/' \n\nAndrew did not tell his father that he would \nno doubt live a long time yet. He felt that he \nmust not say it. \n\n"I will do it all, Father," he said. \n\n"Well, now, good-by!" He gave his son his \nhand to kiss, and embraced him. "Remember \nthis, Prince Andrew, if they kill you it will hurt \nme, your old father . . ." he paused unexpected- \nly, and then in a querulous voice suddenly \nshrieked: "but if I hear that you have not be- \nhaved like a son of Nicholas Bolk6nski, I shall \nbe ashamed I" \n\n"You need not have said that to me, Father," \nsaid the son with a smile. \n\nThe old man was silent. \n\n"I also wanted to ask you," continued Prince \nAndrew, "if I'm killed and if I have a son, do \nnot let him be taken away from you as I said \nyesterday ... let him grow up with you. . . . \nPlease." \n\n"Not let the wife have him?" said the old \nmart, and laughed. \n\nThey stood silent, facing one another. The \nold man's sharp eyes were fixed straight on his \nson's. Something twitched in the lower part of \nthe old prince's face. \n\n"We've said good-by. Gol" he suddenly \nshouted in a loud, angry voice, opening his \ndoor. \n\n"What is it? What?" asked both princesses \nwhen they saw for a moment at the door Prince \nAndrew and the figure of the old man in a \n\n\n\nwhite dressing gown, spectacled and wigless, \nshouting in an angry voice. \n\nPrince Andrew sighed and made no reply. \n\n"Well!" he said, turning to his wife. \n\nAnd this "Well!" sounded coldly ironic, as \nif he were saying: "Now go through your per- \nformance." \n\n"Andrew, already!" said the little princess, \nturning pale and looking with dismay at her \nhusband. \n\nHe embraced her. She screamed and fell un- \nconscious on his shoulder. \n\nHe cautiously released the shoulder she \nleaned on, looked into her face, and carefully \nplaced her in an easy chair. \n\n"Adieu, Mary," said he gently to his sister, \ntaking her by the hand and kissing her, and \nthen he left the room with rapid steps. \n\nThe little princess lay in the armchair, Ma- \ndemoiselle Bourienne chafing her temples. \nPrincess Mary, supporting her sister-in-law, still \nlooked with her beautiful eyes full of tears at \nthe door through which Prince Andrew had \ngone and made the sign of the cross in his di- \nrection. From the study, like pistol shots, came \nthe frequent sound of the old man angrily \nblowing his nose. Hardly had Prince Andrew \ngone when the study door opened quickly and \nthe stern figure of the old man in the white \ndressing gown looked out. \n\n"Gone? That's all right!" said he; and look- \ning angrily at the unconscious little princess, \nhe shook his head reprovingly and slammed \nthe door. \n\n\n\nBook Two: 1805 \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I \n\nIN OCTOBER, 1805, a Russian army was occupy- \ning the villages and towns of the Archduchy of \nAustria, and yet other regiments freshly arriv- \ning from Russia were settling near the fortress \nof Braunau and burdening the inhabitants on \nwhom they were quartered. Braunau was the \nheadquarters of thecommander-in-chief, Kutii- \nzov. \n\nOn October 11, 1805, one of the infantry \nregiments that had just reached Braunau had \nhalted half a mile from the town, waiting to be \ninspected by the commander in chief. Despite \nthe un-Russian appearance of the locality and \nsurroundings fruit gardens, stone fences, tiled \nroofs, and hills in the distance and despite \nthe fact that the inhabitants (who gazed with \ncuriosity at the soldiers) were not Russians, the \nregiment had just the appearance of any Rus- \nsian regiment preparing for an inspection any- \nwhere in the heart of Russia. \n\nOn the evening of the last day's march an or- \nder had been received that the commander in \nchief would inspect the regiment on the march. \nThough the words of the order were not clear \nto the regimental commander, and the ques- \ntion arose whether the troops were to be in \nmarching order or not, it was decided at a con- \nsultation between the battalion commanders \nto present the regiment in parade order, on the \nprinciple that it is always better to "bow too \nlow than not bow low enough." So the soldiers, \nafter a twenty-mile march, were kept mefl iing \nand cleaning all night long without closing \ntheir eyes, while the adjutants and company \ncommanders calculated and reckoned, and by \nmorning the regiment instead of the strag- \ngling, disorderly crowd it had been on its last \nmarch the day before presented a well-or- \ndered array of two thousand men each of whom \nknew his place and his duty, had every button \nand every strap in place, and shone with clean- \nliness. And not only externally was all in or- \nder, but had it pleased the commander in chief \nto look under the uniforms he would have \n\n\n\nfound on every man a clean shirt, and in every \nknapsack the appointed number of articles, \n"awl, soap, and all," as the soldiers say. There \nwas only one circumstance concerning which \nno one could be at ease. It was the state of the \nsoldiers' boots. More than half the men's boots \nwere in holes. But this defect was not due to \nany fault of the regimental commander, for in \nspite of repeated demands boots had not been \nissued by the Austrian commissariat, and the \nregiment had marched some seven hundred \nmiles. \n\nThe commander of the regiment was an eld- \nerly, choleric, stout, and thick-set general with \ngrizzled eyebrows and whiskers, and wider from \nchest to back than across the shoulders. He had \non a brand-new uniform showing the creases \nwhere it had been folded and thick gold epau- \nlettes which seemed to stand rather than lie \ndown on his massive shoulders. He had the air \nof a man happily performing one of the most \nsolemn duties of his life. He walked about in \nfront of the line and at every step pulled him- \nself up, slightly arching his back. It was plain \nthat the commander admired his regiment, re- \njoiced in it, and that his whole mind was en- \ngrossed by it, yet his strut seemed to indicate \nthat, besides military matters, social interests \narid the fair sex occupied no small part of his \nthoughts. \n\n"Well, Michael Mftrich, sir?" he said, ad- \ndressing one of the battalion commanders who \nsmilingly pressed forward (it was plain that \nthey both felt happy). "We had our hands full \nlast night. However, I think the regiment is \nnot a bad one, eh?" \n\nThe battalion commander perceived the jo- \nvial irony and laughed. \n\n"It would not be turned off the field even on \nthe Tsaritsin Meadow." * \n\n"What?" asked the commander. \n\nAt that moment, on the road from the town \non which signalers had been posted, two men \n\n1 The Tsaritsin Meadow, in St. Petersburg, was \nused for parades and reviews. TR. \n\n\n\nBOOK TWO \n\n\n\n61 \n\n\n\nappeared on horse back. They were an aule-de- \ncamp followed by a Cossack. \n\nThe aide-de-camp was sent to confirm the \norder which had not been clearly worded the \nday before, namely, that the commander in \nchief wished to see the regiment just in the \nstate in which it had been on the march: in \ntheir greatcoats, and packs, and without any \npreparation whatever. \n\nA member of the Hofkriegsrath from Vienna \nhad come to Kutuzov the day before with pro- \nposals and demands for him to join up with \nthe army of the Archduke Ferdinand and \nMack, and Kutiizov, not considering this junc- \ntion advisable, meant, among other arguments \nin support of his view, to show the Austrian \ngeneral the wretched state in which the troops \narrived from Russia. With this object he in- \ntended to meet the regiment; so the worse the \ncondition it was in, the better pleased the com- \nmander in chief would be. Though the aide- \nde-camp did not know these circumstances, he \nnevertheless delivered the definite order that \nthe men should be in their greatcoats and in \nmarching order, and that the commander in \nchief would otherwise be dissatisfied. On hear- \ning this the regimental commander hung his \nhead, silently shrugged his shoulders, and \nspread out his arms with a choleric gesture. \n\n"A fine mess we've made of it!" he remarked. \n\n"There now! Didn't I tell you, Michael Mit- \nrich, that if it was said 'on the march' it meant \nin greatcoats?" said he reproachfully to the \nbattalion commander. "Oh, my God!" he ladd- \ned, stepping resolutely forward. "Company \ncommanders! " he shouted in a voice accustomed \nto comamnd. "Sergeants major! . . . How soon \nwill he be here?" he asked the aide-de-camp \nwith a respectful politeness evidently relating \nto the personage he was referring to. \n\n"In an hour's time, I should say." \n\n"Shall we have time to change clothes?" \n\n"I don't know, General " \n\nThe regimental commander, going up to the \nline himself, ordered the soldiers to change in- \nto their greatcoats. The company commanders \nran off to their companies, the sergeants major \nbegan bustling (the greatcoats were not in very \ngood condition), and instantly the squares that \nhad up to then been in regular order and si- \nlent began to sway and stretch and hum with \nvoices. On all sides soldiers were running to \nand fro, throwing up their knapsacks with a \njerk of their shoulders and pulling the straps \nover their heads, unstrapping their overcoats \nand drawing the sleeves on with upraised arms. \n\n\n\nIn half an hour all was again in order, only \nthe squares had become gray instead of black. \nThe regimental commander walked with his \njerky steps to the front of the regiment and \nexamined it from a distance. \n\n"Whatever is this? This!" he shouted and \nstood still. "Commander of the third com- \npany!" \n\n"Commander of the third company wanted \nby the general! . . . commander to the^getreral \n. . . third company to the commander.'/ The \nwords passed along the lines and an adjutant \nran to look for the missing officer. \n\nWhen the eager but misrepeated words had \nreached their destination in a cry of: "The \ngeneral to the third company," the njissing of- \nficer appeared from behind his company and, \nthough he was a middle-aged man and not in \nthe habit of running, trotted awkwardly stum- \nbling on his toes toward the general. The cap- \ntain's face showed the uneasiness of a school- \nboy who is told to repeat a lesson he has not \nlearned. Spots appeared on his nose, the red- \nness of which was evidently due to intemper- \nance, and his mouth twitched nervously. The \ngenera$lboked the captain up and down as he \ncarne up panting, slackening his pace as he ap- \nproached. \n\n"You will soon be dressing your men in pet- \nticoats! What is this?" shouted the regimental \ncommander, thrusting forward his jaw and \npointing at a soldier in the ranks of the third \ncompany in a greatcoat of bluish cloth, which \ncontrasted with the others. "What have you \nbeen after? The commander in chief is ex- \npected and you leave your place? Eh? I'll teach \nyou to dress the men in fancy coats for a \nparade. . . . Eh . . . ?" \n\nThe commander of the company, with his \neyes fixed on his superior, pressed two fingers \nmore and more rigidly to his cap, as if in this \npres&amp;ure lay his only hope of salvation. \n\n"\4jiell, why don't you speak? Whom have \nyou^got there dressed up as a Hungarian?" \nsaid the commander with an austere gibe. \n\n"Your excellency . . ." \n\n"Well, your excellency, what? Your excel- \nlency! But what about your excellency? . . . no- \nbody knows." \n\n"Your excellency, it's the officer Dolokhov, \nwho has been reduced to the ranks," said the \ncaptain softly. \n\n"Well? Has he been degraded into a field \nmarshal, or into a soldier? If a soldier, he should \nbe dressed in regulation uniform like the oth- \ners." \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\n"Your excellency, you gave him leave your- \nself, on the march." \n\n"Gave him leave? Leave? That's just like you \nyoung men," said the regimental commander \ncooling down a little. "Leave indeed. . . . One \nsays a word to you and you . . . What?" he added \nwith renewed irritation, "I beg you to dress \nyouffnen decently." \n\nAnd the commander, turning to look at the \nadfBifcfitr directed his jerky steps down the \nline. JHe was evidently pleased at his own dis- \nplay of anger and walking up to the regiment \nwished to find a further excuse for wrath. Hav- \ning snapped at an officer for an unpolished \nbadge, at another because his line was not \nstraigt&amp;jhe reached the third company. \n\n"H-o-o-w are you standing? Where's your \nleg? Your leg?" shouted the cdfmnander with a \ntone of suffering in his voice, while there were \nstill five men between him and D61okhov with \nhis bluish-gray uniform. \n\nD61okhov slowly straightened his bent knee, \nlookii'ijf straight with his clear, insolent eyes in \nthe general's faceiy \n\n"Why a blue toat? Off with it":*' . Sergeant \nmajor! Change his coat . . . the ras ^Wl^did \nnot finish. \n\n"General, I must obey orders, but I am not \nbound to endure . . ." D61okhov hurriedly in- \nterrupted. \n\n"No talking in the ranks! . . . No talking, no \ntalking!" \n\n"Not bound to endure insults," D61okhov \nconcluded in loud, ringing tones. \n\nThe eyes of the general and the soldier met. \nThe general became silent, angrily pulling \ndown his tight scarf. \n\n"I request you to have the goodness to change \nyour coat," he said as he turned away. \n\nCHAPTER II \n\n"HE'S COMING!" shouted the signaler at that \nmoment. \n\nThe regimental commander, flushing, ran to \nhis horse, seized the stirrup with trembling \nhands, threw his body across the saddle, righted \nhimlelf, drew his saber, and with a happy and \nresolute countenance, opening his mouth awry, \nprepared to shout. The regiment fluttered like \na bird preening its plumage and became mo- \ntionless. \n\n"Att-ention!" shouted the regimental com- \nmander in a soul-shaking voice which expressed \njoy for himself, severity for the regiment, and \nwelcome for the approaching chief. \n\nAlong the broad country road, edged on \n\n\n\nbotty sides by trees, came a high, light blue Vi- \nennese caliche, slightly creaking on its springs \nand drawn by six horses at a smart trot. Be- \nhind the caliche galloped the suite and a con- \nvoy of Croats. Beside Kutuzov sat an Austrian \ngeneral, in a white uniform that looked strange \namong the Russian black ones. The caliche \nstopped in front of the regiment. Kutiizov and \nthe Austrian general were talking in low voices \nand Kutuzov smiled slightly as treading heavi- \nly he stepped down from the carriage just as if \nthose two thousand men breathlessly gazing at \nhim and the regimental commander did not \nexist. \n\nThe word of command rang out, and again \nthe regiment quivered, as with a jingling sound \nit presented arms. Then amidst a dead silence \nthe feeble voice of the commander in chief was \nheard. The regiment roared, "Health to your \nex ... len . . . len . . . lency!" and again all be- \ncame silent. At first Kutuzov stood still while \nthe regiment moved; then he and the general \nin white, accompanied by the suite, walked be- \ntween the ranks. \n\nFrom the way the regimental commander sa- \nluted the commander in chief and devoured him \nwith his eyes, drawing himself up obsequiously, \nand from the way he walked through the ranks \nbehind the generals, bending forward and \nhardly able to restrain his jerky movements, \nand from the way he darted forward at every \nword or gesture of the commander in chief, it \nwas evident that he performed his duty as a \nsubordinate with even greater zeal than his \nduty as a commander. Thanks to the strictness \nand assiduity of its commander the regiment, in \ncomparison with others that had reached Brau- \nnau at the same time, was in splendid condi- \ntion. There were only 217 sick and stragglers. \nEverything was in good order except the boots. \n\nKutuzov walked through the ranks, some- \ntimes stopping to say a few friendly words to \nofficers he had known in the Turkish war, some- \ntimes also to the soldiers. Looking at their boots \nhe several times shook his head sadly, pointing \nthem out to the Austrian general with an ex- \npression which seemed to say that he was not \nblaming anyone, but could not help noticing \nwhat a bad state of things it was. The regimen- \ntal commander ran forward on each such occa- \nsion, fearing to miss a single word of the com- \nmander in chief's regarding the regiment. Be- \nhind Kutiizov, at a distance that allowed every \nsoftly spoken word to be heard, followed some \ntwenty men of his suite. These gentlemen \ntalked among themselves and sometimes \n\n\n\nBOOK \n\nlaughed. Nearest of all to the comma Ader in \nchief walked a handsome adjutant. This was \nPrince Bolk6nski. Beside him was his comrade \nNesvftski, a tall staff officer, extremely stout, \nwith a kindly, smiling, handsome face and \nmoist eyes. Nesvitski could hardly keep from \nlaughter provoked by a swarthy hussar officer \nwho walked beside him. This hussar, with a \ngrave face and without a smile or a change in \nthe expression of his fixed eyes, watched the \nregimental commander's back and mimicked \nhis every movement. Each time the commander \nstarted and bent forward, the hussar started \nand bent forward in exactly the same manner. \nNesvitski laughed and nudged the others to \nmake them look at the wag. \n\nKutuzov walked slowly and languidly past \nthousands of eyes which were starting from \ntheir sockets to watch their chief. On reaching \nthe third company he suddenly stopped. His \nsuite, not having expected this, involuntarily \ncame closer to him. \n\n"Ah, Tim6khinl" said he, recognizing the \nred-nosed captain who had been reprimanded \non account of the blue greatcoat. \n\nOne would have thought it impossible for a \nman to stretch himself more than Tim6khin \nhad done when he was reprimanded by the \nregimental commander, but now that the com- \nmander in chief addressed him he drew him- \nself up to such an extent that it seemed he \ncould not have sustained it had the commander \nin chief continued to look at him, and so Ku- \ntuzov, who evidently understood his case and \nwished him nothing but good, quickly turned \naway, a scarcely perceptible smile flitting over \nhis scarred and puffy face. \n\n"Another Ismail comrade/' said he. "A brave \nofficer! Are you satisfied with him?" he asked \nthe regimental commander. \n\nAnd the latter unconscious that he was be- \ning reflected in the hussar officer as in a look- \ning glass started, moved forward, and an- \nswered: "Highly satisfied, your excellency!" \n\n"We all have our weaknesses," said Kutuzov \nsmiling and walking away from him. "He used \nto have a predilection for Bacchus." \n\nThe regimental commander was afraid he \nmight be blamed for this and did not answer. \nThe hussar at that moment noticed the face of \nthe red-nosed captain and his drawn-in stom- \nach, and mimicked his expression and pose \nwith such exactitude that Nesvftski could not \nhelp laughing. Kutiizov turned round. The \nofficer evidently had complete control of his \nface, and while Kutiazov was turning managed \n\n\n\nTWO 63 \n\nto make a grimace and then assume a most seri- \nous, deferential, and innocent expression. \n\nThe third company was the last, and Kutu- \nzov pondered, apparently trying to recollect \nsomething. Prince Andrew stepped forward \nfrom among the suite and said softly in French: \n\n"You told me to remind you of the officer \nD61okhov, reduced to the ranks in this regi- \nment." -xflfeNMl \n\n"Where is D61okhov?" asked Kutuzov. \n\nD61okhov, who had already changed into a \nsoldier's gray greatcoat, did not wait to be \ncalled. The shapely figure of the fair-haired sol- \ndier, with his clear blue eyes, stepped forward \nfrom the ranks, went up to the commander in \nchief, and presented arms. *&amp;*** \n\n"Have yoi%j|fr complaint to make?" Kuttizov \nasked with^a slight frown. \n\n"This is D61okhov," said Prince Andrew. \n\n"Ah!" said Kutuzov. "I hope this will be a \nlesson to you. Do your duty. The Emperor is \ngracious, and I shan't forget you if you deserve \nwell." \n\nThe clejtf.blue eyes looked at the commander' \nin chi|jgust as boldly as they had looked at the \n^gftnental commander, seeming by their ex- \npression to tear open the veil of convention \nthat separates a commander in chief so widely \nfrom a private. \n\n"One thing I ask of your excellency," D61o- \nkhov said in his firm, ringing, deliberate voice. \n"I ask an opportunity to atone for my fault and \nprove my devotion to His Majesty the Emper- \nor and to Russia!" \n\nKutuzov turned away. The same smile of the \neyes with which he had turned from Captain \nTim6khin again flitted over his face. He turned \naway with a grimace as if to say that everything \nD61okhov had said to him and everything he \ncould say had long been known to him, that he \nwas weary of it and it was not at all what he \nwanted. He turned away and went to the car- \nriage. \n\nThe regiment broke up into companies, \nwhich went to their appointed quarters near \nBraunau, where they hoped to receive boots and \nclothes and to rest after their hard marches. \n\n"You won't bear me a grudge, Prokh6r Ig- \nnatych?"said the regimental commander, over- \ntaking the third company on its way to its \nquarters and riding up to Captain Tim6khin \nwho was walking in front. (The regimental \ncommander's face now that the inspection was \nhappily over beamed with irrepressible de- \nlight.) "It's in the Emperor's service ... it can't \nbe helped . . . one is sometimes a bit hasty on \n\n\n\n6 4 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nparade ... I am the first to apologize, you know \nme! . . . He was very pleased!" And he held out \nhis hand to the captain. \n\n"Don't mention it, General, as if I'd be so \nbold!" replied the captain, his nose growing \nredder as he gave a smile which showed where \ntwo front teeth were missing that had been \nknocked out by the butt end of a gun at Ismail. \n\n"AfldLtf 11 Mr. D61okhov that I won't forget \nhinffnTmay be quite easy. And tell me, please \nI've been meaning to askhow is he behaving \nhimself, and in general ..." \n\n"As far as theservice goes he is quite punctil- \nious, your excellency; but his character . . ."said \nTimokhin. \n\n"And what about his character?" asked the \nregimental commander. ^ \n\n"It's different on different days," answered \nthe captain. "One day he is sensible, well edu- \ncated, and good-natured, and the next he's a \nwild beast In Poland, if you please, he near- \nly killed a Jew." \n\n"Oh, well, well!" remarked the regimental \ncommander. "Still, one must have pity on a \nyoung man in misfortune. You know he has \nimportant connections . . . Well, theft*, you \njust ..." \n\n"I will, your excellency," said Timokhin, \nshowing by his smile that he understood his \ncommander's wish. \n\n"Well, of course, of course!" \n\nThe regimental commander sought out D6- \nlokhov in the ranks and, reining in his horse, \nsaid to him: \n\n"After the next affair . . . epaulettes." \n\nD61okhov looked round but did not say any- \nthing, nor did the mocking smile on his lips \nchange. \n\n"Well, that's all right," continued the regi- \nmental commander. "A cup of vodka for the \nmen from me/' he added so that the soldiers \ncould hear. "I thank you all! God be praised!" \nand he rode past that company and overtook \nthe next one. \n\n"Well, he's really a good fellow, one can \nserve under him," said Tim6khin to the subal- \ntern beside him. \n\n"In a word, a hearty one . . ." said the subal- \ntern, laughing (the regimental commander was \nnicknamed King of Hearts). \n\nThe cheerful mood of their officers after the \ninspection infected the soldiers. The company \nmarched on gaily. The soldiers' voices could be \nheard on every side. \n\n"And they said Kutiizov was blind of one \neye?" \n\n\n\n"Arid so he is! Quite blind!" \n\n"No, friend, he is sharper-eyed than you \nare. Boots and leg bands ... he noticed every- \nthing . . ." \n\n"When he looked at my feet, friend . . . well, \nthinks I ..." \n\n"And that other one with him, the Austrian, \nlooked as if he were smeared with chalk as \nwhite as flour! I suppose they polish him up as \nthey do the guns." \n\n"I say, F^deshon! . . . Did he say when the \nbattles are to begin? You were near him. Ev- \nerybody said that Buonaparte himself was at \nBraunau." \n\n"Buonaparte himself! . . . Just listen to the \nfool, what he doesn't know! The Prussians are \nup in arms now. The Austrians, you see, are \nputting them down. When they've been put \ndown, the war with Buonaparte will begin. \nAnd he says Buonaparte is in Braunau! Shows \nyou're a fool. You'd better listen more careful- \n\n" \n\n"What devils these quartermasters are! See, \nthe fifth company is turning into the village \nalready . . . they will have their buckwheat \ncooked before we reach our quarters." \n\n"Give me a biscuit, you devil!" \n\n"And did you give me tobacco yesterday? \nThat's just it, friend! Ah, well, never mind, \nhere you are." \n\n"They might call a halt here or we'll have to \ndo another four miles without eating." \n\n"Wasn't it fine when those Germans gave us \nlifts! You just sit still and are drawn along." \n\n"And here, friend, the people are quite beg- \ngarly. There they all seemed to be Poles all \nunder the Russian crown but here they're all \nregular Germans." \n\n"Singers to the front!" came the captain's or- \nder. \n\nAnd from the different ranks some twenty \nmen ran to the front. A drummer, their leader, \nturned round facing the singers, and flourishing \nhis arm, began a long-drawn-out soldiers' song, \ncommencing with the words: "Morning \ndawned, the sun was rising" arid concluding: \n"On then, brothers, on to glory, led by Father \nKdmenski" This song had been composed in \nthe Turkish campaign and was now being sung \nin Austria, the only change being that the words \n"Father Kdmenski" were replaced by "Father \nKutiizov." \n\nHaving jerked out these last words as soldiers \ndo and waved his arms as if flinging something \nto the ground, the drummer a lean, handsome \nsoldier of fortylooked sternly at the singers \n\n\n\nBOOK TWO \n\n\n\nand screwed up his eyes. Then having satisfied \nhimself that all eyes were fixed on him, he \nraised both arms as if carefully lifting some in- \nvisible but precious object above his head and, \nholding it there for some seconds, suddenly \nflung it down and began: \n\n"Oh, my bower, oh, my bower . . ./" \n\n"Oh, my bower new . . ./" chimed in twenty \nvoices, and the Castanet player, in spite of the \nburden of his equipment, rushed out to the \nfront and, walking backwards before the com- \npany, jerked his shoulders and flourished his \ncastanets as if threatening someone. The sol- \ndiers, swinging their arms and keeping time \nspontaneously, marched with long steps. Be- \nhind the company the sound of wheels, the \ncreaking of springs, and the tramp of horses' \nhoofs were heard. Kutuzov and his suite were \nreturning to the town. The commander in chief \nmade a sign that the men should continue to \nmarch at ease, and he and all his suite showed \npleasure at the sound of the singing and the \nsight of the dancing soldier and the gay and \nsmartly marching men. In the second file from \nthe right flank, beside which the carriage \npassed the company, a blue-eyed soldier invol- \nuntarily attracted notice. It was D61okhov \nmarching with particular grace and boldness \nin time to the song and looking at those driv- \ning past as if he pitied all who were not at that \nmoment marching with the company. The hus- \nsar cornet of Kutuzov's suite who had mim- \nicked the regimental commander, fell back \nfrom the carriage and rode up to D61okhov. \n\nHussar cornet Zherk6v had at one time, in \nPetersburg, belonged to the wild set led by \nD61okhov. Zherk6v had met D61okhov abroad \nas a private and had not seen fit to recognize \nhim. But now that Kutuzov had spoken to the \ngentleman ranker, he addressed him with the \ncordiality of an old friend. \n\n"My dear fellow, how are you?" said he \nthrough the singing, making his horse keep \npace with the company. \n\n"How am I?" D61okhov answered coldly. "I \nam as you see." \n\nThe lively song gave a special flavor to the \ntone of free and easv gaiety with which Zher- \nk6v spoke, and to the intentional coldness of \nD61okhov's reply. \n\n"And how do you get on with the officers?" \ninquired Zherk6v. \n\n"All right. They are good fellows. And how \nhave you wriggled onto the staff?" \n\n"I was attached; I'm on duty." \n\nBoth were silent. \n\n\n\n"She let the hawk fly upward from her wide \nright sleeve" went the song, arousing an invol- \nuntary sensation of courage and cheerfulness. \nTheir conversation would probably have been \ndifferent but for the effect of that song. \n\n"Is it true that Austrians have been beaten?" \nasked D61okhov. \n\n"The devil only knowsl They say so." \n\n"I'm glad," answered D61okhov briefly and \nclearly, as the song demanded. \n\n"I say, come round some evening and we'll \nhave a game of farol" said Zherk6v. \n\n"Why, have you too much money?" \n\n"Do come." \n\n"I can't. I've sworn not to. I won't drink and \nwon't play till I get reinstated." \n\n"Well, that's only till the first engagement." \n\n"We shall see." \n\nThey were again silent. \n\n"Come if you need anything. One can at least \nbe of use on the staff . . ." \n\nD61okhov smiled. "Don't trouble. If I want \nanything, I won't beg I'll take itl" \n\n"Well, never mind; I only . . ." \n\n"And I only . . ." \n\n"Good-by." \n\n"Good health . . ." \n\n"It's a long, long way \nTo my native land . . ." \n\nZherkov touched his horse with the spurs; it \npranced excitedly from foot to foot uncertain \nwith which to start, then settled down, galloped \npast the company, and overtook the carriage, \nstill keeping time to the song. \n\nCHAPTER III \n\nON RETURNING from the review, Kutuzov took \nthe Austrian general into his private room and, \ncalling his adjutant, asked for some papers re- \nlating to the condition of the troops on their \narrival, and the letters that had come from the \nArchduke Ferdinand, who was in command of \nthe advanced army. Prince Andrew Bolk6nski \ncame into the room with the required papers. \nKutuzov and the Austrian member of the Hof- \nkriegsrath were sitting at the table on which a \nplan was spread out. \n\n"Ahl . . ." said Kutuzov glancing at Bolk6n- \nski as if by this exclamation he was asking the \nadjutant to wait, and he went on with the con- \nversation in French. \n\n"All I can say, General," said he with a pleas- \nant elegance of expression and intonation that \nobliged one to listen to each deliberately spok- \nen word. It was evident that Kutiizov himself \n\n\n\n66 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nlistened with pleasure to his own voice. "All I \ncan say, General, is that if the matter depend- \ned on my personal wishes, the will of His Maj- \nesty the Emperor Francis would have been ful- \nfilled long ago. I should long ago have joined \nthe archduke. And believe me on my honor \nthat to me personally it would be a pleasure to \nhand over the supreme command of the army \ninto the hands of a better informed and more \nskillful generalof whom Austria has so many \nand to lay down all this heavy responsibility. \nBut circumstances are sometimes too strong for \nus, General." \n\nAnd Kutuzov smiled in a way that seemed to \nsay, "You are quite at liberty not to believe \nme and I don't even care whether you do or \nnot, but you have no grounds for telling me so. \nAnd that is the whole point." \n\nThe Austrian general looked dissatisfied, but \nhad no option but to reply in the same tone. \n\n"On the contrary," he said, in a querulous \nand angry tone that contrasted with his flatter- \ning words, "on the contrary, your excellency's \nparticipation in the common action is highly \nvalued by His Majesty; but we think the pres- \nent delay is depriving the splendid Russian \ntroops and their commander of the laurels they \nhave been accustomed to win in their battles," \nhe concluded his evidently prearranged sen- \ntence. \n\nKutuzov bowed with the same smile. \n\n"But that is my conviction, and judging by \nthe last letter with which His Highness the \nArchduke Ferdinand has honored me, I imag- \nine that the Austrian troops, under the direc- \ntion of so skillful a leader as General Mack, \nhave by now already gained a decisive victory \nand no longer need our aid," said Kutuzov. \n\nThe general frowned. Though there was no \ndefinite news of an Austrian defeat, there were \nmany circumstances confirming the unfavor- \nable rumors that were afloat, and so Kutuzov's \nsuggestion of an Austrian victory sounded much \nlike irony. But Kutuzov went on blandly smil- \ning with the same expression, which seemed to \nsay that he had a right to suppose so. And, in \nfact, the last letter he had received from Mack's \narmy informed him of a victory and stated stra- \ntegically the position of the army was very fa- \nvorable. \n\n"Give me that letter," said Kutuzov turning \nto Prince Andrew. "Please have a look at it" \nand Kutuzov with an ironical smile about the \ncorners of his mouth read to the Austrian gen- \neral the following passage, in German, from \nthe Archduke Ferdinand's letter: \n\n\n\nWe have fully concentrated forces of nearly \nseventy thousand men with whitfi to attack and \ndefeat the enemy should he cross the Lech. Also, \nas we are masters of Ulm, we cannot be deprived \nof the advantage of commanding both sides of \nthe Danube, so that should the enemy not cross \nthe Lech, we can cross the Danube, throw ourselves \non his line of communications, recross the river \nlower down, and frustrate his intention should he \ntry to direct his whole force against our faithful \nally. We shall therefore confidently await the \nmoment when the Imperial Russian army will be \nfully equipped, and shall then, in conjunction \nwith it, easily find a way to prepare for the enemy \nthe fate he deserves. \n\nKutuzov sighed deeply on finishing this para- \ngraph and looked at the member of the Hof- \nkriegsrath mildly and attentively. \n\n"But you know the wise maxim, your excel- \nlency, advising one to expect the worst," said \nthe Austrian general, evidently wishing to have \ndone with jests and to come to business. He in- \nvoluntarily looked round at the aide-de-camp. \n\n"Excuse me, General," interrupted Kutuzov, \nalso turning to Prince Andrew. "Look here, my \ndear fellow, get from Kozl6vski all the reports \nfrom our scouts. Here are two letters from \nCount Nostitz and here is one from His High- \nness the Archduke Ferdinand and here are \nthese," he said, handing him several papers, \n"make a neat memorandum in French out of \nall this, showing all the news we have had of \nthe movements of the Austrian army, and then \ngive it to his excellency." \n\nPrince Andrew bowed his head in token of \nhaving understood from the first not only what \nhad been said but also what Kutuzov would \nhave liked to tell him. He gathered up the pa- \npers and, with a bow to both, stepped softly over \nthe carpet and went out into the waiting room. \n\nThough not much time had passed since \nPrince Andrew had left Russia, he had changed \ngreatly during that period. In the expression \nof his face, in his movements, in his walk, scarce- \nly a trace was left of his former affected languor \nand indolence. He now looked like a man who \nhas no time to think of the impression he makes \non others, but is occupied with agreeable and \ninteresting work. His face expressed more sat- \nisfaction with himself and those around him, \nhis smile and glance were brighter and more at- \ntractive. * &gt; \n\nKutuzov, whom he had overtaken in Poland, \nhad received him very kindly/ promised not to \nforget Win* distinguished him |bove the other \nadjutants, and had taken him to Vienna and \ngiven him- the more serious commissions. From \n\n\n\nBOOK \n\nVienna Kuttizov wrote to his old comrade, \nPrince Andrew's father. \n\nYour son bids fair to become an officer distin- \nguished by his industry, firmness, and expedition. \nI consider myself fortunate to have such a sub- \nordinate by me. \n\nOn Kutiizov's staff, among his fellow officers \nand in the army generally, Prince Andrew had, \nas he had had in Petersburg society, two quite \nopposite reputations. Some, a minority, ac- \nknowledged him to be different from them- \nselves and from everyone else, expected great \nthings of him, listened to him, admired, and \nimitated him, and with them Prince Andrew \nwas natural and pleasant. Others, the majority, \ndisliked him and considered him conceited, \ncold, and disagreeable. But among these people \nPrince Andrew knew how to take his stand so \nthat they respected and even feared him. \n\nComing out of Kutiizov's room into the wait- \ning room with the papers in his hand Prince \nAndrew came\ip to his comrade, the aide-de- \ncamp on duty, Kozl6vski, who was sitting at the \nwindow with a book. \n\n"Well, Prince?" asked Kozl6vski. \n\n"I am ordered to write a memorandum ex- \nplaining why we are not advancing." \n\n"And why is it?" \n\nPrince Andrew shrugged his shoulders. \n\n"Any news from Mack?" \n\n"No." \n\n"If it were true that he has been beaten, news \nwould have come." \n\n"Probably," said Prince Andrew moving to- \nward the outer door. \n\nBut at that instant a tall Austrian general in \na greatcoat, with the order of Maria Theresa \non his neck and a black bandage round his head, \nwho had evidently just arrived, entered quick- \nly, slamming the door. Prince Andrew stopped \nshort. \n\n"Commander in Chief Kutuzov?" said the \nnewly arrived general speaking quickly with a \nharsh German accent, looking to both sides \nand advancing straight toward the inner door. \n\n"The commander in chief is engaged," said \nKozl6vski, going hurriedly up to the unknown \ngeneral and blocking his way to the door. \n"Whom shall I announce?" \n\nThe unknown general looked disdainfully \ndown at Kozl6vski, who was rather short, as if \nsurprised that anyone should not know him. \n\n"The commander in chief is engaged," re- \npeated Kozl6vski calmly. \n\nThe general's face clouded, his lips quivered \n\n\n\nTWO 67 \n\nand trembled. He took out a notebook, hur- \nriedly scribbled something in pencil, tore out \nthe leaf, gave it to Kozl6vski, stepped quickly \nto the window, and threw himself into a chair, \ngazing at those in the room as if asking, "Why \ndo they look at me?" Then he lifted his head, \nstretched his neck as if he intended to say some- \nthing, but immediately, with affected indiffer- \nence, began to hum to himself, producing a \nqueer sound which immediately broke off. The \ndoor of the private room opened and Kutu- \nzov appeared in the doorway. The general with \nthe bandaged head bent forward as though run- \nning away from some danger, and, making \nlong, quick strides with his thin legs, went up \nto Kutiizov. \n\n"Vous voyez le malheureux Mack" he ut- \ntered in a broken voice. \n\nKutiizov's face as he stood in the open door- \nway remained perfectly immobile for a few mo- \nments. Then wrinkles ran over his face like a \nwave and his forehead became smooth again, \nhe bowed his head respectfully, closed his eyes, \nsilently let Mack enter his room before him, \nand closed the door himself behind him. \n\nThe report which had been circulated that \nthe Austrians had been beaten and that the \nwhole army had surrendered at Ulm proved to \nbe correct. Within half an hour adjutants had \nbeen sent in various directions with orders \nwhich showed that the Russian troops, who had \nhitherto been inactive, would also soon have to \nmeet the enemy. \n\nPrince Andrew was one of those rare staff \nofficers whose chief interest lay in the general \nprogress of the war. When he saw Mack and \nheard the details of his disaster he understood \nthat half the campaign was lost, understood all \nthe difficulties of the Russian army's position, \nand vividly imagined what awaited it and the \npart he would have to play. Involuntarily he \nfelt a joyful agitation at the thought of the hu- \nmiliation of arrogant Austria and that in a \nweek's time he might, perhaps, see and take \npart in the first Russian encounter with the \nFrench since Suv6rovmet them. He feared that \nBonaparte's genius might outweigh all the cour- \nage of the Russian troops, and at the same time \ncould not admit the idea of his hero being dis- \ngraced. \n\nExcited and irritated by these thoughts \nPrince Andrew went toward his room to write \nto his father, to whom he wrote every day. In \nthe corridor he met Nesvftski, with whom he \nshared a room, and the wag Zherk6v; they were \nas usual laughing. \n\n\n\n68 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\n"Why are you so glum?" asked Nesvitski no- \nticing Prince Andrew's pale face and glittering \neyes. \n\n"There's nothing to be gay about/' answered \nBolk6nski. \n\nJust as Prince Andrew met Nesvftski and \nZherk6v, there came toward them from the oth- \ner end of the corridor, Strauch, an Austrian \ngeneral who was on Kutiizov's staff in charge of \nthe provisioning of the Russian army, and the \nmember of the Hofkriegsrath who had arrived \nthe previous evening. There was room enough \nin the wide corridor for the generals to pass the \nthree officers quite easily, but Zherk6v, push- \ning Nesvitski aside with his arm, said in a \nbreathless voice, \n\n"They're coming! . . . they're coming! . . . \nStand aside, make way, please make way!" \n\nThe generals were passing by, looking as if \nthey wished to avoid embarrassing attentions. \nOn the face of the wag Zherk6v there sudden- \nly appeared a stupid smile of glee which he \nseemed unable to suppress. \n\n"Your excellency," said he in German, step- \nping forward and addressing the Austrian \ngeneral, "I have the honor to congratulate \nyou." \n\nHe bowed his head and scraped first with one \nfoot and then with the other, awkwardly, like \na child at a dancing lesson. \n\nThe member of the Hofkriegsrath looked at \nhim severely but, seeing the seriousness of his \nstupid smile, could not but give him a moment's \nattention. He screwed up his eyes showing that \nhe was listening. \n\n"I have the honor to congratulate you. Gen- \neral Mack has arrived, quite well, only a little \nbruised just here," he added, pointing with a \nbeaming smile to his head. \n\nThe general frowned, turned away, and went \non. \n\n"Gott, wie naiv!" * said he angrily, after he \nhad gone a few steps. \n\nNesvftski with a laugh threw his arms round \nPrince Andrew, but Bolk6nski, turning still \npaler, pushed him away with an angry look \nand turned to Zherkov. The nervous irritation \naroused by the appearance of Mack, the news \nof his defeat, and the thought of what lay be- \nfore the Russian army found vent in anger at \nZherk6v's untimely jest. \n\n"If you, sir, choose to make a buffoon of your- \nself," he said sharply, with a slight trembling \nof the lower jaw, "I can't prevent your doing \nso; but I warn you that if you dare to play the \n\n1 "Good God, what simplicity!" \n\n\n\nfool in my presence, I will teach you to behave \nyourself." \n\nNesvitski and Zherk6v were so surprised by \nthis outburst that they gazed at Bolk6nski si- \nlently with wide-open eyes. \n\n"What's the matter? I only congratulated \nthem," said Zherkov. \n\n"I am not jestingwith you; please be silent!" \ncried Bolk6nski, and taking Nesvf tski's arm he \nleft Zherkov, who did not know what to say. \n\n"Come, what's the matter, old fellow?" said \nNesvftski trying to soothe him. \n\n"What's the matter?" exclaimed Prince An- \ndrew standing still in his excitement. "Don't \nyou understand that either we are officers serv- \ning our Tsar and our country, rejoicing in the \nsuccesses and grieving at the misfortunes of our \ncommon cause, or we are merely lackeys who \ncare nothing for their master's business. Qua- \nrante mille homines massacres et Varme de \nnos allies detruite, et vous trouvez la le mot \npour rire," 2 he said, as if strengthening his \nviews by this French sentence. "C 9 est bien pour \nun garfonderiencornmecet individudontvous \navez fait un ami, mais pas pour vous, pas pour \nvous* Only a hobbledehoy could amuse him- \nself in this way," he added in Russian but pro- \nnouncing the word with a French accent hav- \ning noticed that Zherkov could still hear him. \n\nHe waited a moment to see whether the cor- \nnet would answer, but he turned and went out \nof the corridor. \n\nCHAPTER IV \n\nTHE PAVLOGRAD HUSSARS were stationed two \nmiles from Braunau. The squadron in which \nNicholas Rostov served as a cadet was quartered \nin the German village of Salzeneck. The best \nquarters in the village were assigned to cavalry- \ncaptain Denfsov, the squadron commander, \nknown throughout the whole cavalry division \nas Vdska Denfsov. Cadet Rost6v, ever since he \nhad overtaken the regiment in Poland, had \nlived with the squadron commander. \n\nOn October 1 1 , the day when all was astir at \nheadquarters over the news of Mack's defeat, \nthe camp life of the officers of this squadron \nwas proceeding as usual. Denfsov, who had \nbeen losing at cards all night, had not yet come \nhome when Rost6vrode back early in the morn- \ning from a foraging expedition. Rost6v in his \n\na "Forty thousand men massacred and the army \nof our allies destroyed, and you find that a cause \nfor jesting!" \n\n8 "It is all very well for that good-for-nothing \nfellow of whom you have made a friend, but not \nfor you, not for you." \n\n\n\nBOOK TWO \n\n\n\ncadet uniform, with a jerk to his horse, ro4e up \nto the porch, swung his leg over the saddle with \na supple youthful movement, stood for a mo- \nment in the stirrup as if loathe to part from his \nhorse, and at last sprang down and called to his \norderly. \n\n"Ah, Bondare*nko, dear friendl" said he to \nthe hussar who rushed up headlong to the \nhorse. "Walk him up and down, my dear fel- \nlow," he continued, with that gay brotherly cor- \ndiality which goodhearted young people show \nto everyone when they are happy. \n\n"Yes, your excellency," answered the Ukrain- \nian gaily, tossing his head. \n\n"Mind, walk him up and down well!" \n\nAnother hussar also rushed toward the horse, \nbut Bondar^nko had already thrown the reins \nof the snaffle bridle over the horse's head. It \nwas evident that the cadet was liberal with his \ntips and that it paid to serve him. Rost6v pat- \nted the horse's neck and then his flank, and \nlingered for a moment. \n\n"Splendid I What a horse he will be I" he \nthought with a smile, and holding up his saber, \nhis spurs jingling, he ran up the steps of the \nporch. His landlord, who in a waistcoat and \na pointed cap, pitchfork in hand, was clearing \nmanure from the cowhouse, looked out, and \nhis face immediately brightened on seeing Ros- \nt6v. "Schon gut Morgen! Schon gut Morgen!" 1 \nhe said winking with a merry smile, evidently \npleased to greet the young man. \n\n"Schon fleissig?"* said Rost6v with the same \ngay brotherly smile which did not leave his ea- \nger face. "Hoch Oestreicher! Hoch Russen! \nKaiser Alexander hoch!"* said he, quoting \nwords often repeated by the German landlord. \n\nThe German laughed, came out of the cow- \nshed, pulled off his cap, and waving it above \nhis head cried: \n\n"Und die game Welt hoch!" 4 \n\nRost6v waved his cap above his head like the \nGerman and cried laughing, "Und vivat die \ngame Welt!'" Though neither the German \ncleaning his cowshed nor Rost6v back with his \nplatoon from foraging for hay had any reason \nfor rejoicing, they looked at each other with \njoyful delight and brotherly love, wagged \ntheir heads in token of their mutual affec- \ntion, and parted smiling, the German return- \ning to his cowshed and Rost6v going to the \n\n1 "A very good morning! A very good morning!" \n"Busy already?" \n\n"Hurrah for the Austrians! Hurrah for the \nRussians! Hurrah for the Emperor Alexander!" \n* "And hurrah for the whole world!" \n\n\n\ncottage he occupied with Denfsov. \n\n"What about your master?" he asked Lavru- \nshka, Denfsov's orderly, whom all the regiment \nknew for a rogue. \n\n"Hasn't been in since the evening. Must have \nbeen losing," answered Lavrushka. "I know by \nnow, if he wins he comes back early to brag \nabout it, but if he stays out till morning it \nmeans he's lost and will come back in a rage. \nWill you have coffee?" \n\n"Yes, bring some." \n\nTen minutes later Lavrushka brought the \ncoffee. "He's coming!" said he. "Now for trou- \nble!" Rost6v looked out of the window and \nsaw Denfsov coming home. Denfsov was a small \nman with a red face, sparkling black eyes, and \nblack tousled mustache and hair. He wore an \nunfastened cloak, wide breeches hanging down \nin creases, and a crumpled shako on the back of \nhis head. He came up to the porch gloomily, \nhanging his head. \n\n"Lavwuskal" he shouted loudly and angrily, \n"take it off, blockhead!" \n\n"Well, I am taking it off," replied Lavrushka's \nvoice. \n\n"Ah, you're up already," said Denfsov, enter- \ning the room. \n\n"Long ago," answered Rost6v, "I have al- \nready been for the hay, and have seen Fraulein \nMathilde." \n\n"Weally! And I've been losing, bwother. I \nlost yesterday like a damned fool!" cried Den- \nfsov, not pronouncing his r's. "Such ill luck! \nSuch ill luck. As soon as you left, it began and \nwent on. Hullo there! Tea!" \n\nPuckering up his face as though smiling, and \nshowing his short strong teeth, he began with \nstubby fingers of both hands to ruffle up his \nthick tangled black hair. \n\n"And what devil made me go to that wat?" \n(an officer nicknamed "the rat") he said, rub- \nbing his forehead and whole face with both \nhands. "Just fancy, he didn't let me win a sin- \ngle cahd, not one cahd." \n\nHe took the lighted pipe that was offered to \nhim, gripped it in his fist, and tapped it on the \nfloor, making the sparks fly, while he continued \nto shout. \n\n"He lets one win the singles and collahs it as \nsoon as one doubles it; gives the singles and \nsnatches the doubles!" \n\nHe scattered the burning tobacco, smashed \nthe pipe, and threw it away. Then he remained \nsilent for a while, and all at once looked cheer- \nfully with his glittering, black eyes at Rost6v. \n\n"If at least we had some women here; but \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nthere's nothing foh one to do but dwink. If we \ncould only get to fighting soon. Hullo, who's \nthere?" he said, turning to the door as he heard \na tread of heavy boots and the clinking of spurs \nthat came to a stop, and a respectful cough. \n\n"The squadron quartermaster 1" said La- \nvriishka. \n\nDenlsov's face puckered still more. \n\n"Wetched!" he muttered, throwing down a \npurse with some gold in it. "Wostov, deah fel- \nlow, just see how much there is left and shove \nthe purse undah the pillow," he said, and went \nout to the quartermaster. \n\nRost6v took the money and, mechanically ar- \nranging the old and new coins in separate piles, \nbegan counting them. \n\n"Ah! Telydnin! How d'ye do? They plucked \nme last night," came Denisov's voice from the \nnext room. \n\n"Where? At Bykov's, at the rat's ... I knew \nit," replied a piping voice, and Lieutenant Tel- \nydnin, a small officer of the same squadron, en- \ntered the room. \n\nRost6v thrust the purse under the pillow and \nshook the damp little hand which was offered \nhim. Telydnin for some reason had been trans- \nferred from the Guards just before this cam- \npaign. He behaved very well in the regiment \nbut was not liked; Rost6v especially detested \nhim and was unable to overcome or conceal his \ngroundless antipathy to the man. \n\n"Well, young cavalryman, how is my Rook \nbehaving?" he asked. (Rook was a young horse \nTelydnin had sold to Rost6v.) \n\nThe lieutenant never looked the man he was \nspeaking to straight in the face; his eyes con- \ntinually wandered from one object to another. \n\n"I saw you riding this morn ing . . ." he added. \n\n"Oh, he's all right, a good horse," answered \nRost6v, though the horse for which he had paid \nseven hundred rubbles was not worth half that \nsum. "He's begun to go a little lame on the left \nforeleg," he added. \n\n"The hoof's cracked! That's nothing. I'll \nteach you what to do and show you what kind \nof rivet to use." \n\n"Yes, please do," said Rost6v. \n\n"I'll show you, I'll show you! It's not a secret. \nAnd it's a horse you'll thank me for." \n\n"Then I'll have it brought round," said Ros- \nt6v wishing to avoid Telydnin, and he went \nout to give the order. \n\nIn the passage Denisov, with a pipe, was \nsquatting on the threshold facing the quarter- \nmaster who was reporting to him. On seeing \nRost6v, Denfsov screwed up his face and point- \n\n\n\ning of er his shoulder with his thumb to the \nroom where Telydnin was sitting, he frowned \nand gave a shudder of disgust. \n\n"Ugh! I don't like that fellow," he said, re- \ngardless of the quartermaster's presence. \n\nRost6v shrugged his shoulders as much as to \nsay: "Nor do 1, but what's one to do?" and, \nhaving given his order, he returned to Telyd- \nnin. \n\nTelydnin was sitting in the same indolent \npose in which Rostov had left him, rubbing \nhis small white hands. \n\n"Well there certainly are disgusting people," \nthought Rost6v as he entered. \n\n"Have you told them to bring the horse?" \nasked Telydnin, getting up and looking care- \nlessly about him. \n\n"I have." \n\n"Let us go ourselves. I only came round to \nask Denisov about yesterday's order. Have you \ngot it, Denisov?" \n\n"Not yet. But where are you off to?" \n\n"I want to teach this young man how to shoe \na horse," said Telydnin. \n\nThey went through the porch and into the \nstable. The lieutenant explained how to rivet \nthe hoof and went away to his own quarters. \n\nWhen Rostov went back there was a bottle \nof vodka and a sausage on the table. Denfsov \nwas sitting there scratching with his pen on a \nsheet of paper. He looked gloomily in Rost6v's \nface and said: "I am witing to her." \n\nHe leaned his elbows on the table with his \npen in his hand and, evidently glad of a chance \nto say quicker in words what he wanted to \nwrite, told Rost6v the contents of his letter. \n\n"You see, my fwiend," he said, "we sleep \nwhen we don't love. We are childwen of the \ndust . . . but one falls in love and one is a God, \none is pua' as on the fihst day of cweation . . . \nWho's that now? Send him to the devil, I'm \nbusy!" he shouted to Lavrushka, who went up \nto him not in the least abashed. \n\n"Who should it be? You yourself told him to \ncome. It's the quartermaster for the money." \n\nDenisov frowned and was about to shout \nsome reply but stopped. \n\n"Wetched business," he muttered to himself. \n"How much is left in the puhse?" he asked, \nturning to Rost6v. \n\n"Seven new and three old imperials." \n\n"Oh, it's wetched! Well, what are you stand- \ning there for, you sca'cwow? Call the quahteh- \nmasteh," he shouted to Lavrushka. \n\n"Please, Denisov, let me lend you some: I \nhave some, you know," said Rost6v, blushing. \n\n\n\nBOOK TWO \n\n\n\n"Don't like bowwowing from my own fel- \nlows, I don't/' growled Denisov. \n\n"But if you won't accept money from me like \na comrade, you will offend me. Really I have \nsome," Rost6v repeated. \n\n"No, I tell you." \n\nAnd Denisov went to the bed to get the purse \nfrom under the pillow. \n\n"Where have you put it, Wost6v?" \n\n"Under the lower pillow." \n\n"It's not there." \n\nDenfsov threw both pillows on the floor. The \npurse was not there. \n\n"That's a miwacle." \n\n"Wait, haven't you dropped it?" said Ros- \ntov, picking up the pillows one at a time and \nshaking them. \n\nHe pulled off the quilt and shook it. The \npurse was not there. \n\n"Dear me, can I have forgotten? No, I re- \nmember thinking that you kept it under your \nhead like a treasure," said Rost6v. "I put it just \nhere. Where is it?" he asked, turning to Lavni- \nshka. \n\n"I haven't been in the room. It must be \nwhere you put it." \n\n"But it isn't? . . ." \n\n"You're always like that; you thwow a thing \ndown anywhere and forget it. Feel in your \npockets." \n\n"No, if I hadn't thought of it being a treas- \nure," said Rostov, "but I remember putting it \nthere." \n\nLavrtishka turned all the bftkling over, \nlooked under the bed and under the table, \nsearched everywhere, and stood still in the mid- \ndle of the room. Denisov silently watched La- \nvrushka's movements, and when the latter \nthrew up his arms in surprise saying it was no- \nwhere to be found Denisov glanced at Rost6v. \n\n"Wost6v, you've not been playing schoolboy \ntwicks. . . ." \n\nRost6v felt Denf sov's gaze fixed on him, raised \nhis eyes, and instantly dropped them again. All \nthe blood which had seemed congested some- \nwhere below his throat rushed to his face and \neyes. He could not draw breath. \n\n"And there hasn't been anyone in the room \nexcept the lieutenant and yourselves. It must \nbe here somewhere," said Lavrtishka. \n\n"Now then, you devil's puppet, look alive \nand hunt for it!" shouted Denfsov, suddenly, \nturning purple and rushing at the man with a \nthreatening gesture. "If the purse isn't found \nI'll flog you, I'll flog you all." \n\nRost6v, his eyes avoiding Denisov, began \n\n\n\nbuttoning his coat, buckled on his saber, and \nput on his cap. \n\n"I must have that purse, I tell you," shouted \nDenfsov, shaking his orderly by the shoulders \nand knocking him against the wall. \n\n"Denfsov, let him alone, I know who has \ntaken it," said Rost6v, going toward the door \nwithout raising his eyes. Denisov paused, \nthought a moment, and, evidently understand- \ning what Rost6v hinted at, seized his arm. \n\n"Nonsense!" he cried, and the veins on his \nforehead and neck stood out like cords. "You \nare mad, I tell you. I won't allow it. The purse \nis here! I'll flay this scoundwel alive, and it \nwill be found." \n\n"I know who has taken it," repeated Rost6v \nin an unsteady voice, and went to the door. \n\n"And I tell you, don't you dahe to do it!" \nshouted Denfsov, rushing at the cadet to re- \nstrain him. \n\nBut Rost6v pulled away his arm and, with as \nmuch anger as though Denfsov were his worst \nenemy, firmly fixed his eyes directly on his face. \n\n"Do you understand what you're saying?" he \nsaid in a trembling voice. "There was no one \nelse in the room except myself. So that if it is \nnot so, then . . ." \n\nHe could not finish, and ran out of the room. \n\n"Ah, may the devil take you and evewybody," \nwere the last words Rost6v heard. \n\nRostov went to Telynin's quarters. \n\n"The master is not in, he's gone to head- \nquarters," said Telydnin's orderly. "Has some- \nthing happened?" he added, surprised at the \ncadet's troubled face. \n\n"No, nothing." \n\n"You've only just missed him," said the or- \nderly. \n\nThe headquarters were situated two miles \naway from Salzeneck, and Rost6v, without re- \nturning home, took a horse and rode there. \nThere was an inn in the village which the of- \nficers frequented. Rost6v rode up to it and saw \nTelyan in's horse at the porch. \n\nIn the second room of the inn the lieuten- \nant was sitting over a dish of sausages and a \nbottle of wine. \n\n"Ah, you've come here too, young man!" he \nsaid, smiling and raising his eyebrows. \n\n"Yes," said Rost6v as if it cost him a great \ndeal to utter the word; and he sat down at the \nnearest table. \n\nBoth were silent. There were two Germans \nand a Russian officer in the room. No one spoke \nand the only sounds heard were the clatter of \nknives and the munching of the lieutenant. \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nWhen Telydnin had finished his lunch he \ntook out of his pocket a double purse and, \ndrawing its rings aside with his small, white, \nturned-up fingers, drew out a gold imperial, \nand lifting his eyebrows gave it to the waiter. \n\n"Please be quick/' he said. \n\nThe coin was a new one. Rost6v rose and \nwent up to Telydnin. \n\n"Allow me to look at your purse," he said in \na low, almost inaudible, voice. \n\nWith shifting eyes but eyebrows still raised, \nTelydnin handed him the purse. \n\n"Yes, it's a nice purse. Yes, yes," he said, grow- \ning suddenly pale, and added, "Look at it, \nyoung man." \n\nRost6v took the purse in his hand, examined \nit and the money in it, and looked at Telydnin. \nThe lieutenant was looking about in his usual \nway and suddenly seemed to grow very merry. \n\n"If we get to Vienna I'll get rid of it there \nbut in these wretched little towns there's no- \nwhere to spend it," said he. "Well, let me have \nit, young man, I'm going." \n\nRost6v did not speak. \n\n"And you? Are you going to have lunch too? \nThey feed you quite decently here," continued \nTelydnin. "Now then, let me have it." \n\nHe stretched out his hand to take hold of the \npurse. Rost6v let go of it. Telyinin took the \npurse and began carelessly slipping it into the \npocket of his riding breeches, with his eyebrows \nlifted and his mouth slightly open, as if to say, \n"Yes, yes, I am putting my purse in my pocket \nand that's quite simple and is no one else's busi- \nness." \n\n"Well, young man?" he said with a sigh, and \nfrom under his lifted brows he glanced into \nRost6v's eyes. \n\nSome flash as of an electric spark shot from \nTelydnin's eyes to Rost6v's and back, and back \nagain and again in an instant. \n\n"Come here," said Rostdv, catching hold of \nTelydnin's arm and almost dragging him to \nthe window. "That money is Denisov's; you \ntook it . . ." he whispered just above Telydnin's \near. \n\n"What? What? How dare you? What?" said \nTelyinin. \n\nBut these words came like a piteous, despair- \ning cry and an entreaty for pardon. As soon as \nRost6v heard them, an enormous load of doubt \nfell from him. He was glad, and at the same in- \nstant began to pity the miserable man who \nstood before him, but the task he had begun \nhad to be completed. \n\n"Heaven only knows what the people here \n\n\n\nmay Imagine," muttered Telydnin, taking up \nhis cap and moving toward a small empty room. \n"We must have an explanation . . ." \n\n"I know it and shall prove it," said Rost6v. \n\n"I . . ." \n\nEvery muscle of Telydnin's pale, terrified \nface began to quiver, his eyes still shifted from \nside to side but with a downward look not ris- \ning to Rost6v's face, and his sobs were audible. \n\n"Countl . . . Don't ruin a young fellow . . . \nhere is this wretched money, take it . . ." He \nthrew it on the table. "I have an old father \nand mother! . . ." \n\nRostcW took the money, avoiding Telynin's \neyes, and went o'ut of the room without a word. \nBut at the door he stopped and then retraced \nhis steps. "O God," he said with tears in his \neyes, "how could you do it?" \n\n"Count . . ." said Telydnin drawing nearer \nto him. \n\n"Don't touch me," said Rost6v,drawingback. \n"If you need it, take the money," and he threw \nthe purse to him and ran out of the inn. \n\nCHAPTER V \n\nTHAT SAME EVENING there was an animated dis- \ncussion among the squadron's officers in Denf- \nsov's quarters. \n\n"And I tell you, Rost6v, that you must apol- \nogize to the colonel!" said a tall, grizzly-haired \nstaff captain, with enormous mustaches and \nmany wrinkles on his large features, to Rost6v \nwho was crimson with excitement. \n\nThe staff captain, Kfrsten, had twice been \nreduced to the ranks for affairs of honor and \nhad twice regained his commission. \n\n"I will allow no one to call me a liar!" cried \nRost6v. "He told me I lied, and I told him he \nlied. And there it rests. He may keep me on \nduty every day, or may place me under arrest, \nbut no one can make me apologize, because if \nhe, as commander of this regiment, thinks it \nbeneath his dignity to give me satisfaction, \nthen . . ." \n\n"You just wait a moment, my dear fellow, \nand listen," interrupted the staff captain in his \ndeep bass, calmly stroking his long mustache. \n"You tell the colonel in the presence of other \nofficers that an officer has stolen . . ." \n\n"I'm not to blame that the conversation be- \ngan in the presence of other officers. Perhaps I \nought not to have spoken before them, but I \nam not a diplomatist. That's why I joined the \nhussars, thinking that here one would not need \nfinesse; and he tells me that I am lying so let \nhim give me satisfaction . . ." \n\n\n\nBOOK TWO \n\n\n\n"That's all right. No one thinks you a coward, \nbut that's not the point. Ask Denfsov whether \nit is not out of the question for a cadet to de- \nmand satisfaction of his regimental command- \ner?" \n\nDenisov sat gloomily biting his mustache \nand listening to the conversation, evidently \nwith no wish to take part in it. He answered \nthe staff captain's question by a disapproving \nshake of his head. \n\n"You speak to the colonel about this nasty \nbusiness before other officers," continued the \nstaff captain, "and Bogddnich" (the colonel \nwas called Bogdanich) "shuts you up." \n\n"He did not shut me up, he said I was tell- \ning an untruth." \n\n"Well, have it so, and you talked a lot of \nnonsense to him and must apologize." \n\n"Not on any account!" exclaimed Rost6v. \n\n"I did not expect this of you," said the staff \ncaptain seriously and severely. "You don't wish \nto apologize, but, man, it's not only to him but \nto the whole regiment all of us you're to \nblame all round. The case is this: you ought to \nhave thought the matter over and taken advice; \nbut no, you go and blurt it all straight out be- \nfore the officers. Now what was the colonel to \ndo? Have the officer tried and disgrace the \nwhole regiment? Disgrace the whole regiment \nbecause of one scoundrel? Is that how you look \nat it? We don't see it like that. And Bogdanich \nwas a brick: he told you you were saying what \nwas not true. It's not pleasant, but what's to be \ndone, my dear fellow? You landed yourself in \nit. And now, when one wants to smooth the \nthing over, some conceit prevents your apolo- \ngizing, and you wish to make the whole affair \npublic. You are offended at being put on duty \na bit, but why not apologize to an old and hon- \norable officer? Whatever Bogdanich may be, \nanyway he is an honorable and brave old colo- \nnel! You're quick at taking offense, but you \ndon't mind disgracing the whole regiment 1" \nThe staff captain's voice began to tremble. \n"You have been in the regiment next to no \ntime, my lad, you're here today and tomorrow \nyou'll be appointed adjutant somewhere and \ncan snap your fingers when it is said There are \nthieves among the Pdvlograd officers!' But it's \nnot all the same to us! Am I not right, Denisov? \nIt's not the same!" \n\nDenfsov remained silent and did not move, \nbut occasionally looked with his glittering black \neyes at Rost6v. \n\n"You value your own pride and don't wish \nto apologize," continued the staff captain, "but \n\n\n\n73 \n\n\n\nwe old fellows, who have grown up in and, \nGod willing, are going to die in the regiment, \nwe prize the honor of the regiment, and Bog- \ndnich knows it. Oh, we do prize it, old fel- \nlow! And all this is not right, it's not right! You \nmay take offense or not but I always stick to \nmother truth. It's not right!" \n\nAnd the staff captain rose and turned away \nfrom Rost6v. \n\n"That's twue, devil take i 1 1 " shouted Denfsov, \njumping up. "Now then, Wost6v, now then!" \n\nRost6v, growing red and pale alternately, \nlooked first at one officer and then at the other. \n\n"No, gentlemen, no ... you mustn't think \n... I quite understand. You're wrong to think \nthat of me ... I ... for me ... for the honor of \nthe regiment I'd ... Ah well, I'll show that in \naction, and for me the honor of the flag . . .Well, \nnever mind, it's true I'm to blame, to blame all \nround. Well, what else do you want? . . ." \n\n"Come, that's right, Count!" cried the staff \ncaptain, turning round and clapping Rost6v \non the shoulder with his big hand. \n\n"I tell you," shouted Denisov, "he's a fine fel- \nlow." \n\n"That's better, Count," said thestaff captain, \nbeginning to address Rost6v by his title, as if \nin recognition of his confession. "Go and apol- \nogize, your excellency. Yes, go!" \n\n"Gentlemen, I'll do anything. No one shall \nhear a word from me," said Rost6v in an implor- \ning voice, "but I can't apologize, by God I can't, \ndo what you will! How can I go and apologize \nlike a little boy asking forgiveness?" \n\nDenfsov began to laugh. \n\n"It'll be worse for you. Bogddnich is vindic- \ntive and you'll pay for your obstinacy," said \nKfrsten. \n\n"No, on my word it's not obstinacy! I can't \ndescribe the feeling. I can't . . ." \n\n"Well, it's as you like," said the staff captain. \n"And what has become of that scoundrel?" he \nasked Denfsov. \n\n"He has weported himself sick, he's to be \nstwuck off the list tomowwow," muttered Den- \nfsov. \n\n"It is an illness, there's no other way of ex- \nplaining it," said the staff captain. \n\n"Illness or not, he'd better not cwossmy path. \nI'd kill him!" shouted Denfsov in a bloodthirsty \ntone. \n\nJust then Zherk6v entered the room. \n\n"What brings you here?" cried the officers \nturning to the newcomer. \n\n"We're to go into action, gentlemen! Mack \nhas surrendered with his whole army." \n\n\n\n74 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\n"It's not true!" \n\n"I've seen him myself!" \n\n"What? Saw the real Mack? With hands and \nfeet?" \n\n"Into action! Intoactioni Bring him a bottle \nfor such news! But how did you come here?" \n\n"I've been sent back to the regiment all on \naccount of that devil, Mack. An Austrian gen- \neral complained of me. I congratulated him on \nMack's arrival . . . What's the matter, Rost6v? \nYou look as if you'd just come out of a hot \nbath." \n\n"Oh, my dear fellow, we're in such a stew \nhere these last two days." \n\nThe regimental adjutant came in and con- \nfirmed the news brought by Zherk6v. They \nwere under orders to advance next day. \n\n"We're going into action, gentlemen!" \n\n"Well, thank God! We've been sitting here \ntoo long!" \n\nCHAPTER VI \n\nKunfzov FELL BACK toward Vienna, destroying \nbehind him the bridges over the rivers Inn (at \nBraunau) and Traun (near Linz). On October \n23 the Russian troops were crossing tfye river \nEnns. At midday the Russian baggage train, \nthe artillery, and columns of troops were de- \nfiling through the town of Enns on both sides \nof the bridge. \n\nIt was a warm, rainy, autumnal day. The wide \nexpanse that opened out before the heights on \nwhich the Russian batteries stood guarding \nthe bridge was at times veiled by a diaphanous \ncurtain of slanting rain, and then, suddenly \nspread out in the sunlight, far-distant objects \ncould be clearly seen glittering as though fresh- \nly varnished. Down below, the little town could \nbe seen with its white, red-roofed houses, its \ncathedral, and its bridge, on both sides of which \nstreamed jostling masses of Russian troops. At \nthe bend of the Danube, vessels, an island, and \na castle with a park surrounded by the waters \nof the confluence of the Enns and the Danube \nbecame visible, and the rocky left bank of the \nDanube covered with pine forests, with a mystic \nbackground of green treetops and bluish gor- \nges. The turrets of a convent stood out beyond \na wild virgin pine forest, and far away on the \nother side of the Enns the enemy's horse patrols \ncould be discerned. \n\nAmong the field guns on the brow of the hill \nthe general in command of the rearguard stood \nwith a staff officer, scanning the country through \nhis fieldglass. A little behind them Nesvftski, \nwho had been sent to the rearguard by the com- \n\n\n\nmaiVder in chief, was sitting on the trail of a \ngun carriage. A Cossack who accompanied him \nhad handed him a knapsack and a flask, and \nNesvf tski was treating some officers to pies and \nreal doppelkummel. The officers gladly gath- \nered round him, some on their knees, some \nsquatting Turkish fashion on the wet grass. \n\n"Yes, the Austrian prince who built that cas- \ntle was no fool. It's a fine place! Why are you \nnot eating any thing, gentlemen?" Nesvitski was \nsaying. \n\n"Thank you very much, Prince," answered \none of the officers, pleased to be talking to a \nstaff officer of such importance. "It's a lovely \nplace! We passed close to the park and saw \ntwo deer . . . and what a splendid house!" \n\n"Look, Prince," said another, who would \nhave dearly liked to take another pie but felt \nshy, and therefore pretended to be examining \nthe countryside "See, our infantrymen have \nalready got there. Look there in the meadow \nbehind the village, three of them are dragging \nsomething. They'll ransack that castle," he re- \nmarked with evident approval. \n\n"So they will," said Nesvitski. "No, but what \nI should like," added he, munching a pie in his \nmoist-lipped handsome mouth, "would be to \nslip in over there." \n\nHe pointed with a smile to a turreted nun- \nnery, and his eyes narrowed and gleamed. \n\n"That would be fine, gentlemen!" \n\nThe officers laughed. \n\n"Just to flutter the nuns a bit. They say there \nare Italian girls among them. On my word I'd \ngive five years of my life for it!" \n\n"They must be feeling dull, too," said one of \nthe bolder officers, laughing. \n\nMeanwhile the staff officer standing in front \npointed out something to the general, who \nlooked through his field glass. \n\n"Yes, so it is, so it is," said the general an- \ngrily, lowering the field glass and shrugging his \nshoulders, "so it is! They'll be fired on at the \ncrossing. And why are they dawdling there?" \n\nOn the opposite side the enemy could be \nseen by the naked eye, and from their battery a \nmilk-white cloud arose. Then came the distant \nreport of a shot, and our troops could be seen \nhurrying to the crossing. \n\nNesvftski rose, puffing, and went up to the \ngeneral, smiling. \n\n"Would not your excellency like a little re- \nfreshment?" he said. \n\n"It's a bad business," said the general with- \nout answering him, "our men have been wast- \ning time." \n\n\n\nBOOK TWO \n\n\n\n75 \n\n\n\n"Hadn't I better ride over, your excellency?" \nasked Nesvitski. \n\n"Yes, please do," answered the general, and \nhe repeated the order that had already once \nbeen given in detail: "and tell the hussars that \nthey are to cross last and to fire the bridge as I \nordered; and the inflammable material on the \nbridge must be reinspected." \n\n"Very good," answered Nesvftski. \n\nHe called the Cossack with his horse, told \nhim to put away the knapsack and flask, and \nswung his heavy person easily into the saddle. \n\n"I'll really call in on the nuns," he said to \nthe officers who watched him smilingly, and he \nrode off by the winding path down the hill. \n\n"Now then, let's see how far it will carry, \nCaptain. Just tryl" said the general, turning to \nan artillery officer. "Have a little fun to pass \nthe time." \n\n"Crew, to your gunsl" commanded the of- \nficer. \n\nIn a moment the men came running gaily \nfrom their campfires and began loading. \n\n"One!" came the command. \n\nNumber one jumped briskly aside. The gun \nrang out with a deafening metallic roar, and \na whistling grenade flew above the heads of \nour troops below the hill and fell far short of \nthe enemy, a little smoke showing the spot \nwhere it burst. \n\nThe faces of officers and men brightened up \nat the sound. Everyone gotupand began watch- \ning the movements of our troops below, as \nplainly visible as if but a stone's throw away, \nand the movements of the approaching enemy \nfarther off. At the same instant the sun came \nfully out from behind the clouds, and the clear \nsound of the solitary shot and the brilliance of \nthe bright sunshine merged in a single joyous \nand spirited impression. \n\nCHAPTER VII \n\nTwo OF the enemy's shots had already flown \nacross the bridge, where there was a crush. Half- \nway across stood Prince Nesvitski, who had \nalighted from his horse and whose big body was \njammed against the railings. He looked back \nlaughing to the Cossack who stood a few steps \nbehind him holding two horses by their bridles. \nEach time Prince Nesvftski tried to move on, \nsoldiers and carts pushed him back again and \npressed him against the railings, and all he \ncould do was to smile. \n\n"What a fellow you are, friend!" said the \nCossack to a convoy soldier with a wagon, who \nwas pressing onto the infantrymen who were \n\n\n\ncrowded together close to his wheels and his \nhorses. "What a fellow! You can't wait a mo- \nment! Don't you see the general wants to pass?" \n\nBut the convoyman took no notice of the \nword "general" and shouted at the soldiers \nwho were blocking his way. "Hi there, boys! \nKeep to the left! Wait a bit." But the soldiers, \ncrowded together shoulder to shoulder, their \nbayonets interlocking, moved over the bridge \nin a dense mass. Looking down over the rails \nPrince Nesvftski saw the rapid, noisy little \nwaves of the Enns, which rippling and eddying \nround the piles of the bridge chased each other \nalong. Looking on the bridge^ he saw equally \nuniform living waves of soldiers, shoulder \nstraps, covered shakos, knapsacks, bayonets, \nlong muskets, and, under the shakos, faces with \nbroad cheekbones, sunken cheeks, and listless \ntired expressions, and feet that moved through \nthe sticky mud that covered the planks of the \nbridge. Sometimes through the monotonous \nwaves of men, like a fleck of white foam on the \nwaves of the Enns, an officer, in a cloak and \nwith a type of face different from that of the \nmen, squeezed his way along; sometimes like \na chip of wood whirling in the river, an hussar \non foot, an orderly, or a townsman was carried \nthrough the waves of infantry; and sometimes \nlike a log floating down the river, an officers' or \ncompany's baggage wagon, piled high, leather- \ncovered, and hemmed in on all sides, moved \nacross the bridge. \n\n"It's as if a dam had burst," said the Cossack \nhopelessly. "Are there many more of you to \ncome?" \n\n"A million all but one!" replied a waggish \nsoldier in a torn coat, with a wink, and passed \non followed by another, an old man. \n\n"If he" (he meant the enemy) "begins pop- \nping at the bridge now," said the old soldier \ndismally to a comrade, "you'll forget to scratch \nyourself." \n\nThat soldier passed on, and after him came \nanother sitting on a cart. \n\n"Where the devil have the leg bands been \nshoved to?" said an orderly, running behind \nthe cart and fumbling in the back of it. \n\nAnd he also passed on with the wagon. Then \ncame some merry soldiers who had evidently \nbeen drinking. \n\n"And then, old fellow, he gives him one in \nthe teeth with the butt end of his gun ..." a \nsoldier whose greatcoat was well tucked up said \ngaily, with a wide swing of his arm. \n\n"Yes, the ham was just delicious . . ." an- \nswered another with a loud laugh. And they, \n\n\n\n7 6 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\ntoo, passed on, so that Nesvftski did not learn \nwho had been struck on the teeth, or what the \nham had to do with it. \n\n"Bah! How they scurry. He just sends a ball \nand they think they'll all be killed," a sergeant \nwas saying angrfly and reproachfully. \n\n"As it flies past me, Daddy, the ball I mean," \nsaid a young soldier with an enormous mouth, \nhardly refraining from laughing, "I felt like \ndying of fright. I did, 'pon my word, I got that \nfrightened I" said he, as if bragging of having \nbeen frightened. \n\nThat one also passed. Then followed a cart \nunlike any that had gone before. It was a Ger- \nman cart with a pair of horses led by a German, \nand seemed loaded with a whole houseful of \neffects. A fine brindled cow with a large udder \nwas attached to the cart behind. A woman with \nan unweaned baby, an old woman, and a \nhealthy German girl with bright red cheeks \nwere sitting on some feather beds. Evidently \nthese fugitives were allowed to pass by special \npermission. The eyes of all the soldiers turned \ntoward the women, and while the vehicle was \npassing at foot pace all the soldiers' remarks re- \nlated to the two young ones. Every face bore \nalmost the same smile, expressing unseemly \nthoughts about the women. \n\n"Just see, the German sausage is making \ntracks, tool" \n\n"Sell me the missis," said another soldier, ad- \ndressing the German, who, angry and fright- \nened, strode energetically along with downcast \neyes. \n\n"See how smart she's made herself! Oh, the \ndevilsl" \n\n"There, Fed6tov,-you should be quartered \non them!" \n\n"I have seen as much before now, mate!" \n\n"Where are you going?" asked an infantry \nofficer who was eating an apple, also half smil- \ning as he looked at the handsome girl. \n\nThe German closed his eyes, signifying that \nhe did not understand. \n\n"Take it if you like," said the officer, giving \nthe girl an apple. \n\nThe girl smiled and took it. Nesvftski like \nthe rest of the men on the bridge did not take \nhis eyes off the women till they had passed. \nWhen they had gone by, the same stream of \nsoldiers followed, with the same kind of talk, \nand at last all stopped. As often happens, the \nhorses of a convoy wagon became restive at the \nend of the bridge, and the whole crowd had to \nwait. \n\n"And why are they stopping? There's no \n\n\n\nproper order!" said the soldiers. "Where are \nyou shoving to? Devil take you! Can't you wait? \nIt'll be worse if he fires the bridge. See, here's \nan officer jammed in too" different voices \nwere saying in the crowd, as the men looked at \none another, and all pressed toward the exit \nfrom the bridge. \n\nLooking down at the waters of the Enns \nunder the bridge, Nesvftski suddenly heard a \nsound new to him, of something swiftly ap- \nproaching . . . something big, that splashed in- \nto the water. \n\n"Just see where it carries to!" a soldier near \nby said sternly, looking round at the sound. \n\n"Encouraging us to get along quicker," said \nanother uneasily. \n\nThe crowd moved on again. Nesvftski re- \nalized that it was a cannon ball. \n\n"Hey, Cossack, my horse!" he said. "Now, \nthen, you there! get out of theway! Makeway!" \n\nWith great difficulty he managed to get to \nhis horse, and shouting continually he moved \non. The soldiers squeezed themselves to make \nway for him, but again pressed on him so that \nthey jammed his leg, and those nearest him \nwere not to blame for they were themselves \npressed still harder from behind. \n\n"Nesvftski, Nesvftski! you numskull!" came \na hoarse voice from behind him. \n\nNesvftski looked round and saw, some fif- \nteen paces away but separated by the living \nmass of moving infantry, Vaska Denfsov, red \nand shaggy, with his cap on the back of his \nblack head and a cloak hanging jauntily over \nhis shoulder. \n\n"Tell these devils, these fiends, to let me \npass!" shouted Denfsov evidently in a fit of \nrage, his coal-black eyes with their bloodshot \nwhites glittering and rolling as he waved his \nsheathed saber in a small bare hand as red as \nhis face. \n\n"Ah, Vaska!" joyfully replied Nesvftski. \n"What's up with you?" \n\n"The squadwon can't pass," shouted Vska \nDenfsov, showing his white teeth fiercely and \nspurring his black thoroughbred Arab, which \ntwitched its ears as the bayonets touched it, \nand snorted, spurting white foam from his bit, \ntramping the planks of the bridge with his \nhoofs, and apparently ready to jump over the \nrailings had his rider let him. "What is this? \nThey're like sheep! Just like sheep! Out of the \nway! . . . Let us pass! . . . Stop there, you devil \nwith the cart! I'll hack you with my saber!" he \nshouted, actually drawing his saber from its \nscabbard and flourishing it. \n\n\n\nBOOK TWO \n\n\n\n77 \n\n\n\nThe soldiers crowded against one another \nwith terrified faces, and Denfsov joined Nesvit- \nski. \n\n"How's it you're not drunk today?" said Nes- \nvitski when the other had ridden up to him. \n\n"They don't even give one time to dwink!" \nanswered Vdska Denisov. "They keep dwag- \nging the wegiment to and fwo all day. If they \nmean to fight, let's fight. But the devil knows \nwhat this is." \n\n"What a dandy you are today!" said Nesvft- \nski, looking at Denfsov's new cloak and saddle- \ndoth. \n\nDenisov smiled, took out of his sabretache a \nhandkerchief that diffused a smell of perfume, \nand put it to Nesvftski's nose. \n\n"Of course. I'm going into action! I've \nshaved, bwushed my teeth, and scented my- \nself." \n\nThe imposing figure of Nesvitski followed \nby his Cossack, and the determination of Deni- \nsov who flourished his sword and shouted fran- \ntically, had such an effect that they managed to \nsqueeze through to the farther side of the \nbridge and stopped the infantry. Beside the \nbridge Nesvftski found the colonel to whom \nhe had to deliver the order, and having done \nthis he rode back. \n\nHaving cleared the way Denisov stopped at \nthe end of the bridge. Carelessly holding in his \nstallion that was neighing and pawing the \nground, eager to rejoin its fellows, he watched \nhis squadron draw nearer. Then the clang of \nhoofs, as of several horses galloping, resounded \non the planks of the bridge, and the squadron, \nofficers in front and men four abreast, spread \nacross the bridge and began to emerge on his \nside of it. \n\nThe infantry who had been stopped crowd- \ned near the bridge in the trampled mud and \ngazed with that particular feeling of ill-will, \nestrangement, and ridicule with which troops \nof different arms usually encounter one anoth- \ner at the clean, smart hussars who moved past \nthem in regular order. \n\n"Smart lads! Only fit for a fair!" said one. \n\n"What good are they? They're led about \njust for show!" remarked another. \n\n"Don't kick up the dust, you infantry 1" jested \nan hussar whose prancing horse had splashed \nmud over some foot soldiers. \n\n"I'd like to put you on a two days' march \nwith a knapsack! Your fine cords would soon \nget a bit rubbed," said an infantryman, wiping \nthe mud off his face with his sleeve. "Perched \nup there, you're more like a bird than a man." \n\n\n\n"There now, Zikin, they ought to put you \non a horse. You'd look fine," said a corporal, \nchaffing a thin little soldier who bent under \nthe weight of his knapsack. \n\n"Take a stick between your legs, that'll suit \nyou for a horse!" the hussar shouted back. \n\nCHAPTER VIII \n\nTHE LAST of the infantry hurriedly crossed the \nbridge, squeezing together as they approached \nit as if passing through a funnel. At last the \nbaggage wagons had all crossed, the crush was \nless, and the last battalion came on to the bridge. \nOnly Denisov's squadron of hussars remained \non the farther side of the bridge facing the en- \nemy, who could be seen from the hill on the \nopposite bank but was not yet visible from the \nbridge, for the horizon as seen from the valley \nthrough which the river flowed was formed by \nthe rising ground only half a mile away. At the \nfoot of the hill lay wasteland over which a few \ngroups of our Cossack scouts were moving. Sud- \ndenly on the road at the top of the high ground, \nartillery and troops in blue uniform were seen. \nThese were the French. A group of Cossack \nscouts retired down the hill at a trot. All the \nofficers and men of Denisov's squadron, though \nthey tried to talk of other things and to look in \nother directions, thought only of what was \nthere on the hilltop, and kept constantly look- \ning at the patches appearing on the skyline, \nwhich they knew to be the enemy's troops. The \nweather had cleared again since noon and the \nsun was descending brightly upon the Danube \nand the dark hills around it. It was calm, and \nat intervals the bugle calls and the shouts of \nthe enemy could be heard from the hill. There \nwas no one now between* the squadron and the \nenemy except a few scattered skirmishers. An \nempty space of some seven hundred yards was \nall that separated them. The enemy ceased fir- \ning, and that stern, threatening, inaccessible, \nand intangible line which separates two hostile \narmies was all the more clearly felt. \n\n"One step beyond that boundary line which \nresembles the line dividing the living from the \ndead lies uncertainty, suffering, and death. And \nwhat is there? Who is there? there beyond that \nfield, that tree, that roof lit up by the sun? No \none knows, but one wants to know. You fear \nand yet long to cross that line, and know that \nsooner or later it must be crossed and you will \nhave to find out what is there, just as you will \ninevitably have to learn what lies the other side \nof death. But you are strong, healthy, cheerful, \nand excited, and are surrounded by other such \n\n\n\n7 8 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nexcitedly animated and healthy men." So \nthinks, or at any rate feels, anyone who comes \nin sight of the enemy, and that feeling gives a \nparticular glamour and glad keenness of im- \npression to everything that takes place at such \nmoments. \n\nOn the high ground where the enemy was, \nthe smoke of a cannon rose, and a ball flew \nwhistling over the heads of the hussar squad- \nron. The officers who had been standing to- \ngether rode off to their places. The hussars be- \ngan carefully aligning their horses. Silence fell \non the whole squadron. All were looking at the \nenemy in front and at the squadron command- \ner, awaiting the word of command. A second \nand a third cannon ball flew past. Evidently \nthey were firing at the hussars, but the balls \nwith rapid rhythmic whistle flew over the heads \nof the horsemen and fell somewhere beyond \nthem. The hussars did not look round, but at \nthe sound of each shot, as at the word of com- \nmand, the whole squadron with its rows of \nfaces so alike yet so different, holding its breath \nwhile the ball flew past, rose in the stirrups and \nsank back again. The soldiers without turning \ntheir heads glanced at one another, curious to \nsee their comrades' impression. Every face, from \nDenisov's to that of the bugler, showed one \ncommon expression of conflict, irritation, and \nexcitement, around chin and mouth. The \nquartermaster frowned, looking at the soldiers \nas if threatening to punish them. Cadet Mir6- \nnov ducked every time a ball flew past. Rost6v \non the left flank, mounted on his Rook a hand- \nsome horse despite its game leg had the happy \nair of a schoolboy called up before a large audi- \nence for an examination in which he feels sure \nhe will distinguish himself. He was glancing at \neveryone with a clear, bright expression, as if \nasking them to notice how calmly he sat under \nfire. But despite himself, on his face too that \nsame indication of something new and stern \nshowed round the mouth. \n\n"Who's that curtseying there? Cadet Miw6- \nnov! That's not wight! Look at me," cried \nDenfsov who, unable to keep still on one \nspot, kept turning his horse in front of the \nsquadron. \n\nThe black, hairy, snub-nosed face of Vdska \nDenhov,and his whole short sturdy figure with \nthe sinewy hairy hand and stumpy fingers in \nwhich he held the hilt of his naked saber, \nlooked just as it usually did, especially toward \nevening when he had emptied his second bot- \ntle; he was only redder than usual. With his \nshaggy head thrown back like birds when they \n\n\n\ndrink, pressing his spurs mercilessly into the \nsides of his good horse, Bedouin, and sitting as \nthough falling backwards in the saddle, he gal- \nloped to the other flank of the squadron and \nshouted in a hoarse voice to the men to look to \ntheir pistols. He rode up to Kirsten. The staff \ncaptain on his broad-backed, steady mare came \nat a walk to meet him. His face with its long \nmustache was serious as always, only his eyes \nwere brighter than usual. \n\n"Well, what about it?" said he to Denfsov. \n"It won't come to a fight. You'll see we shall \nretire." \n\n"The devil only knows what they're about!" \nmuttered Denisov. "Ah, Wost6v," he cried no- \nticing the cadet's bright face, "you've got it at \nlast." \n\nAnd he smiled approvingly, evidently pleased \nwith the cadet. Rost6v felt perfectly happy. \nJust then the commander appeared on the \nbridge. Denisov galloped up to him. \n\n"Your excellency! Let us attack them! I'll \ndwive them off." \n\n"Attack indeed!" said the colonel in a bored \nvoice, puckering up his face as if driving off a \ntroublesome fly. "And why are you stopping \nhere? Don't you see the skirmishers are retreat- \ning? Lead the squadron back." \n\nThe squadron crossed the bridge and drew \nout of range of fire without having lost a single \nman. The second squadron that had been in \nthe front line followed them across and the last \nCossacks quitted the farther side of the river. \n\nThe two Pavlograd squadrons, having crossed \nthe bridge, retired up the hill one after the oth- \ner. Their colonel, Karl Bogddnich Schubert, \ncame up to Denisov's squadron and rode at a \nfootpace not far from Rost6v, without taking \nany notice of him although they were now \nmeeting for the first time since their encounter \nconcerning Telydnin. Rost6v, feeling that he \nwas at the front and in the power of a man to- \nward whom he now admitted that he had been \nto blame, did not lift his eyes from the colonel's \nathletic back, his nape covered with light hair, \nand his red neck. It seemed to Rost6v that Bog- \nddnich was only pretending not to notice him, \nand that his whole aim now was to test the \ncadet's courage, so he drew himself up and \nlooked around him merrily; then it seemed to \nhim that Bogddnich rode so near in order to \nshow him his courage. Next he thought that \nhis enemy would send the squadron on a des- \nperate attack just to punish him Rost6v. Then \nhe imagined how, after the attack, Bogdanich \nwould come up to him as he lay wounded and \n\n\n\nBOOK TWO \n\n\n\n79 \n\n\n\nwould magnanimously extend the hand of \nreconciliation. \n\nThe high-shouldered figure of Zherk6v, fa- \nmiliar to the Pavlograds as he had but recently \nleft their regiment, rode up to the colonel. Aft- \ner his dismissal from headquartersZherk6vhad \nnot remained in the regiment, saying he was \nnot such a fool as to slave at the front when he \ncould get more rewards by doing nothing on \nthe staff, and had succeeded in attaching him- \nself as an orderly officer to Prince Bagrati6n. \nHe now came to his former chief with an order \nfrom the commander of the rearguard. \n\n"Colonel," he said, addressing Rost6v's en- \nemy with an air of gloomy gravity and glanc- \ning round at his comrades, "there is an order \nto stop and fire the bridge." \n\n"An order to who?" asked the colonel mo- \nrosely. \n\n"I don't myself know 'to who,' " replied the \ncornet in a serious tone, "but the prince told \nme to 'go and tell the colonel that the hussars \nmust return quickly and fire the bridge.' " \n\nZherkov was followed by an officer of the \nsuite who rode up to the colonel of hussars \nwith the same order. After him the stout Nesvft- \nski came galloping up on a Cossack horse that \ncould scarcely carry his weight. \n\n"How's this, Colonel?" he shouted as he ap- \nproached. "I told you to fire the bridge, and \nnow someone has gone and blundered; they \nare all beside themselves over there and one \ncan't make anything out." \n\nThe colonel deliberately stopped the regi- \nment and turned to Nesvftski. \n\n"You spoke to me of inflammable material," \nsaid he, "but you said nothing about firing it." \n\n"But, my dear sir," said Nesvftski as he drew \nup, taking off his cap and smoothing his hair \nwet with perspiration with his plump hand, \n"wasn't I tellingyou to fire the bridge, when in- \nflammable material had been put in position?" \n\n"I am not your 'dear sir,' Mr. Staff Officer, \nand you did not tell me to burn the bridge 1 I \nknow the service, and it is my habit orders \nstrictly to obey. You said the bridge would be \nburned, but who would it burn, I could not \nknow by the holy spirit!" \n\n"Ah, that's always the wayl" said Nesvitski \nwith a wave of the hand. "How did you get \nhere?" said he, turning to 'Zherk6v. \n\n"On the same business. But you are damp! \nLet me wring you out!" \n\n"You were saying, Mr. Staff Officer . . ." con- \ntinued the colonel in an offended tone. \n\n"Colonel," interrupted the officer of the \n\n\n\nsuite, "you must be quick or the enemy will \nbring up his guns to use grapeshot." \n\nThe colonel looked silently at the officer of \nthe suite, at the stout staff officer, and at Zher- \nk6v, and he frowned. \n\n"I will the bridge fire," he said in a solemn \ntone as if to announce that in spite of all the \nunpleasantness he had to endure he would still \ndo the right thing. \n\nStriking his horse with his long muscular \nlegs as if it were to blame for everything, the \ncolonel moved forward and ordered the second \nsquadron, that in which Rostov was serving un- \nder Denfsov, to return to the bridge. \n\n"There, it's just as I thought," said Rost6v \nto himself. "He wishes to test me!" His heart \ncontracted and the blood rushed to his face. \n"Let him see whether I am a coward!" he \nthought. \n\nAgain on all the bright faces of the squadron \nthe serious expression appeared that they had \nworn when under fire. Rost6v watched his en- \nemy, the colonel, closely to find in his face \nconfirmation of his own conjecture, but the \ncolonel did not once glance at Rost6v, and \nlooked as he always did when at the front, sol- \nemn and stern. Then came the word of com- \nmand. \n\n"Look sharp! Look sharp!" several voices re- \npeated around him. \n\nTheir sabers catching in the bridles and their \nspurs jingling, the hussars hastily dismounted, \nnot knowing what they were to do. The men \nwere crossing themselves. Rostov no longer \nlooked at the colonel, he had no time. He was \nafraid of falling behind the hussars, so much \nafraid that his heart stood still. His hand trem- \nbled as he gave his horse into an orderly's \ncharge, and he felt the blood rush to his heart \nwith a thud. Denfsov rode past him, leaning \nback and shouting something. Rostov saw noth- \ning but the hussars running all around him, \ntheir spurs catching and their sabers clattering. \n\n"Stretchers!" shouted someone behind him. \n\nRost6v did not think what this call for \nstretchers meant; he ran on, trying only to be \nahead of the others; but just at the bridge, not \nlooking at the ground, he came on some sticky, \ntrodden mud, stumbled, and fell on his hands. \nThe others outstripped him. \n\n"At boss zides, Captain," he heard the voice \nof the colonel, who, having ridden ahead, had \npulled up his horse near the bridge, with a tri- \numphant, cheerful face. \n\nRost6v wiping his muddy hands on his \nbreeches looked at his enemy and was about to \n\n\n\n8o \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nrun on, thinking that the farther he went to the \nfront the better. But Bogdanich, without look- \ning at or recognizing Rost6v, shouted to him: \n\n"Who's that running on the middle of the \nbridge? To the right! Come back, Cadetl" he \ncried angrily; and turning to Denisov, who, \nshowing off his courage, had ridden on to the \nplanks of the bridge: \n\n"Why run risks, Captain? You should dis- \nmount," he said. \n\n"Oh, every bullet has its billet," answered \nVdska Denfsov, turning in his saddle. \n\nMeanwhile Nesvitski, Zherk6v, and the of- \nficer of the suite were standing together out of \nrange of the shots, watching, now the small \ngroup of men with yellow shakos, dark-green \njackets braided with cord, and blue riding \nbreeches, who were swarming near the bridge, \nand then at what was approaching in the dis- \ntance from the opposite side the blue uni- \nforms and groups with horses, easily recogniz- \nable as artillery. \n\n"Will they burn the bridge or not? Who'll \nget there first? Will they get there and fire the \nbridge or will the French get within grapeshot \nrange and wipe them out?" These were the \nquestions each man of the troops on the high \nground above the bridge involuntarily asked \nhimself with a sinking heart watching the \nbridge and the hussars in the bright evening \nlight and the blue tunics advancing from the \nother side with their bayonets and guns. \n\n"Ugh. The hussars will get it hotl" said Nes- \nvftski; "they are within grapeshot range now." \n\n"He shouldn't have taken so many men," \nsaid the officer of the suite. \n\n"True enough," answered Nesvitski; "two \nsmart fellows could have done the job just as \nwell." \n\n"Ah, your excellency," put in Zherk6v, his \neyes fixed on the hussars, but still with that \nnaive air that made i t impossible to know wheth- \ner he was speaking in jest or in earnest. "Ah, \nyour excellency 1 How you look at things! Send \ntwo men? And who then would give us the \nVladimir medal and ribbon? But now, even if \nthey do get peppered, the squadron may be \nrecommended for honors and he may get a rib- \nbon. Our Bogddnich knows how things are \ndone." \n\n"There now!" said the officer of the suite, \n"that's grapeshot." \n\nHe pointed to the French guns, the limbers \nof which were being detached and hurriedly \nremoved. \n\n\n\nOn the French side, amid the groups with \ncannon, a cloud of smoke appeared, then a sec- \nond and a third almost simultaneously, and at \nthe moment when the first report was heard a \nfourth was seen. Then two reports one after \nanother, and a third. \n\n"Oh! Ohl" groaned Nesvitski as if in fierce \npain, seizing the officer of the suite by the arm. \n"Look! A man has fallen! Fallen, fallen!" \n\n"Two, I think." \n\n"If I were Tsar I would never go to war," \nsaid Nesvitski, turning away. \n\nThe French guns were hastily reloaded. The \ninfantry in their blue uniforms advanced to- \nward the bridge at a run. Smoke appeared \nagain but at irregular intervals, and grapeshot \ncracked and rattled onto the bridge. But this \ntime Nesvitski could not see what was happen- \ning there, as a dense cloud of smoke arose from \nit. The hussars had succeeded in setting it on \nfire and the French batteries were now firing at \nthem, no longer to hinder them but because \nthe guns were trained and there was someone \nto fire at. \n\nThe French had time to fire three rounds of \ngrapeshot before the hussars got back to their \nhorses. Two were misdirected and the shot \nwent too high, but the last round fell in the \nmidst of a group of hussars and knocked three \nof them over. \n\nRost6v, absorbed by his relations with Bog- \nddnich, had paused on the bridge not knowing \nwhat to do. There was no one to hew down (as \nhe had always imagined battles to himself), nor \ncould he help to fire the bridge because he had \nnot brought any burning straw with him like \nthe other soldiers. He stood looking about him, \nwhen suddenly he heard a rattle on the bridge \nas if nuts were being spilt, and the hussar near- \nest to him fell against the rails with a groan. \nRost6v ran up to him with the others. Again \nsomeone shouted, "Stretchers!" Four men \nseized the hussar and began lifting him. \n\n"Oooh! For Christ's sake let me alone! "cried \nthe wounded man, but still he was lifted and \nlaid on the stretcher. \n\nNicholas Rost6v turned away and, as if \nsearching for something, gazed into the dis- \ntance, at the waters of the Danube, at the sky, \nand at the sun. How beautiful the sky looked; \nhow blue, how call , and how deep! How \nbright and glorious was the setting sun! With \nwhat soft glitter the waters of the distant Dan- \nube shone. And fairer stijl were the faraway \n. blue mountains beyond the/iver, the nunnery, \nthe mysterious gorges, and \ the pine forests \n\n\n\nBOOK TWO \n\n\n\n81 \n\n\n\nveiled in mist to their summits . . . There was \npeace and happiness ... "I should wish for \nnothing else, nothing, if only I were there," \nthought Rost6v. "In myself alone and in that \nsunshine there is so much happiness; but here \n. . . groans, suffering, fear, and this uncertainty \nand hurry . . . There they are shouting again, \nand again are all running back somewhere, and \nI shall run with them, and it, death, is here \nabove me and around . . . Another instant and \nI shall never again see the sun, this water, that \ngorgel ..." \n\nAt that instant the sun began to hide behind \nthe clouds, and other stretchers came into view \nbefore Rost6v. And the fear of death and of \nthe stretchers, and love of the sun and of life, \nall merged into one feeling of sickening agita- \ntion. \n\n"O Lord God! Thou who art in that heaven, \nsave, forgive, and protect me!" Rost6v whis- \npered. \n\nThe hussars ran back to the men who held \ntheir horses; their voices sounded louder and \ncalmer, the stretchers disappeared from sight. \n\n"Well, fwiend? So you've smelt powdah!" \nshouted Vdska Denfsov just above his ear. \n\n"It's all over; but I am a cowardyes, a cow- \nard!" thought Rost6v, and sighing deeply he \ntook Rook, his horse, which stood resting one \nfoot, from the orderly and began to mount. \n\n"Was that grapeshot?" he asked Denisov. \n\n"Yes and no mistake!" cried Denisov. "You \nworked likewegular bwicks and it's nasty work! \nAn attack's pleasant work! Hacking away at \nthe dogs! But this sort of thing is the very devil, \nwith them shooting at you like a target." \n\nAnd Denfsov rode up to a group that had \nstopped near Rost6v, composed of the colonel, \nNesvftski, Zherk6v, and the officer from the \nsuite. \n\n"Well, it seems that no one has noticed," \nthought Rost6v. And this was true. No one had \ntaken any notice, for everyone knew the sensa- \ntion which the cadet under fire for the first \ntime had experienced. \n\n"Here's something for you to report," said \nZherk6v. "See if I don't get promoted to a sub- \nlieutenancy." \n\n"Inform the prince that I the bridge fired!" \nsaid the colonel triumphantly and gaily. \n\n"And if he asks about the losses?" \n\n"A trifle/' said the colonel in his bass voice: \n"two hussars wounded, and one knocked out," \nhe added, unable to restrain a happy smile, \nand pronouncing the phrase "knocked out" \nwith ringing distinctness. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX \n\nPURSUED by the French army of a hundred \nthousand men under the command of Bona- \nparte, encountering a population that was un- \nfriendly to it, losing confidence in its allies, suf- \nfering from shortness of supplies, and compell- \ned to act under conditions of war unlike any- \nthing that had been foreseen, the Russian army \nof thirty-five thousand men commanded by Ku- \ntuzov was hurriedly retreating along the Dan- \nube, stopping where overtaken by the enemy \nand fighting rearguard actions only as far as \nnecessary to enable it to retreat without losing \nits heavy equipment. There had been actions \nat Lambach, Amstetten, and Melk; but despite \nthe courage and endurance acknowledged \neven by the enemy with which the Russians \nfought, the only consequence of these actions \nwas a yet more rapid retreat. Austrian troops \nthat had escaped capture at Ulm and had joined \nKutuzov at Braunau now separated from the \nRussian army, and Kutuzov was left with only \nhis own weak and exhausted forces. The de- \nfense of Vienna was no longer to be thought \nof. Instead of an offensive, the plan of which, \ncarefully prepared in accord with the modern \nscience of strategics, had been handed to Ku- \ntuzov when he was in Vienna by the Austrian \nHofkriegsrath, the sole and almost unattain- \nable aim remaining for him was to effect a \njunction with the forces that were advancing \nfrom Russia, without losing his army as Mack \nhad done at Ulm. \n\nOn the twenty-eighth of October Kutuzov \nwith his army crossed to the left bank of the \nDanube and took up a position for the first \ntime with the river between himself and the \nmain body of the French. On the thirtieth he \nattacked Mortier's division, which was on the \nleft bank, and broke it up. In this action for \nthe first time trophies were taken: banners, \ncannon, and two enemy generals. For the first \ntime, after a fortnight's retreat, the Russian \ntroops had halted and after a fight had not on- \nly held the field but had repulsed the French. \nThough the troops were ill-clad, exhausted, \nand had lost a third of their number in killed, \nwounded, sick, and stragglers; though a num- \nber of sick and wounded had been abandoned \non the other side of the Danube with a letter \nin which Kutuzov entrusted them to the hu- \nmanity of the enemy; and though the big hos- \npitals and the houses in Krems converted into \nmilitary hospitals could no longer accommo- \ndate all the sick and wounded, yet the stand \nmade at Krems and the victory over Mortier \n\n\n\n82 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nraised the spirits of the army considerably. \nThroughout the whole army and at headquar- \nters most joyful though erroneous rumors were \nrife of the imaginary approach of columns from \nRussia, of some victory gained by the Austri- \nans, and of the retreat of the frightened Bona- \nparte. \n\nPrince Andrew during the battle had been \nin attendance on the Austrian General Schmidt, \nwho was killed in the action. His horse had \nbeen wounded under him and his own arm \nslightly grazed by a bullet. As a mark of the \ncommander in chief's special favor he was sent \nwith the news of this victory to the Austrian \ncourt, now no longer at Vienna (which was \nthreatened by the French) but at Brunn. De- \nspite his apparently delicate build Prince An- \ndrew could endure physical fatigue far better \nthan many very muscular men, and on the \nnight of the battle, having arrived at Krems ex- \ncited but not weary, with dispatches from Dokh- \nturov to Kutiizov, he was sent immediately \nwith a special dispatch to Brunn. To be so sent \nmeant not only a reward but an important \nstep toward promotion. \n\nThe night was dark but starry, the road \nshowed black in the snow that had fallen the \nprevious day the day of the battle. Reviewing \nhis impressions of the recent battle, picturing \npleasantly to himself the impression his news \nof a victory would create, or recalling the send- \noff given him by the commander in chief and \nhis fellow officers, Prince Andrew was gallop- \ning along in a post chaise enjoying the feel- \nings of a man who has at length begun to at- \ntain a long-desired happiness. As soon as he \nclosed his eyes his ears seemed filled with the \nrattle of the wheels and the sensation of vic- \ntory. Then he began to imagine that the Rus- \nsians were running away and that he himself \nwas killed, but he quickly roused himself with \na feeling of joy, as if learning afresh that this \nwas not so but that on the contrary the French \nhad run away. He again recalled all the details \nof the victory and his own calm courage dur- \ning the battle, and feeling reassured he dozed \noff. . . . The dark starry night was followed by \na bright cheerful morning. The snow was thaw- \ning in the sunshine, the horses galloped quick- \nly, and on bqth sides of the road were forests \nof different kinds, fields, and villages. \n\nAt one of the post stations he overtook a \nconvoy of Russian wounded. The Russian of- \nficer in charge of the transport lolled back in \nthe front cart, shouting and scolding a soldier \nwith coarse abuse. In each of the long German \n\n\n\ncarts six or more pale, dirty, bandaged men \nwere being jolted over the stony road. Some of \nthem were talking (he heard Russian words), \nothers were eating bread; the more severely \nwounded looked silently, with the languid in- \nterest of sick children, at the envoy hurrying \npast them. \n\nPrince Andrew told his driver to stop, and \nasked a soldier in what action they had been \nwounded. "Day before yesterday, on the Dan- \nube," answered the soldier. Prince Andrew took \nout his purse and gave the soldier three gold \npieces. \n\n"That's for them all," he said to the officer \nwho came up. \n\n"Get well soon, lads!" he continued, turn- \ning to the soldiers. "There's plenty to do still." \n\n"What news, sir?" asked the officer, evidently \nanxious to start a conversation. \n\n"Good newsl ... Go on!" he shouted to the \ndriver, and they galloped on. \n\nIt was already quite dark when Prince An- \ndrew rattled over the paved streets of Briinn \nand found himself surrounded by high build- \nings, the lights of shops, houses, and street \nlamps, fine carriages, and all that atmosphere \nof a large and active town which is always so \nattractive to a soldier after camp life. Despite \nhis rapid journey and sleepless night, Prince \nAndrew when he drove up to the palace felt \neven more vigorous and alert than he had done \nthe day before. Only his eyes gleamed feverish- \nly and his thoughts followed one another with \nextraordinary clearness and rapidity. He again \nvividly recalled the details of the battle, no \nlonger dim, but definite and in the concise form \nin which he imagined himself stating them to \nthe Emperor Francis. He vividly imagined the \ncasual questions that might be put to him and \nthe answers he would give. He expected to be \nat once presented to the Emperor. At the chief \nentrance to the palace, however, an official came \nrunning out to meet him, and learning that he \nwas a special messenger led him to another en- \ntrance. \n\n"To the right from the corridor, Euer Hoch- \ngeboren! There you*will find the adjutant on \nduty," said the official. "He will conduct you to \nthe Minister of War." \n\nThe adjutant on duty, meeting Prince An- \ndrew, asked him to wait, and went in to the \nMinister of War. Five minutes later he returned \nand bowing with particular courtesy ushered \nPrince Andrew before him along a corridor to \nthe cabinet where the Minister of War was at \nwork. The adjutant by his elaborate courtesy \n\n\n\nBOOK \n\nappeared to wish to ward off any attempt at \nfamiliarity on the part o! the Russian messen- \nger. \n\nPrince Andrew's joyous feeling was consid- \nerably weakened as he approached the door of \nthe minister's room. He felt offended, and with- \nout his noticing it the feeling of offense im- \nmediately turned into one of disdain which \nwas quite uncalled for. His fertile mind in- \nstantly suggested to him a point of view which \ngave him a right to despise the adjutant and \nthe minister. "Away from the smell of powder, \nthey probably think it easy to gain victories!" \nhe thought. His eyes narrowed disdainfully, he \nentered the room of the Minister of War with \npeculiarly deliberate steps. This feeling of dis- \ndain was heightened when he saw the minister \nseated at a large table reading some papers and \nmaking pencil notes on them, and for the first \ntwo or three minutes taking no notice of his \narrival. A wax candle stood at each side of the \nminister's bent bald head with its gray temples. \nHe went on reading to the end, without rais- \ning his eyes at the opening of the door and the \nsound of footsteps. \n\n"Take this and deliver it," said he to his ad- \njutant, handing him the papers and still tak- \ning no notice of the special messenger. \n\nPrince Andrew felt that either the actions of \nKutuzov's army interested the Minister of War \nless than any of the other matters he was con- \ncerned with, or he wanted to give the Russian \nspecial messenger that impression. "But that is \na matter of perfect indifference to me," he \nthought. The minister drew the remaining \npapers together, arranged them evenly, and \nthen raised his head. He had an intellectual \nand distinctive head, but the instant he turned \nto Prince Andrew the firm, intelligent expres- \nsion on his face changed in a way evidently de- \nliberate and habitual to him. His face took on \nthe stupid artificial smile (which does not even \nattempt to hide its artificiality) of a man who is \ncontinually receiving many petitioners one aft- \ner another. \n\n"From General Field Marshal Kutiizov?" he \nasked. "I hope it is good ftews? There has been \nan encounter with Mortier? A victory? It was \nhigh timel" \n\nHe took the dispatch which was addressed to \nhim and began to read it with a mournful ex- \npression. \n\n"Oh, my God! My God! Schmidt!" he ex- \nclaimed in German. "What a calamity! What \na calamity!" \n\nHaving glanced through the dispatch he laid \n\n\n\nTWO 83 \n\nit on the table and looked at Prince Andrew, \nevidently considering something. \n\n"Ah, what a calamity! You say the affair was \ndecisive? But Mortier is not captured." Again \nhe pondered. "I am very glad you have brought \ngood news, though Schmidt's death is a heavy \nprice to pay for the victory. His Majesty will \nno doubt wish to see you, but not today. I thank \nyou! You must have a rest. Be at the levee to- \nmorrow after the parade. However, I will let \nyou know." \n\nThe stupid smile, which had left his face \nwhile he was speaking, reappeared. \n\n"Au revoir! Thank you very much. His Maj- \nesty will probably desire to see you," he added, \nbowing his head. \n\nWhen Prince Andrew left the palace-he felt \nthat all the interest and happiness the victory \nhad afforded him had been now left in the in- \ndifferent hands of the Minister of War and the \npolite adjutant. The whole tenor of his thoughts \ninstantaneously changed; the battle seemed the \nmemory of a remote event long past. \n\nCHAPTER X \n\nPRINCE ANDREW stayed at Briinn with Bilibin, \na Russian acquaintance of his in the diplomat- \nic service. \n\n"Ah, my dear prince! I could not haveamore \nwelcome visitor," said Bilibin as he came out \nto meet Prince Andrew. "Franz, put the prince's \nthings in my bedroom," said he to the servant \nwho was ushering Bolk6nski in. "So you're a \nmessenger of victory, eh? Splendid! And I am \nsitting here ill, as you see." \n\nAfter washing and dressing, Prince Andrew \ncame into the diplomat's luxurious study and \nsat down to the dinner prepared for him. Bili- \nbin settled down comfortably beside the fire. \n\nAfter his journey and the campaign during \nwhich he had been deprived of all the comforts \nof cleanliness and all the refinements of life, \nPrince Andrew felt a pleasant sense of repose \namong luxurious surroundings such as he had \nbeen accustomed to from childhood. Besides \nit was pleasant, after his reception by the Aus- \ntrians, to speak if not in Russian (for they \nwere speaking French) at least with a Russian \nwho would, he supposed, share the general Rus- \nsian antipathy to the Austrians which was then \nparticularly strong. \n\nBilibin was a man of thirty-five, a bachelor, \nand of the same circle as Prince Andrew. They \nhad known each other previously in Peters- \nburg, but had become more intimate when \nPrince Andrew was in Vienna with Kutuzov. \n\n\n\n84 \n\nJust as Prince Andrew was a young man who \ngave promise of rising high in the military pro- \nfession, so to an even greater extent Bilibin \ngave promise of rising in his diplomatic career. \nHe was still a young man but no longer a young \ndiplomat, as he had entered the service at the \nage of sixteen, had been in Paris and Copen- \nhagen, and now held a rather important post \nin Vienna. Both the foreign minister and our \nambassador in Vienna knew him and valued \nhim. He was not one of those many diplomats \nwho are esteemed because they have certain \nnegative qualities, avoid doing certain things, \nand speafc|*French. He was one of those, who, \nliking work, knew how to do it, and despite his \nindolence would sometimes spend a whole \nqight at his writing table. He worked equally \nwell whatever the import of his work. It was \nnot the question "What for?" but the question \n"How?" that interested him. What the diplo- \nmatic matter might be he did not care, but it \ngave him great pleasure to prepare a circular, \nmemorandum, or report, skillfully, pointedly, \nand elegantly. Bilfbin's services were valued \nnot only for what he wrote, but also for his \nskill in dealing and conversing with those in \nthe highest spheres. \n\nBilfbin liked conversation as he liked work, \nonly when it could be made elegantly witty. In \nsociety he always awaited an opportunity to \nsay something striking and took part in a con- \nversation only when that was possible. His con- \nversation was always sprinkled with wittily orig- \ninal, finished phrases of general interest. These \nsayings were prepared in the inner laboratory \nof his mind in a portable form as if intention- \nally, so that insignificant society people might \ncarry them from drawing room to drawing \nroom. And, in fact, Bilfbin's witticisms were \nhawked about in the Viennese drawing rooms \nand often had an influence on matters consid- \nered important. \n\nHis thin, worn, sallow face was covered with \ndeep wrinkles, which always looked as clean and \nwell washed as the tips of one's fingers after a \nRussian bath. The movement of these wrinkles \nformed the principal play of expression on his \nface. Now his forehead would pucker into deep \nfolds and his eyebrows were lifted, then his eye- \nbrows would descend and deep wrinkles would \ncrease his cheeks. His small, deep-set eyes al- \nways twinkled and looked out straight. \n\n"Well, now tell me about your 'exploits," \nsaid he. \n\nBolk6nski, very modestly without once men- \ntioning himself, described the engagement and \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\nhis reception by the Minister of War. \n\n"They received me and my news as one re- \nceives a dog in a game of skittles," said he in \nconclusion. \n\nBilibin smiled and the wrinkles on his face \ndisappeared. \n\n"Cependant, mon cher" he remarked, exam- \nining his nails from a distance and puckering \nthe skin above his left eye, "malgre 1 la haute es- \nthne que je professe pour the Orthodox Rus- \nsian army, j'avoue que votre victoire n'est pas \ndes plus victorieuses." a \n\nHe went on talking in this way in French, \nuttering only those words in Russian on which \nhe wished to put a contemptuous emphasis. \n\n"Come now! You with all your forces fall on \nthe unfortunate Mortier and his one division, \nand even then Mortier slips through your fin- \ngers 1 Where's the victory?" \n\n"But seriously," said Prince Andrew, "we \ncan at any rate say without boasting that it was \na little better than at Ulm . . ." \n\n"Why didn't you capture one, just one, mar- \nshal for us?" \n\n"Because not everything happens as one ex- \npects or with the smoothness of a parade. We \nhad expected, as I told you, to get at their rear \nby seven in the morning but had not reached \nit by five in the afternoon." \n\n"And why didn't you do it at seven in the \nmorning? You ought to have been there at sev- \nen in the morning," returned Bilfbin with a \nsmile. "You ought to have been there at seven \nin the morning." \n\n"Why did you not succeed in impressing on \nBonaparte by diplomatic methods that he had \nbetter leave Genoa alone?" retorted Prince \nAndrew in the same tone. \n\n"I know, "interrupted Bilfbin, "you're think- \ning it's very easy to take marshals, sitting on a \nsofa by the fire! That is true, but still why \ndidn't you capture him? So don't be surprised \nif not only the Minister of War but also his \nMost August Majesty the Emperor and King \nFrancis is not much delighted by your victory. \nEven I, a poor secretary of the Russian Em- \nbassy, do not feel any need in token of my \njoy to give my Franz a thaler, or let him go \nwith his Liebchen to the Prater. . . . True, \nwe have no Prater here . . ." \n\nHe looked straight at Prince Andrew and \nsuddenly unwrinkled his forehead. \n\n"It is now my turn to ask you 'why?' mon \n\n1 "But, my dear fellow, with all my respect for \nthe Orthodox Russian army, I must say that your \nvictory was not particularly victorious." \n\n\n\nBOOK \n\ncher" said Bolk6nski. "I confess I do not un- \nderstand: perhaps there are diplomatic subtle- \nties here beyond my feeble intelligence, but I \ncan't make it out. Mack loses a whole army, \nthe Archduke Ferdinand and the Archduke \nKarl give no signs of life and make blunder after \nblunder. Kutuzov alone at last gains a real vic- \ntory, destroying the spell of the invincibility of \nthe French, and the Minister of War does not \neven care to hear the details." \n\n"That's just it, my dear fellow. You see it's \nhurrah for the Tsar, for Russia, for the Ortho- \ndox Greek faith! All that is beautiful, but what \ndo we, I mean the Austrian court, care for your \nvictories? Bring us nice news of a victory by the \nArchduke Karl or Ferdinand (one archduke's \nas good as another, as you know) and even if it \nis only over a fire brigade of Bonaparte's, that \nwill be another story and we'll fire off some \ncannon! But this sort of thing seems done on \npurpose to vex us. The Archduke Karl does \nnothing, the Archduke Ferdinand disgraces \nhimself. You abandon Vienna, give up its de- \nfenseas much as to say: 'Heaven is with us, \nbut heaven help you and your capital!' The \none general whom we all loved, Schmidt, you \nexpose to a bullet, and then you congratulate \nus on the victory! Admit that more irritating \nnews than yours could not have been conceived. \nIt's as if it had been done on purpose, on pur- \npose. Besides, suppose you did gain a brilliant \nvictory, if even the Archduke Karl gained a \nvictory, what effect would that have on the \ngeneral course of events? It's too late now when \nVienna is occupied by the French army!" \n\n"What? Occupied? Vienna occupied?" \n\n"Not only occupied, but Bonaparte is at \nSchonbrunn, and the count, our dear Count \nVrbna, goes to him for orders." \n\nAfter the fatigues and impressions of the \njourney, his reception, and especially after hav- \ning dined, Bolk6nski felt that he could not take \nin the full significance of the words he heard. \n\n"Count Lichtenfels was here this morning," \nBilibin continued, "and showed me a letter in \nwhich the parade of the French in Vienna was \nfully described: Prince Murat et tout le trem- \nblement . . . You see that your victory is not a \nmatter for great rejoicing and that you can't \nbe received as a savior." \n\n"Really I don't care about that, I don't care \nat all," said Prince Andrew, beginning to un- \nderstand that his news of the battle before \nKrems was really of small importance in view \nof such events as the fall of Austria's capital. \n"How is it Vienna was taken? What of the \n\n\n\nTWO 85 \n\nbridge and its celebrated bridgehead and Prince \nAuersperg? We heard reports that Prince Au- \nersperg was defending Vienna?" he said. \n\n"Prince Auersperg is on this, on our side of \nthe river, and is defending us doing it very \nbadly, I think, but still he is defending us. But \nVienna is on the other side. No, the bridge has \nnot yet been taken and I hope it will not be, \nfor it is mined and orders have been given to \nblow it up. Otherwise we should long ago have \nbeen in the mountains of Bohemia, and you \nand your army would have spent a bad quarter \nof an hour between two fires." \n\n"But still this does not mean that the cam- \npaign is over," said Prince Andrew. \n\n"Well, I think it is. The bigwigs here think \nso too, but they daren't say so. It will be as I \nsaid at the beginning of the campaign, it won't \nbe your skirmishing at Durrenstein, or gun- \npowder at all, that will decide the matter, but \nthose who devised it," said Bilfbin quoting one \nof his own mots, releasing the wrinkles on his \nforehead, and pausing. "The only question is \nwhat will come of the meeting between the Em- \nperor Alexander and the King of Prussia in \nBerlin? If Prussia joins the Allies, Austria's \nhand will be forced and there will be war. If \nnot it is merely a question of settling where the \npreliminaries of the new Campo Formio are to \nbe drawn up." \n\n"What an extraordinary genius!" Prince An- \ndrew suddenly exclaimed, clenching his small \nhand and striking the table with it, "and what \nluck the man has!" \n\n"Buonaparte?" said Bilfbin inquiringly, \npuckering up his forehead to indicate that he \nwas about to say something witty. "Buona- \nparte?" he repeated, accentuating the u: "I \nthink, however, now that he lays down laws for \nAustria at Schonbrunn, il faut lui faire grace \nde I'u! * I shall certainly adopt an innovation \nand call him simply Bonapartel" \n\n"But joking apart," said Prince Andrew, "do \nyou really think the campaign is over?" \n\n"This is what I think. Austria has been made \na fool of, and she is not used to it. She will retal- \niate. And she has been fooled in the first place \nbecause her provinces have been pillaged \nthey say the Holy Russian army loots terribly \nher army is destroyed, her capital taken, and \nall this for the beaux yeux * of His Sardinian \nMajesty. And therefore this is between our- \nselves I instinctively feel that we are being de- \nceived, my instinct tells me of negotiations with \n\n1 "We must let him off the u/" \n8 Fine eyes. \n\n\n\n86 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nFrance and projects for peace, a secret peace \nconcluded separately." \n\n"Impossible!" cried Prince Andrew. "That \nwould be too base." \n\n"If we live we shall see," replied Bilibin, his \nface again becoming smooth as a sign that the \nconversation was at an end. \n\nWhen Prince Andrew reached the room pre- \npared for him and lay down in a clean shirt on \nthe feather bed with its warmed and fragrant \npillows, he felt that the battle of which he had \nbrought tidings was far, far away from him. \nThe alliance with Prussia, Austria's treachery, \nBonaparte's new triumph, tomorrow's levee \nand parade, and the audience with the Emper- \nor Francis occupied his thoughts. \n\nHe closed his eyes, and immediately a sound \nof cannonading, of musketry and the rattling \nof carriage wheels seemed to fill his ears, and \nnow again drawn out in a thin line the mus- \nketeers were descending the hill, the French \nwere firing, and he felt his heart palpitating as \nhe rode forward beside Schmidt with the bul- \nlets merrily whistling all around, and he ex- \nperienced tenfold the joy of living, as he had \nnot done since childhood. \n\nHe woke up ... \n\n"Yes, that all happened!" he said, and, smil- \ning happily to himself like a child, he fell into \na deep, youthful slumber. \n\nCHAPTER XI \n\nNEXT DAY he woke late. Recalling his recent \nimpressions, the first thought that came into \nhis mind was that today he had to be presented \nto the Emperor Francis; he remembered the \nMinister of War, the polite Austrian adjutant, \nBilibin, and last night's conversation. Having \ndressed for his attendance at court in full pa- \nrade uniform, which he had not worn for a \nlong time, he went into Bilibin's study fresh, \nanimated, and handsome, with his hand band- \naged. In the study were four gentlemen of the \ndiplomatic corps. With Prince Hippolyte Ku- \nragin, who was a secretary to the embassy, Bol- \nk6nski was already acquainted. Bilibin intro- \nduced him to the others. \n\nThe gentlemen assembled at Bilfbin's were \nyoung, wealthy, gay society men, who here, as \nin Vienna, formed a special set which Bilibin, \ntheir leader, called les ndtres* This set, consist- \ning almost exclusively of diplomats, evidently \nhad its own interests which had nothing to do \nwith war or politics but related to high society, \nto certain women, and to the official side of the \n\n1 Ours. \n\n\n\nservice. These gentlemen received Prince An- \ndrew as one of themselves, an honor they did \nnot extend to many. From politeness and to \nstart conversation, they asked him a few ques- \ntions about the army and the battle, and then \nthe talk went off into merry jests and gossip. \n\n"But the best of it was," said one, telling of \nthe misfortune of a fellow diplomat, "that the \nChancellor told him flatly that his appoint- \nment to London was a promotion and that he \nwas so to regard it. Can you fancy the figure he \ncut? . . ." \n\n"But the worst of it, gentlemen I am giving \nKunigin away to you is that that man suffers, \nand this Don Juan, wicked fellow, is taking ad- \nvantage of it!" \n\nPrince Hippolyte was lolling in a lounge \nchair with his legs over its arm. He began to \nlaugh. \n\n"Tell me about that!" he said. \n\n"Oh, you Don Juan! You serpent!" cried sev- \neral voices. \n\n"You, Bolk6nski, don't know," said Bilibin \nturning to Prince Andrew, "that all the atroci- \nties of the French army (I nearly said of the \nRussian army) are nothing compared to what \nthis man has been doing among the women!" \n\n"La femme est la compagne de I'homme" 2 \nannounced Prince Hippolyte, and began look- \ning through a lorgnette at his elevated legs. \n\nBilibin and the rest of "ours" burst out laugh- \ning in Hippolyte's face, and Prince Andrew \nsaw that Hippolyte, of whomhe had to admit \nhe had almost been jealous on his wife's ac- \ncount, was the butt of this set. \n\n"Oh, I must give you a treat," Bilfbin whis- \npered to Bolk6nski. "Kuragin is exquisite when \nhe discusses politics you should see his grav- \nity!" \n\nHe sat down beside Hippolyte and wrink- \nling his forehead began talking to him about \npolitics. Prince Andrew and the others gath- \nered round these two. \n\n"The Berlin cabinet cannot express a feel- \ning of alliance," began Hippolyte gazing round \nwith importance at the others, "without ex- \npressing ... as in its last note . . . you under- \nstand . . . Besides, unless His Majesty the Em- \nperor derogates from the principle of our \nalliance . . . \n\n"Wait, I have not finished . . ." he said to \nPrince Andrew, seizing him by the arm, "I be- \nlieve that intervention will be stronger than \nnonintervention. And . . ."he paused. "Final- \nly one cannot impute the nonreceipt of ourdis- \n\n2 "Woman is man's companion." \n\n\n\nBOOK TWO \n\n\n\n87 \n\n\n\npatch of November 18. That is how it will \nend." And he released Bolk6nski's arm to in- \ndicate that he had now quite finished. \n\n"Demosthenes, I know thee by the pebble \nthou secretest in thy golden mouth 1" said Bilf- \nbin, and the mop of hair on his head moved \nwith satisfaction. \n\nEverybody laughed, and Hippolyte louder \nthan anyone. He was evidently distressed, and \nbreathed painfully, but could not restrain the \nwild laughter that convulsed his usually impas- \nsive features. \n\n"Well now, gentlemen," said Bilibin, "Bol- \nk6nski is my guest in this house and in Briinn \nitself. I want to entertain him as far as I can, \nwith all the pleasures of life here. If we were in \nVienna it would be easy, but here, in this \nwretched Moravian hole, it is more difficult, \nand I beg you all to help me. Briinn's attrac- \ntions must be shown him. You can undertake \nthe theater, I society, and you, Hippolyte, of \ncourse the women." \n\n"We must let him see Amelie, she's exqui- \nsitel" said one of "ours," kissing his finger tips. \n\n"In general we must turn this bloodthirsty \nsoldier to more humane interests," said Bilibin. \n\n"I shall scarcely be able to avail myself of \nyour hospitality, gentlemen, it is already time \nfor me to go," replied Prince Andrew looking \nat his watch. \n\n"Where to?" \n\n"To the Emperor." \n\n"Oh! Ohl Oh!" \n\n"Well, au revoir, Bolk6nskil Au revoir, \nPrince! Come back early to dinner," cried sev- \neral voices. "We'll take you in hand." \n\n"When speaking to the Emperor, try as far \nas you can to praise the way that provisions are \nsupplied and the routes indicated," said Bilibin, \naccompanying him to the hall. \n\n"I should like to speak well of them, but as \nfar as I know the facts, I can't," replied Bolk6n- \nski, smiling. \n\n"Well, talk as much as you can, anyway. He \nhas a passion for giving audiences, but he does \nnot like talking himself and can't do it, as you \nwill see/' \n\nCHAPTER XII \n\nAT THE LEVEE Prince Andrew stood among the \nAustrian officers as he had been told to, and the \nEmperor Francis merely looked fixedly into his \nface and just nodded to him with his long head. \nBut after it was over, the adjutant he had seen \nthe previous day ceremoniously informed Bol- \nk6nski that the Emperor desired to give him \n\n\n\nan audience. The Emperor Francis received \nhim standing in the middle of the room. Be- \nfore the conversation began Prince Andrew \nwas struck by the fact that the Emperor seemed \nconfused and blushed as if not knowing what \nto say. \n\n"Tell me, when did the battle begin?" he \nasked hurriedly. \n\nPrince Andrew replied. Then followed oth- \ner questions just as simple: "Was Kutuzov well? \nWhen had he left Krems?" and so on. The Em- \nperor spoke as if his sole aim were to put a giv- \nen number of questions the answers to these \nquestions, as was only too evident, did not in- \nterest him. \n\n"At what o'clock did the battle begin?" asked \nthe Emperor. \n\n"I cannot inform Your Majesty at what \no'clock the battle began at the front, but at \nDurrenstein, where I was, our attack began aft- \ner five in the afternoon," replied Bolk6nski \ngrowing more animated and expecting that he \nwould have a chance to give a reliable account, \nwhich he had ready in his mind, of all he knew \nand had seen. But the Emperor smiled and in- \nterrupted him. \n\n"How many miles?" \n\n"From where to where, Your Majesty?" \n\n"From Durrenstein to Krems." \n\n"Three and a half miles, Your Majesty." \n\n"The French have abandoned the left bank?" \n\n"According to the scouts the last of them \ncrossed on rafts during the night." \n\n"Is there sufficient forage in Krems?" \n\n"Forage has not been supplied to the ex- \ntent . . ." \n\nThe Emperor interrupted him. \n\n"At what o'clock was General Schmidt \nkilled?" \n\n"At seven o'clock, I believe." \n\n"At seven o'clock? It's very sad, very sad!" \n\nThe Emperor thanked Prince Andrew and \nbowed. Prince Andrew withdrew and was im- \nmediately surrounded by courtiers on all sides. \nEverywhere he saw friendly looks and heard \nfriendly words. Yesterday's adjutant re- \nproached him for not having stayed at the pal- \nace, and offered him his own house. The Min- \nister of War came up and congratulated him \non the Maria Theresa Orderof the third grade, \nwhich the Emperor was conferring on him. The \nEmpress' chamberlain invited him to see Her \nMajesty. The archduchess also wished to see \nhim. He did not know whom to answer, and for \na few seconds collected his thoughts. Then the \nRussian ambassador took him by the shoulder, \n\n\n\n88 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nled him to the window, and began to talk to \nhim. \n\nContrary to Bilibin's forecast the news he \nhad brought was joyfully received. A thanks- \ngiving service was arranged, Kutiizov was a- \nwarded the Grand Cross of Maria Theresa, and \nthe whole army received rewards. Bolk6nski \nwas invited everywhere, and had to spend the \nwhole morning calling on the principal Austri- \nan dignitaries. Between four and five in the aft- \nernoon, having made all his calls, he was re- \nturning to Bilibin's house thinking out a let- \nter to his father about the battle and his visit \nto Brunn. At the door he found a vehicle half \nfull of luggage. Franz, Bilibin's man, was drag- \nging a portmanteau with some difficulty out of \nthe front door. \n\nBefore returning to Bilibin's Prince Andrew \nhad gone to a bookshop to provide himself with \nsome books for the campaign, and had spent \nsome time in the shop. \n\n"What is it?" he asked. \n\n"Oh, your excellency 1" said Franz, with diffi- \nculty rolling the portmanteau into the vehicle, \n"we are to move on still farther. The scoundrel \nis again at our heels!" \n\n"Eh? What?" asked Prince Andrew. \n\nBilibin came out to meet him. His usually \ncalm face showed excitement. \n\n"There now! Confess that this is delightful," \nsaid he. "This affair of the Thabor Bridge, at \nVienna. . . . They have crossed without striking \na blow!" \n\nPrince Andrew could not understand. \n\n"But where do you come from not to know \nwhat every coachman in the town knows?" \n\n"I come from the archduchess'. I heard noth- \ning there." \n\n"And you didn't see that everybody is pack- \ning up?" \n\n"I did not . . . What is it all about?" inquired \nPrince Andrew impatiently. \n\n"What's it all about? Why, the French have \ncrossed the bridge that Auersperg was defend- \ning, and the bridge was not blown up: so Murat \nis now rushing along the road to Brunn and \nwill be here in a day or two." \n\n"What? Here? But why did they not blow up \nthe bridge, if it was mined?" \n\n"That is what I ask you. No one, not even \nBonaparte, knows why." \n\nBolk6nski shrugged his shoulders. \n\n"But if the bridge is crossed it means that the \narmy too is lost? It will be cut off," said he. \n\n"That's just it," answered Bilibin. "Listen! \nThe French entered Vienna as I told you. Very \n\n\n\nwell. Next day, which was yesterday, those gen- \ntlemen, messieurs les marechaux* Murat, Lan- \nnes, and Belliard, mount and ride to the bridge. \n(Observe that all three are Gascons.) 'Gentle- \nmen,' says one of them, 'you know the Thabor \nBridge is mined and doubly mined and that \nthere are menacing fortifications at its head and \nan army of fifteen thousand men has been or- \ndered to blow up the bridge and not let us \ncross? But it will please our sovereign the Em- \nperor Napoleon if we take this bridge, so let \nus three go and take it!' 'Yes, let's!' say the oth- \ners. And off they go and take the bridge, cross \nit, and now with their whole army are on this \nside of the Danube, marching on us, you, and \nyour lines of communication." \n\n"Stop jesting," said Prince Andrew sadly and \nseriously. This news grieved him and yet he was \npleased. \n\nAs soon as he learned that the Russian army \nwas in such a hopeless situation it occurred to \nhim that it was he who was destined to lead it \nout of this position; that here was the Toulon \nthat would lift him from the ranks of obscure \nofficers and offer him the first step to fame! Lis- \ntening to Bilfbin he was already imagining how \non reaching the army he would give an opin- \nion at the war council which would be the only \none that could save the army, and how he alone \nwould be entrusted with the executing of the \nplan. \n\n"Stop this jesting," he said. \n\n"I am not jesting," Bilibin went on. "Noth- \ning is truer or sadder. These gentlemen ride \nonto the bridge alone and wave white hand- \nkerchiefs; they assure the officer on duty that \nthey, the marshals, are on their way to negoti- \nate with Prince Auersperg. He lets them enter \nthe tSte-de-pont* They spin him a thousand \ngasconades, saying that the war is over, that the \nEmperor Francis is arranging a meeting with \nBonaparte, that they desire to see Prince Auers- \nperg, and so on. The officer sends for Auers- \nperg; these gentlemen embrace the officers, \ncrack jokes, sit on the cannon, and meanwhile \na French battalion gets to the bridge un- \nobserved, flings the bags of incendiary material \ninto the water, and approaches the tSte-de- \npont. At length appears the lieutenant gener- \nal, our dear Prince Auersperg von Mautern \nhimself. 'Dearest foe! Flower of the Austrian \narmy, hero of the Turkish wars! Hostilities are \nended, we can shake one another's hand. . . . \nThe Emperor Napoleon burns with impatience \n\n1 The marshals. \n9 Bridgehead. \n\n\n\nBOOK TWO \n\n\n\nto make Prince Auersperg's acquaintance/ In a \nword, those gentlemen, Gascons indeed, so be- \nwildered him with fine words, and he is so flat- \ntered by his rapidly established intimacy with \nthe French marshals, and so dazzled by the sight \nof Murat's mantle and ostrich plumes, qu'il n'y \nvoit quedu feu,et oubliecelui qu'il devait faire \nfaire sur Vennemi!" * In spite of the animation \nof his speech, Bilibin did not forget to pause \nafter this mot to give time for its due apprecia- \ntion. "The French battalion rushes to the \nbridgehead, spikes the guns, and the bridge is \ntaken 1 But what is best of all," he went on, his \nexcitement subsiding under the delightful in- \nterest of his own story, "is that the sergeant in \ncharge of the cannon which was to give the sig- \nnal to fire the mines and blow up the bridge, this \nsergeant, seeing that the French troops were \nrunning onto the bridge, was about to fire, but \nLannes stayed his hand. The sergeant, who was \nevidently wiser than his general, goes up to \nAuersperg and says: 'Prince, you are being de- \nceived, here are the French!' Murat, seeing that \nall is lost if the sergeant is allowed to speak, \nturns to Auersperg with feigned astonishment \n(he is a true Gascon) and says: 'I don't recog- \nnize the world-famous Austrian discipline, if \nyou allow a subordinate to address you like \nthat I' It was a stroke of genius. Prince Auers- \nperg feels his dignity at stake and orders the \nsergeant to be arrested. Come, you must own \nthat this affair of the Thabor Bridge is delight- \nful! It is not exactly stupidity, nor rascality " \n\n"It may be treachery," said Prince Andrew, \nvividly imagining the gray overcoats, wounds, \nthe smoke of gunpowder, the sounds of firing, \nand the glory that awaited him. \n\n"Not that either. That puts the court in too \nbad a light," replied Bilibin. "It's not treachery \nnor rascality nor stupidity: it is just as at Ulm \n... it is .. ."he seemed to be trying to find the \nright expression. "C'est . . . c'est du Mack. Nous \nsommes mackJs [It is ... it is a bit of Mack. We \nare Macked]" he concluded, feeling that he \nhad produced a good epigram, a fresh one that \nwould be repeated. His hitherto puckered \nbrow became smooth as a sign of pleasure, and \nwith a slight smile he began to examine his \nnails. \n\n"Where are you off to?" he said suddenly to \nPrince Andrew who had risen and was going \ntoward his room. \n\n"I am going away." \n\n"Where to?" \n\n1 That their fire gets into his eyes and he forgets \nthat he ought to be firing at the enemy. \n\n\n\n"To the army." \n\n"But you meant to stay another two days?" \n\n"But now I am off at once." \n\nAnd Prince Andrew after giving directions \nabout his departure went to his room. \n\n"Do you know, mon cher" said Bilfbin fol- \nlowing him, "1 have been thinking about you. \nWhy are you going?" \n\nAnd in proof of the conclusiveness of his \nopinion all the wrinkles vanished from his face. \n\nPrince Andrew looked inquiringly at him \nand gave no reply. \n\n"Why are you going? I know you think it \nyour duty to gallop back to the army now that \nit is in danger. I understand that. Mon cher, it \nis heroism!" \n\n"Not at all," said Prince Andrew. \n\n"But as you are a philosopher, be a consist- \nent one, look at the other side of the question \nand you will see that your duty, on the con- \ntrary, is to take care of yourself. Leave it to \nthose who are no longer fit for anything else. \n. . . You have not been ordered to return and \nhave not been dismissed from here; therefore, \nyou can stay and go with us wherever our ill- \nluck takes us. They say we are going to Olmiitz, \nand Olmiitz is a very decent town. You and I \nwill travel comfortably in my caliche." \n\n"Do stop joking, Bilibin," cried Bolk6nski. \n\n"I am speaking sincerely as a friend! Consid- \ner! Where and why are you going, when you \nmight remain here? You are faced by one of \ntwo things," and the skin over his left temple \npuckered, "either you will not reach your reg- \niment before peace is concluded, or you will \nshare defeat and disgrace with Kutuzov's whole \narmy." \n\nAnd Bilfbin unwrinkled his temple, feeling \nthat the dilemma was insoluble. \n\n"I cannot argue about it," replied Prince \nAndrew coldly, but he thought: "I am going to \nsave the army." \n\n"My dear fellow, you are a hero!" said Bili- \nbin. \n\nCHAPTER XIII \n\nTHAT SAME NIGHT, having taken leave of the \nMinister of War, Bolkonski set off to rejoin the \narmy, not knowing where he would find it and \nfearing to be-'captured by the French on the \nway to Krems. \n\nIn Briinn everybody attached to the court \nwas packing up, and the heavy baggage was al- \nready being dispatched to Olmutz. Near Het- \nzelsdorf Prince Andrew struck the highroad \nalong which the Russian army was moving \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nwith great haste and in the greatest disorder. \nThe road was so obstructed with carts that it \nwas impossible to get by in a carriage. Prince \nAndrew took a horse and a Cossack from a Cos- \nsack commander, and hungry and weary, mak- \ning his way past the baggage wagons, rode in \nsearch of the commander in chief and of hisown \nluggage. Very sinister reports of the position of \nthe army reached him as he went along, and \nthe appearance of the troops in their disorder- \nly flight confirmed these rumors. \n\n"Cette armJe russe que I' or de I'Angleterre \na transport^ des extrJmites de Vunivers, nous \nallons lui faire eprouver le meme sort(le sort \nde I'armee d'Ulm)."* He remembered these \nwords in Bonaparte's address to his army at the \nbeginning of the campaign, and they awoke in \nhim astonishment at the genius of his hero, a \nfeeling of wounded pride, and a hope of glory. \n"And should there be nothing left but to die?" \nhe thought. "Well, if need be, I shall do it no \nworse than others." \n\nHe looked with disdain at the endless con- \nfused mass of detachments, carts, guns, artillery, \nand again baggage wagons and vehicles of all \nkinds overtaking one another and blocking \nthe muddy road, three and sometimes four \nabreast. From all sides, behind and before, as \nfar as ear could reach, there were the rattle of \nwheels, the creaking of carts and gun carriages, \nthe tramp of horses, the crack of whips, shouts, \nthe urging of horses, and the swearing of sol- \ndiers, orderlies, and officers. All along the sides \nof the road fallen horses were to be seen, some \nflayed, some not, and broken-down carts be- \nsidewhich solitary soldiers sat waiting forsome- \nthing, and again soldiers straggling from their \ncompanies, crowds of whom set off to the neigh- \nboring villages, or returned from them drag- \nging sheep, fowls, hay, and bulging sacks. At \neach ascent or descent of the road the crowds \nwere yet denser and the din of shouting more \nincessant. Soldiers floundering knee-deep in \nmud pushed the guns and wagons themselves. \nWhips cracked, hoofs slipped, traces broke, and \nlungs were strained with shouting. The offi- \ncers directing the march rode backward and \nforward between the carts. Their voices were \nbut feebly heard amid the uproar and one saw \nby their faces that they despaired of the possi- \nbility of checking this disorder. \n\n"Here is our dear Orthodox Russian army," \n\n14i That Russian army which has been brought \nfrom the ends of the earth by English gold, we \nshall cause to share the same fate (the fate of the \narmy at Ulm)." \n\n\n\nthought Bolk6nski, recalling Bilibin's words. \n\nWishing to find outwhere the commanderin \nchief was, he rode up to a convoy. Directly op- \nposite to him came a strange one-horse vehicle, \nevidently rigged up by soldiers out of any \navailable materials and looking like some- \nthing between a cart, a cabriolet, and a cateche. \nA soldier was driving, and a woman enveloped \nin shawls sat behind the apron under the leath- \ner hood of the vehicle. Prince Andrew rode up \nand was just putting his question to a soldier \nwhen his attention was diverted by the desper- \nate shrieks of the woman in the vehicle. An of- \nficer in charge of transport was beating the \nsoldier who was driving the woman's vehicle \nfor trying to get ahead of others, and the strokes \nof his whip fell on the apron of the equipage. \nThe woman screamed piercingly. Seeing Prince \nAndrew she leaned out from behind the apron \nand, waving her thin arms from under the wool- \nen shawl, cried: \n\n"Mr. Aide-de-camp! Mr. Aide-de-camp! . . . \nFor heaven's sake . . . Protect me! What will be- \ncome of us? I am the wife of the doctor of the \n\nSeventh Chasseurs They won't let us pass, \n\nwe are left behind and have lost our people . . ." \n\n"I'll flatten you into a pancake!" shouted the \nangry officer to the soldier. "Turn back with \nyour slut I" \n\n"Mr. Aide-de-camp! Help me! . . . What does \nit all mean?" screamed the doctor's wife. \n\n"Kindly let this cart pass. Don't you see it's \na woman?" said Prince Andrew ridingup to the \nofficer. \n\nThe officer glanced at him, and without re- \nplying turned again to the soldier. "I'll teach \nyou to push on! , . . Back!" \n\n"Let them pass, I tell youl" repeated Prince \nAndrew, compressing his lips. \n\n"And who are you?" cried the officer, turning \non him with tipsy rage, "who are you? Are you \nin command here? Eh? I am commander here, \nnot you! Go back or I'll flatten you into a pan- \ncake," repeated he. This expression evidently \npleased him. \n\n"That was a nice snub for the little aide-de- \ncamp," came a voice from behind. \n\nPrince Andrew saw that the officer was in \nthat state of senseless, tipsy rage when a man \ndoes not know what he is saying. He saw that \nhis championship of the doctor's wife in her \nqueer trap might expose him to what he dread- \ned more than anything in the world to ridi- \ncule; but his instinct urged him on. Before the \nofficer finished his sentence Prince Andrew, his \nface distorted with fury, rode up to him and \n\n\n\nBOOK \n\nraised his riding whip. \n\n"Kind . . . ly let them pass!" \n\nThe officer flourished his arm and hastily \nrode away. \n\n"It's all the fault of these fellows on the staff \nthat there's this disorder," he muttered. "Do as \nyou like." \n\nPrince Andrew without lifting his eyes rode \nhastily away from the doctor's wife, who was \ncalling him her deliverer, and recalling with a \nsense of disgust the minutest details of this hu- \nmiliating scene he galloped on to the village \nwhere he was told that the commander in chief \nwas. \n\nOn reaching the village he dismounted and \nwent to the nearest house, intending to rest if \nbut for a moment, eat something, and try to \nsort out the stinging and tormenting thoughts \nthat confused his mind. "This is a mob of \nscoundrels and not an army," he was thinking \nas he went up to the window of the first house, \nwhen a familiar voice called him by name. \n\nHe turned round. Nesvitski's handsome face \nlooked out of the little window. Nesvftski, mov- \ning his moist lips as he chewed something, and \nflourishing his arm, called him to enter. \n\n"Bolk6nski! Bolk6nski! . . . Don't you hear? \nEh? Come quick . . ." he shouted. \n\nEntering the house, Prince Andrew saw Nes- \nvftski and another adjutant having something \nto eat. They hastily turned round to him ask- \ning if he had any news. On their familiar faces \nhe read agitation and alarm. This was particu- \nlarly noticeable on Nesvitski's usually laugh- \ning countenance. \n\n"Where is the commander in chief?" asked \nBolk6nski. \n\n"Here, in that house," answered the adju- \ntant. \n\n"Well, is it true that it's peace and capitula- \ntion?" asked Nesvftski. \n\n"I was going to ask you. I know nothing ex- \ncept that it was all I could do to get here." \n\n"And we, my dear boy! It's terrible! 1 was \nwrong to laugh at Mack, we're getting it still \nworse," said Nesvftski. "But sit down and have \nsomething to eat." \n\n"You won't be able to find either your bag- \ngage or anything else now, Prince. And God \nonly knows where your man Peter is," said the \nother adjutant. \n\n"Where are headquarters?" \n\n"We are to spend the night in Znaim." \n\n"Well, I have got all I need into packs for \ntwo horses," said Nesvftski. "They've made up \nsplendid packs for me fit to cross the Bohe- \n\n\n\nTWO 91 \n\nmian mountains with. It's a bad lookout, old \nfellow! But what's the matter with you? You \nmust be ill to shiver like that," he added, no- \nticing that Prince Andrew winced as at an elec- \ntric shock. \n\n"It's nothing," replied Prince Andrew. \n\nHe had just remembered his recent encoun- \nter with the doctor's wife and the convoy offi- \ncer. \n\n"What is the commander in chief doing \nhere?" he asked. \n\n"I can't make out at all," said Nesvitski. \n\n"Well, all I canmakeout is that everything is \nabominable, abominable, quite abominable!" \nsaid Prince Andrew, and he went off to the \nhouse where the commander in chief was. \n\nPassing by Kutiizov's carriage and the ex- \nhausted saddle horses of his suite, with their \nCossacks who were talking loudly together, \nPrince Andrew entered the passage. Kutuzov \nhimself, he was told, was in the house with \nPrince Bagrati6n and Weyrother. Weyrother \nwas the Austrian general who had succeeded \nSchmidt. In the passage little Kozl6vski was \nsquatting on his heels in front of a clerk. The \nclerk, with cuffs turned up, was hastily writing \nat a tub turned bottom upwards. Kozlovski's \nface looked worn he too had evidently not \nslept all night. He glanced at Prince Andrew \nand did not even nod to him. \n\n"Second line . . . have you written it?" he con- \ntinued dictating to the clerk. "The Kiev Gren- \nadiers, Podolian . . ." \n\n"One can't write so fast, your honor," said \nthe clerk, glancing angrily and disrespectfully \nat Kozlovski. \n\nThrough the door came the sounds of Kutu- \nzov's voice, excited and dissatisfied, interrupted \nby another, an unfamiliar voice. From the \nsound of these voices, the inattentive way Koz- \n16vski looked at him, the disrespectful manner \nof the exhausted clerk, the fact that the clerk \nand Kozl6vski were squatting on the floor by a \ntub so near to the commander in chief, and \nfrom the noisy laughter of the Cossacks holding \nthe horses near the window, Prince Andrew \nfelt that something important and disastrous \nwas about to happen. \n\nHe turned to Kozl6vski with urgent ques- \ntions. \n\n"Immediately, Prince," said Kozl6vski. "Dis- \npositions for Bagrati6n." \n\n"What about capitulation?" \n\n"Nothing of the sort. Orders are issued for a \nbattle." \n\nPrince Andrew moved toward the door from \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nwhence voices were heard. Just as he was going \nto open it the sounds ceased, the door opened, \nand Kutuzov with his eagle nose and puffy \nface appeared in the doorway. Prince Andrew \nstood right in front of Kutiizov but the expres- \nsion of the commander in chief's one sound eye \nshowed him to be so preoccupied with thoughts \nand anxieties as to be oblivious of his presence. \nHe looked straight at his adjutant's face with- \nout recognizing him. \n\n"Well, have you finished?" said he to Kozl6v- \nski. \n\n"One moment, your excellency." \n\nBagrati6n, a gaunt middle-aged man of me- \ndium height with a firm, impassive face of Ori- \nental type, came out after the commander in \nchief. \n\n"I have the honor to present myself," repeat- \ned Prince Andrew rather loudly, handing Kut- \niizov an envelope. \n\n"Ah, from Vienna? Very good. Later, later 1" \n\nKutiizov went out into the porch with Ba- \ngrati6n. \n\n"Well, good-by, Prince," said he to Bagration. \n"My blessing, and may Christ be with you in \nyour great endeavorl" \n\nHis face suddenly softened and tears came in- \nto his eyes. With his left hand he drew Bagra- \nti6n toward him, and with his right, on which \nhe wore a ring, he made the sign of the cross \nover him with a gesture evidently habitual, of- \nfering his puffy cheek, but Bagrati6n kissed \nhim on the neck instead. \n\n"Christ be with you!" Kutuzov repeated and \nwent toward his carriage. "Get in with me," \nsaid he to Bolk6nski. \n\n"Your excellency, I should like to be of use \nhere. Allow me to remain with Prince Bagra- \nti6n's detachment." \n\n"Get in," said Kutuzov, and noticing that \nBolk6nski still delayed, he added: "I need good \nofficers myself, need them myself 1" \n\nThey got into the carriage and drove for a \nfew minutes in silence. \n\n"There is still much, much before us," he \nsaid, as if with an old man's penetration he un- \nderstood all that was passing in Bolk6nski's \nmind. "If a tenth part of his detachment re- \nturns I shall thank God," he added as if speak- \ning to himself. \n\nPrince Andrew glanced at Kutiizov's face on- \nly a foot distant from him and involuntarily \nnoticed the carefully washed seams of the scar \nnear his temple, where an Ismail bullet had \npierced his skull, and the empty eye socket. \n"Yes, he has a right to speak so calmly of those \n\n\n\nmen's death," thought Bolk6nski. \n\n"That is why I beg to be sent to that detach- \nment," he said. \n\nKutuzov did not reply. He seemed to have \nforgotten what he had been saying, and sat \nplunged in thought. Five minutes later, gently \nswaying on the soft springs of the carriage, he \nturned to Prince Andrew. There was not a trace \nof agitation on his face. With delicate irony he \nquestioned Prince Andrew about the details \nof his interview with the Emperor, about the \nremarks he had heard at court concerning the \nKrems affair, and about some ladies they both \nknew. \n\nCHAPTER XIV \n\nON NOVEMBER i Kutuzov had received, through \na spy, news that the army he commanded was \nin an almost hopeless position. The spy reported \nthat the French, after crossing the bridge at \nVienna, were advancing in immense force up- \non Kutiizov's line of communication with the \ntroops that were arriving from Russia. If Ku- \ntuzov decided to remain at Krems, Napoleon's \narmy of one hundred and fifty thousand men \nwould cut him off completely and surround his \nexhausted army of forty thousand, and he \nwould find himself in the position of Mack at \nUlm. If Kutuzov decided to abandon the road \nconnecting him with the troops arriving from \nRussia, he would have to march with no road \ninto unknown parts of the Bohemian moun- \ntains, defending himself against superior forces \nof the enemy and abandoning all hope of a \njunction with Buxhowden. If Kutiizov decid- \ned to retreat along the road from Krems to \nOlmiitz, to unite with the troops arriving \nfrom Russia, he risked being forestalled on \nthat road by the French who had crossed \nthe Vienna bridge, and encumbered by his \nbaggage and transport, having to accept bat- \ntle on the march against an enemy three times \nas strong, who would hem him in from two \nsides. \n\nKutiizov chose this latter course. \n\nThe French, the spy reported, having crossed \nthe Vienna bridge, were advancing by forced \nmarches toward Znaim, which lay sixty-six \nmiles off on the line of Kutiizov's retreat. If he \nreached Znaim before the French, there would \nbe great hope of saving the army; to let the \nFrench forestall him at Znaim meant the ex- \nposure of his whole army to a disgrace such as \nthat of Ulm, or to utter destruction. But to \nforestall the French with his whole army was \nimpossible. The road for the French from Vi- \n\n\n\nBOOK TWO \n\n\n\n93 \n\n\n\nenna to Znaim was shorter and better than the \nroad for the Russians from Krems to Znaim. \n\nThe night he received the news, Kutiizov \nsent Bagrati6n's vanguard, four thousand \nstrong, to the right across the hills from the \nKrems-Znaim to the Vienna-Znaim road. Ba- \ngrati6n was to make this march without rest- \ning, and to halt facing Vienna with Znaim to \nhis rear, and if he succeeded in forestalling the \nFrench he was to delay them as long as possible. \nKutiizov himself with all his transport took the \nroad to Znaim. \n\nMarching thirty miles that stormy night \nacross roadless hills, with his hungry, ill-shod \nsoldiers, and losing a third of his men as strag- \nglers by the way, Bagration came out on the \nVienna-Znaim road at Hollabriinn a few hours \nahead of the French who were approaching \nHollabriinn from Vienna. Kutiizov with his \ntransport had still to march for some days be- \nfore he could reach Znaim. Hence Bagrati6n \nwith his four thousand hungry, exhausted men \nwould have to detain for days the whole enemy \narmy that came upon him at Hollabriinn, \nwhich was clearly impossible. But a freak of \nfate made the impossible possible. The success \nof the trick that had placed the Vienna bridge \nin the hands of the French without a fight led \nMurat to try to deceive Kutiizov in a similar \nway. Meeting Bagration's weak detachment on \nthe Znaim road he supposed it to be Kutiizov's \nwhole army. To be able to crush it absolutely \nhe awaited the arrival of the rest of the troops \nwho were on their way from Vienna, and with \nthis object offered a three days' truce on condi- \ntion that botharmiesshould remain in position \nwithout moving. Murat declared that negoti- \nations for peace were already proceeding, and \nthat he therefore offered this truce to avoid un- \nnecessary bloodshed. Count Nostitz, the Aus- \ntrian general occupying the advanced posts, be- \nlieved Murat's emissary and retired, leaving \nBagrati6n's division exposed. Another emis- \nsary rode to the Russian line to announce the \npeace negotiations and to offer the Russian ar- \nmy the three days' truce. Bagration replied that \nhe was not authorized either to accept or re- \nfuse a truce and sent his adjutant to Kutiizov to \nreport the offer he had received. \n\nA truce was Kutiizov's sole chance of gain- \ning time, giving Bagrati6n's exhausted troops \nsome rest, and letting the transport and heavy \nconvoys (whose movements were concealed \nfrom the French) advance if but one stage \nnearer Znaim. The offer of a truce gave the on- \nly, and a quite unexpected, chance of saving \n\n\n\nthe army. On receiving the news he immediate- \nly dispatched Adjutant General Wintzinger- \node, who was in attendance on him, to the en- \nemy camp. Wintzingerode was not merely to \nagree to the truce but also to offer terms of ca- \npitulation, and meanwhile Kutiizov sent his ad- \njutants back to hasten to the utmost the move- \nments of the baggage trains of the entire army \nalong the Krems-Znaim road. Bagrati6n's ex- \nhausted and hungry detachment, which alone \ncovered this movement of the transport and \nof the whole army, had to remain stationary \nin face of an enemy eight times as strong as it- \nself. \n\nKutiizov's expectations that the proposals of \ncapitulation (which were in no way binding) \nmight give time for part of the transport to \npass, and also that Murat's mistake would very \nsoon be discovered, proved correct. As soon as \nBonaparte (who was at Schonbrunn, sixteen \nmiles from Hollabriinn) received Murat's dis- \npatch with the proposal of a truce and a capit- \nulation, he detected a ruse and wrote the fol- \nlowing letter to Murat: \n\nSchonbrunn, 25th Brumaire, 1805, \nat eight o'clock in the morning \nTo PRINCE MURAT, \n\nI cannot find words to express to you my dis- \npleasure. You command only my advance guard, \nand have no right to arrange an armistice without \nmy order. You are causing me to lose the fruits \nof a campaign. Break the armistice immediately \nand march on the enemy. Inform him that the \ngeneral who signed that capitulation had no right \nto do so, and that no one but the Emperor of \nRussia has that right. \n\nIf, however, the Emperor of Russia ratifies that \nconvention, I will ratify it; but it is only a trick. \nMarch on, destroy the Russian army. . . . You are \nin a position to seize its baggage and artillery. \n\nThe Russian Emperor's aide-de-camp is an im- \npostor. Officers are nothing when they have no \npowers; this one had none. . . . The Austrians let \nthemselves be tricked at the crossing of the Vienna \nbridge, you are letting yourself be tricked by an \naide-de-camp of the Emperor. \n\nNAPOLEON \n\nBonaparte's adjutant rode full gallop with \nthis menacing letter to Murat. Bonaparte him- \nself, not trusting to his generals, moved with \nall the Guards to the field of battle, afraid of \nletting a ready victim escape, and Bagrati6n's \nfour thousand men merrily lighted campfires, \ndried and warmed themselves, cooked their \nporridge for the first time for three days, and \nnot one of them knew or imagined what was in \nstore for him. \n\n\n\n94 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV \n\nBETWEEN three and four o'clock in the after- \nnoon Prince Andrew, who had persisted in his \nrequest to Kutuzov, arrived at Grunth and re- \nported himself to Bagrati6n. Bonaparte's ad- \njutant had not yet reached Murat's detach- \nment and the battle had not yet begun. In Ba- \ngrati6n's detachment no one knew anything of \nthe general position of affairs. They talked of \npeace but did not believe in its possibility; oth- \ners talked of a battle but also disbelieved in the \nnearness of an engagement. Bagrati6n, know- \ning Bolk6nski to be a favorite and trusted ad- \njutant, received him with distinction and spe- \ncial marks of favor, explaining to him that \nthere would probably be an engagement that \nday or the next, and giving him full liberty to \nremain with him during the battle or to join \nthe rearguard and have an eye on the order \nof retreat, "which is also very important." \n\n"However, there will hardly be an engage- \nment today," said Bagrati6n as if to reassure \nPrince Andrew. \n\n"If he is one of the ordinary little staff dan- \ndies sent to earn a medal he can get his reward \njust as well in the rearguard, but if he wishes \nto stay with me, let him . . . he'll be of use \nhere if he's a brave officer," thought Bagrati6n. \nPrince Andrew, without replying, asked the \nprince's permission to ride round the position \nto see the disposition of the forces, so as to \nknow his bearings should he be sent to execute \nan order. The officer on duty, a handsome, ele- \ngantly dressed man with a diamond ring on his \nforefinger, who was fond of speaking French \nthough he spoke it badly, offered to conduct \nPrince Andrew. \n\nOn all sides they saw rain-soaked officers with \ndejected faces who seemed to be seeking some- \nthing, and soldiers dragging doors, benches, \nand fencing from the village. \n\n"There now, Prince! We can't stop those fel- \nlows/' said the staff officer pointing to the sol- \ndiers. "The officers don't keep them in hand. \nAnd there," he pointed to a sutler's tent, "they \ncrowd in and sit. This morning I turned them \nall out and now look, it's full again. I must go \nthere, Prince, and scare them a bit. It won't \ntake a moment." \n\n"Yes, let's go in and I will get myself a roll \nand some cheese," said Prince Andrew who \nhad not yet had time to eat anything. \n\n"Why didn't you mention it, Prince? I would \nhave offered you something." \n\nThey dismounted and entered the tent. Sev- \neral officers, with flushed and weary faces, were \n\n\n\nsitting at the table eating and drinking. \n\n"Now what does this mean, gentlemen?" said \nthe staff officer, in the reproachful tone of a \nman who has repeated the same thing more \nthan once. "You know it won't do to leave your \nposts like this. The prince gave orders that no \none should leave his post. Now you, Captain," \nand he turned to a thin, dirty little artillery of- \nficer who without his boots (he had given them \nto the canteen keeper to dry), in only his stock- \nings, rose when they entered, smiling not alto- \ngether comfortably. \n\n"Well, aren't you ashamed of yourself, Cap- \ntain Tusliin?" he continued. "One would think \nthat as an artillery officer you would set a good \nexample, yet here you are without your boots! \nThe alarm will be sounded and you'll be in a \npretty position without your boots!" (The staff \nofficer smiled.) "Kindly return to your posts, \ngentlemen, all of you, all!" he added in a tone \nof command. \n\nPrince Andrew smiled involuntarily as he \nlooked at the artillery officer Tushin, who si- \nlent and smiling, shifting from one stockinged \nfoot to the other, glanced inquiringly with his \nlarge, intelligent, kindly eyes from Prince An- \ndrew to the staff officer. \n\n"The soldiers say it feels easier without \nboots," said Captain Tushin smiling shyly in \nhis uncomfortable position, evidently wishing \nto adopt a jocular tone. But before he had fin- \nished he felt that his jest was unacceptable and \nhad not come off. He grew confused. \n\n"Kindly return to your posts," said the staff \nofficer trying to preserve his gravity. \n\nPrince Andrew glanced again at the artillery \nofficer's small figure. There was something pe- \nculiar about it, quite unsoldierly, rather comic, \nbut extremely attractive. \n\nThe staff officer and Prince Andrew mounted \ntheir horses and rode on. \n\nHaving ridden beyond the village, contin- \nually meeting and overtaking soldiers and of- \nficers of various regiments, they saw on their \nleft some entrenchments being thrown up, the \nfreshly dug clay of which showed up red. Sev- \neral battalions of soldiers, in their shirt sleeves \ndespite the cold wind, swarmed in these earth- \nworks like a host of white ants; spadefuls of red \nclay were continually being thrown up from \nbehind the bank by unseen hands. Prince An- \ndrew and the officer rode up, looked at the en- \ntrenchment, and went on again. Just behind it \nthey came upon some dozens of soldiers, con- \ntinually replaced by others, who ran from the \nentrenchment. They had to hold their noses \n\n\n\nBOOK TWO \n\n\n\n95 \n\n\n\nand put their horses to a trot to escape from \nthe poisoned atmosphere of these latrines. \n\n"Voild I'agrdment des camps, monsieur le \nprince" * said the staff officer. \n\nThey rode up the opposite hill. From there \nthe French could already be seen. Prince An- \ndrew stopped and began examining the posi- \ntion. \n\n"That's our battery," said the staff officer in- \ndicating the highest point. "It's in charge of \nthe queer fellow we saw without his boots. You \ncan see everything from there; let's go there, \nPrince." \n\n"Thank you very much, I will go on alone," \nsaid Prince Andrew, wishing to rid himself of \nthis staff officer's company, "please don't trou- \nble yourself further." \n\nThe staff officer remained behind and Prince \nAndrew rode on alone. \n\nThe farther forward and nearer the enemy \nhe went, the more orderly and cheerful were \nthe troops. The greatest disorder and depres- \nsion had been in the baggage train he had passed \nthat morning on the Znaim road seven miles \naway from the French. At Grunth also some ap- \nprehension and alarm could be felt, but the \nnearer Prince Andrew came to the French lines \nthe more confident was the appearance of our \ntroops. The soldiers in their greatcoats were \nranged in lines, the sergeants major and com- \npany officers were counting themen, poking the \nlast man in each section in the ribs and telling \nhim to hold his hand up. Soldiers scattered \nover the whole place were dragging logs and \nbrushwood and were building shelters with \nmerry chatter and laughter; around the fires \nsat others, dressed and undressed, drying their \nshirts and leg bands or mending boots or over- \ncoats and crowding round the boilers and por- \nridge cookers. In one company dinner was \nready, and the soldiers were gazing eagerly at \nthe steaming boiler, waiting till the sample, \nwhich a quartermaster sergeant was carrying in \na wooden bowl to an officer who sat on a log be- \nfore his shelter, had been tasted. \n\nAnother company, a lucky one for not all the \ncompanies had vodka, crowded round a pock- \nmarked, broad-shouldered sergeant majorwho, \ntilting a keg, filled one after another the can- \nteen lids held out to him. The soldiers lifted \nthe canteen lids to their lips with reverential \nfaces, emptied them, rolling the vodka in their \nmouths, and walked away from the sergeant \nmajor with brightened expressions, licking \ntheir lips and wiping them on the sleeves of \n\n1 "This is a pleasure one gets in camp, Prince." \n\n\n\ntheir greatcoats. All their faces were as serene \nas if all this were happening at home awaiting \npeaceful encampment, and not within sight of \nthe enemy before an action in which at least \nhalf of them would be left on the field. After \npassing a chasseur regiment and in the lines of \nthe Kiev grenadiers fine fellows busy withsim- \nilar peaceful affairs near the shelter of the reg- \nimental commander, higher than and different \nfrom the others, Prince Andrew came out in \nfront of a platoon of grenadiers before whom \nlay a naked man. Two soldiers held him while \ntwo others were flourishing their switches and \nstriking him regularly on his bare back. The \nman shrieked unnaturally. A stout major was \npacing up and down the line, and regardless of \nthe screams kept repeating: \n\n"It's a shame for a soldier to steal; a soldier \nmust be honest, honorable, and brave, but if \nhe robs his fellows there is no honor in him, \nhe's a scoundrel. Go on! Go on!" \n\nSo the swishing sound of the strokes, and the \ndesperate but unnatural screams, continued. \n\n"Go on, go on!" said the major. \n\nA young officer with a bewildered and pained \nexpression on his face stepped away from the \nman and looked round inquiringly at the ad- \njutant as he rode by. \n\nPrince Andrew, having reached the front \nline, rode along it. Our front line and that of \nthe enemy were far apart on the right and left \nflanks, but in the center where the men with a \nflag of truce had passed that morning, the lines \nwere so near together that the men could see \none another's faces and speak to one another. \nBesides the soldiers who formed the picket line \non either side, there were many curious onlook- \ners who, jesting and laughing, stared at their \nstrange foreign enemies. \n\nSince early morning despite an injunction \nnot to approach the picket line the officers \nhad been unable to keep sight-seers away. The \nsoldiers forming the picket line, like showmen \nexhibiting a curiosity, no longer looked at the \nFrench but paid attention to the sight-seers and \ngrew weary waiting to be relieved. Prince An- \ndrew halted to have a look at the French. \n\n"Look! Look there 1" one soldier was saying \nto another, pointing to a Russian musketeer \nwho had gone up to the picket line with an of- \nficer and was rapidly and excitedly talking to a \nFrench grenadier. "Hark to him jabbering! \nFine, isn't it? It's all the Frenchycan do to keep \nup with him. There now, Sfdorov!" \n\n"Wait a bit and listen. It's fine!" answered \nSfdorov, who was considered an adept at French. \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nThe soldier to whom the laughers referred \nwas Dolokhov. Prince Andrew recognized him \nand stopped to listen to what he was saying. \nD61okhov had come from the left flank where \ntheir regiment was stationed, with his captain. \n\n"Now then, go on, go on!" incited the officer, \nbending forward and trying not to lose a word \nof the speech which was incomprehensible to \nhim. "More, please: more! What's he saying? \n\nD61okhov did not answer the captain; he \nhad been drawn into a hot dispute with the \nFrench grenadier. They were naturally talking \nabout the campaign. The Frenchman, confus- \ning the Austrians with the Russians, was trying \nto prove that the Russians had surrendered and \nhad fled all the way from Ulm, while D61okhov \nmaintained that the Russians had not surren- \ndered but had beaten the French. \n\n"We have orders to drive you off here, and \nwe shall drive you off," said D61okhov. \n\n"Only take care you and your Cossacks are \nnot all captured!" said the French grenadier. \n\nThe French onlookers and listeners laughed. \n\n"We'll make you dance as we did under Su- \nv6rov . . . ," * said D61okhov. \n\n"Qu' est-ce qu'H chante?" * asked a French- \nman. \n\n"It's ancient history," said another, guess- \ning that it referred to a former war. "The Em- \nperor will teach your Suvara as he has taught \nthe others ..." \n\n"Bonaparte ..." began D61okhov, but the \nFrenchman interrupted him. \n\n"Not Bonaparte. He is the Emperor! Sacrd \nnom . , . /" cried he angrily. \n\n"The devil skin your Emperor." \n\nAnd D61okhov swore at him in coarse sol- \ndier's Russian and shouldering his musket \nwalked away. \n\n"Let us go, Ivan Lukich," he said to the cap- \ntain. \n\n"Ah, that's the way to talk French," said the \npicket soldiers. "Now, Sfdorov,you have a try!" \n\nSfdorov, turning to the French, winked, and \nbegan to jabber meaningless sounds very fast: \n"Kari, mala, tafa, safi, muter, Kasha," he said, \ntrying to give an expressive intonation to his \nvoice. \n\n"Ho! ho! ho! Ha! ha! ha! ha! Ouh! ouh!" \ncame peals of such healthy and good-humored \nlaughter from the soldiers that it infected the \nFrench involuntarily, so much so that the only \nthing left to do seemed to be to unload the mus- \nkets, explode the ammunition, and all return \n\n1 "On vous fera danser" \n\n* "What's he singing about?" \n\n\n\nhome as quickly as possible. \n\nBut the guns remained loaded, the loopholes \nin blockhouses and entrenchments looked out \njust as menacingly, and the unlimbered can- \nnon confronted one another as before. \n\nCHAPTER XVI \n\nHAVING RIDDEN round the whole line from right \nflank to left, Prince Andrew made his way up \nto the battery from which the staff officer had \ntold him the whole field could be seen. Here \nhe dismounted, and stopped beside the farthest \nof the four unlimbered cannon. Before theguns \nan artillery sentry was pacing up and down; he \nstood at attention when the officer arrived, but \nat a sign resumed his measured, monotonous \npacing. Behind the guns were their limbers \nand still farther back picket ropes and artillery- \nmen's bonfires. To the left, not far from the \nfarthest cannon, was a small, newly constructed \nwattle shed from which came the sound of of- \nficers' voices in eager conversation. \n\nIt was true that a view over nearly the whole \nRussian position and the greater part of the \nenemy's opened out from this battery. Just fac- \ning it, on the crest of the opposite hill, the vil- \nlage of Schon Grabern could be seen, and in \nthree places to left and right the French troops \namid the smoke of their campfires, the greater \npart of whom were evidently in the village it- \nself and behind the hill. To the left from that \nvillage, amid the smoke, was something resem- \nbling a battery, but it was impossible to see it \nclearly with the naked eye. Our right flank was \nposted on a rather steep incline which domi- \nnated the French position. Our infantry were \nstationed there, and at the farthest point the \ndragoons. In the center, where Tiishin's bat- \ntery stood and from which Prince Andrew was \nsurveying the position, was the easiest and most \ndirect descent and ascent to the brook separat- \ning us from Schon Grabern. On the left our \ntroops were close to a copse, in which smoked \nthe bonfires of our infantry who were felling \nwood. The French line was wider than ours, \nand it was plain that they could easily outflank \nus on both sides. Behind our position was a \nsteep and deep dip, making it difficult for ar- \ntillery and cavalry to retire. Prince Andrew \ntook out his notebook and, leaning on the can- \nnon, sketched a plan of the position. He made \nsome notes on two points, intending to men- \ntion them to Bagrati6n. His idea was, first, to \nconcentrate all the artillery in the center, and \nsecondly, to withdraw the cavalry to the other \nside of the dip. Prince Andrew, being always \n\n\n\nBOOK TWO \n\n\n\n97 \n\n\n\nnear the commander in chief, closely follow- \ning the mass movements and general orders, \nand constantly studying historical accounts of \nbattles, involuntarily pictured to himself the \ncourse of events in the forthcoming action in \nbroad outline. He imagined only important \npossibilities: "If the enemy attacks the right \nflank," he said to himself, "the Kiev grenadiers \nand the Pod61sk chasseurs must hold their po- \nsition till reserves from the center come up. In \nthat case the dragoons could successfully make \na flank counterattack. If they attack our center \nwe, having the center battery on this high \nground, shall withdraw the left flank under its \ncover, and retreat to the dip by echelons." So \nhe reasoned. ... All the time he had been be- \nside the gun, he had heard the voices of the offi- \ncers distinctly, but as often happens had not \nunderstood a word of what they were saying. \nSuddenly, however, he was struck by a voice \ncoming from the shed, and its tone was so sin- \ncere that he could not but listen. \n\n"No, friend," said a pleasant and, as it \nseemed to Prince Andrew, a familiar voice, \n"what I say is that if it were possible to know \nwhat is beyond death, none of us would be \nafraid of it. That's so, friend." \n\nAnother, a younger voice, interrupted him: \n"Afraid or not, you can't escape it anyhow." \n\n"All the same, one is afraid! Oh, you clever \npeople," said a third manly voice interrupt- \ning them both. "Of course you artillery men \nare very wise, because you can take everything \nalong with you vodka and snacks." \n\nAnd the owner of the manly voice, evidently \nan infantry officer, laughed. \n\n"Yes, one is afraid," continued the first speak- \ner, he of the familiar voice. "One is afraid of \nthe unknown, that's what it is. Whatever we \nmay say about the soul going to the sky ... we \nknow there is no sky but only an atmosphere." \n\nThe manly voice again interrupted the ar- \ntillery officer. \n\n"Well, stand us some of your herb vodka, \nTushin," it said. \n\n"Why," thought Prince Andrew, "that's the \ncaptain who stood up in the sutler's hut with- \nout his boots." He recognized the agreeable, \nphilosophizing voice with pleasure. \n\n"Some herb vodka? Certainly 1" said Tiishin. \n"But still, to conceive a future life . . ." \n\nHe did not finish. Just then there was a whis- \ntle in the air; nearer and nearer, faster and \nlouder, louder and faster, a cannon ball, as if \nit had not finished saying what was necessary, \nthudded into the ground near the shed with \n\n\n\nsuperhuman force, throwing up a mass of earth. \nThe ground seemed to groan at the terrible im- \npact. \n\nAnd immediately Tiishin, with a short pipe \nin the corner of his mouth and his kind, intel- \nligent face rather pale, rushed out of the shed \nfollowed by the owner of the manly voice, a \ndashing infantry officer who hurried off to his \ncompany, buttoning up his coat as he ran. \n\nCHAPTER XVII \n\nMOUNTING HIS HORSE again Prince Andrew lin- \ngered with the battery, looking at the puff from \nthe gun that had sent the ball. His eyes ran \nrapidly over the wide space, but he only saw \nthat the hitherto motionless masses of the \nFrench now swayed and that there really was a \nbattery to their left. The smoke above it had \nnot yet dispersed. Two mounted Frenchmen, \nprobably adjutants, were galloping up the hill. \nA small but distinctly visible enemy column \nwas moving down the hill, probably to strength- \nen the front line. The smoke of the first shot \nhad not yet dispersed before another puff ap- \npeared, followed by a report. The battle had \nbegun 1 Prince Andrew turned his horse and \ngalloped back to Grunth to find Prince Bagra- \ntion. He heard the cannonade behind him \ngrowing louder and more frequent. Evidently \nour guns had begun to reply. From the bottom \nof the slope, where the parleys had taken place, \ncame the report of musketry. \n\nLemarrois had just arrived at a gallop with \nBonaparte's stern letter, and Murat, humili- \nated and anxious to expiate his fault, had at \nonce moved his forces to attack the center and \noutflank both the Russian wings, hoping be- \nfore evening and before the arrival of the Em- \nperor to crush the contemptible detachment \nthat stood before him. \n\n"It has begun. Here it is!" thought Prince \nAndrew, feeling the blood rush to his heart. \n"But where and how will my Toulon present \nitself?" \n\nPassing between the companies that had been \neating porridge and drinking vodka a quarter \nof an hour before, he saw everywhere the same \nrapid movement of soldiers forming ranks and \ngetting their muskets ready, and on all their \nfaces he recognized the same eagerness that \nfilled his heart. "It has begun! Here it is, dread- \nful but enjoyable!" was what the face of each \nsoldier and each officer seemed to say. \n\nBefore he had reached the embankments that \nwere being thrown up, he saw, in the light of \nthe dull autumn evening, mounted men com- \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\ning toward him. The foremost, wearing a Cos- \nsack cloak and lambskin cap and riding a \nwhite horse, was Prince Bagrati6n. Prince An- \ndrew stopped, waiting for him to come up; \nPrince Bagrati6n reined in his horse and recog- \nnizing Prince Andrew nodded to him. He still \nlooked ahead while Prince Andrew told him \nwhat he had seen. \n\nThe feeling, "It has begun! Here it is!" was \nseen even on Prince Bagrati6n's hard brown \nface with its half-closed, dull, sleepy eyes. Prince \nAndrew gazed with anxious curiosity at that \nimpassive face and wished he could tell what, \nif anything, this man was thinking and feeling \nat that moment. "Is there anything at all be- \nhind that impassive face?" Prince Andrew asked \nhimself as he looked. Prince Bagrati6n bent \nhis head in sign of agreement with what Prince \nAndrew told him, and said, "Very good!" in a \ntone that seemed to imply that everything that \ntook place and was reported to him was exact- \nly what he had foreseen. Prince Andrew, out of \nbreath with his rapid ride, spoke quickly. Prince \nBagrati6n, uttering his words with an Oriental \naccent, spoke particularly slowly, as if to im- \npress the fact that there was no need to hurry. \nHowever, he put his horse to a trot in the di- \nrection of Ttishin's battery. Prince Andrew fol- \nlowed with the suite. Behind Prince Bagrati6n \nrode an officer of the suite, the prince's per- \nsonal adjutant, Zherkriv, an orderly officer, the \nstaff officer on duty, riding a fine bobtailed \nhorse, and a civilian an accountant who had \nasked permission to be present at the battle \nout of curiosity. The accountant, a stout, full- \nfaced man, looked around him with a nai've \nsmile of satisfaction and presented a strange \nappearance among the hussars, Cossacks, and \nadjutants, in his camlet coat, as he jolted on his \nhorse with a convoy officer's saddle. \n\n"He wants to see a battle," said Zherk6v to \nBolk6nski, pointing to the accountant, "but \nhe feels a pain in the pit of his stomach al- \nready." \n\n"Oh, leave off!" said the accountant with a \nbeaming but rather cunning smile, as if flat- \ntered at being made the subject of Zherk6v's \njoke, and purposely trying to appear stupider \nthan he really was. \n\n"It is very strange, mon Monsieur Prince" \nsaid the staff officer. (He remembered that in \nFrench there is some peculiar way of address- \ning a prince, but could not get it quite right.) \n\nBy this time they were all approaching Tu- \nshin's battery, and a ball struck the ground in \nfront of them. \n\n\n\n"What's that that has fallen?" asked the ac- \ncountant with a naive smile. \n\n"A French pancake," answered Zherk6v. \n\n"So that's what they hit with?" asked the ac- \ncountant. "How awful!" \n\nHe seemed to swell with satisfaction. He had \nhardly finished speaking when they again heard \nan unexpectedly violent whistling which sud- \ndenly ended with a thud into something soft \n. . . f-f-flop! and a Cossack, riding a little to \ntheir right and behind the accountant, crashed \nto earth with his horse. Zherkov and the staff \nofficer bent over their saddles and turned their \nhorses away. The accountant stopped, facing \nthe Cossack, and examined him with attentive \ncuriosity. The Cossack was dead, but the horse \nstill struggled. \n\nPrince Bagrati6n screwed up his eyes, looked \nround, and, seeing the cause of the confusion, \nturned away with indifference, as if to say, "Is \nit worth while noticing trifles?" He reined in \nhis horse with the ease of a skillful rider and, \nslightly bending over, disengaged his saber \nwhich had caught in his cloak. It was an old- \nfashioned saber of a kind no longer in general \nuse. Prince Andrew remembered the story of \nSuvorov giving his saber to Bagrati6n in Italy, \nand the recollection was particularly pleasant \nat that moment. They had reached the battery \nat which Prince Andrew had been when he ex- \namined the battlefield. \n\n"Whose company?" asked Prince Bagrati6n \nof an artilleryman standing by the ammuni- \ntion wagon. \n\nHe asked, "Whose company?" but he really \nmeant, "Are you frightened here?" and the \nartilleryman understood him. \n\n"Captain Tushin's, your excellency!" shout- \ned the red-haired, freckled gunner in a merry \nvoice, standing to attention. \n\n"Yes, yes," muttered Bagrati6n as if consid- \nering something, and he rode past the limbers \nto the farthest cannon. \n\nAs he approached, a ringing shot issued from \nit deafening him and his suite, and in the smoke \nthat suddenly surrounded the gun they could \nsee the gunners who had seized it straining to \nroll it quickly back to its former position. A \nhuge, broad-shouldered gunner, Number One, \nholding a mop, his legs far apart, sprang to the \nwheel; while Number Two with a trembling \nhand placed a charge in the cannon's mouth. \nThe short, round-shouldered Captain Tiishin, \nstumbling over the tail of the gun carriage, \nmoved forward and, not noticing the general, \nlooked out shading his eyes with his small hand. \n\n\n\nBOOK TWO \n\n\n\n99 \n\n\n\n"Lift it two lines more and it will be just \nright," cried he in a feeble voice to which he \ntried to impart a dashing note, ill suited to his \nweak figure. "Number Two!" he squeaked. \n"Fire, Medve*devl" \n\nBagrati6n called to him, and Tushin, raising \nthree fingers to his cap with a bashful and awk- \nward gesture not at all like a military salute \nbut like a priest's benediction, approached the \ngeneral. Though Tushin's guns had been in- \ntended to cannonade the valley, he was firing \nincendiary balls at the village of Schon Gra- \nbern visible just opposite, in front of which \nlarge masses of French were advancing. \n\nNo one had given, Tushin orders where and \nat what to fire, but after consulting his ser- \ngeant major, Zakharchenko, for whom he had \ngreat respect, he had decided that it would be \na good thing to set fire to the village. "Very \ngood I" said Bagrati6n in reply to the officer's \nreport, and began deliberately to examine the \nwhole battlefield extended before him. The \nFrench had advanced nearest on our right. Be- \nlow the height on which the Kiev regiment was \nstationed, in the hollow where the rivulet \nflowed, the soul-stirring rolling and crackling \nof musketry was heard, and much farther to \nthe right beyond the dragoons, the officer of \nthe suite pointed out to Bagration a French \ncolumn that was outflanking us. To the left \nthe horizon was bounded by the adjacent wood. \nPrince Bagrad6n ordered two battalions from \nthe center to be sent to reinforce the right \nflank. The officer of the suite ventured to re- \nmark to the prince that if these battalions went \naway, the guns would remain without support. \nPrince Bagrati6n turned to the officer and with \nhis dull eyes looked at him in silence. It seemed \nto Prince Andrew that the officer's remark was \njust and that really no answer could be made \nto it. But at that moment an adjutant galloped \nup with a message from the commander of the \nregiment in the hollow and news that immense \nmasses of the French were coming down upon \nthem and that his regiment was in disorder \nand was retreating upon the Kiev grenadiers. \nPrince Bagration bowed his head in sign of as- \nsent and approval. He rode off at a walk to the \nright and sent an adjutant to the dragoons \nwith orders to attack the French. But this ad- \njutant returned half an hour later with the \nnews that the commander of the dragoons had \nalready retreated beyond the dip in the ground, \nas a heavy fire had been opened on him and he \nwas losing men uselessly, and so had hastened \nto throw some sharpshooters into the wood. \n\n\n\n"Very good!" said Bagrati6n. \n\nAs he was leaving the battery, firing was heard \non the left also, and as it was too far to the left \nflank for him to have time to go there himself, \nPrince Bagrati6n sent Zherk6v to tell the gen- \neral in command (the one who had paraded \nhis regiment before Kutuzov at Braunau) that \nhe must retreat as quickly as possible behind \nthe hollow in the rear, as the right flank would \nprobably not be able to withstand the enemy's \nattack very long. About Tushin and the bat- \ntalion that had been in support of his battery \nall was forgotten. Prince Andrew listened at- \ntentively to Bagrati6n's colloquies with the \ncommanding officers and the orders he gave \nthem and, to his surprise, found that no orders \nwere really given, but that Prince Bagrati6n \ntried to make it appear that everything done \nby necessity, by accident, or by the will of sub- \nordinate commanders was done, if not by his \ndirect command, at least in accord with his in- \ntentions. Prince Andrew noticed, however, that \nthough what happened was due to chance and \nwas independent of the commander's will, ow- \ning to the tact Bagrati6n showed, his presence \nwas very valuable. Officers who approached him \nwith disturbed countenances became calm; sol- \ndiers and officers greeted him gaily, grew more \ncheerful in his presence, and were evidently \nanxious to display their courage before him. \n\nCHAPTER XVIII \n\nPRINCE BAGRATION, having reached the high- \nest point of our right flank, began riding down- \nhill to where the roll of musketry was heard \nbut where on account of the smoke nothing \ncould be seen. The nearer they got to the hol- \nlow the less they could see but the more they \nfelt the nearness of the actual battlefield. They \nbegan to meet wounded men. One with a \nbleeding head and no cap was being dragged \nalong by two soldiers who supported him un- \nder the arms. There was a gurgle in his throat \nand he was spitting blood. A bullet had evi- \ndently hit him in the throat or mouth. Another \nwas walking sturdily by himself but without \nhis musket, groaning aloud and swinging his \nann which had just been hurt, while blood \nfrom it was streaming over his greatcoat as \nfrom a bottle. He had that moment been \nwounded and his face showed fear rather than \nsuffering. Crossing a road they descended a \nsteep incline and saw several men lying on the \nground; they also met a crowd of soldiers some \nof whom were unwounded. The soldiers were \nascending the hill breathing heavily, and de- \n\n\n\n1OO \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nspite the general's presence were talking loud- \nly and gesticulating. In front of them rows of \ngray cloaks were already visible through the \nsmoke, and an officer catching sight of Bagra- \nti6n rushed shouting after the crowd of retreat- \ning soldiers, ordering them back. Bagrati6n \nrode up to the ranks along which shots crackled \nnow here and now there, drowning the sound \nof voices and the shouts of command. The whole \nair reeked with smoke. The excited faces of the \nsoldiers were blackened with it. Some were \nusing their ramrods, others putting powder on \nthe touchpans or taking charges from their \npouches, while others were firing, though who \nthey were firing at could not be seen for the \nsmoke which there was no wind to carry away. \nA pleasant humming and whistling of bullets \nwere often heard. "What is this?" thought \nPrince Andrew approaching the crowd of sol- \ndiers. "It can't be an attack, for they are not \nmoving; it can't be a squarefor they are not \ndrawn up for that." \n\nThe commander of the regiment, a thin, \nfeeble-looking old man with a pleasant smile \nhis eyelids drooping more than half over his \nold eyes, giving him a mild expression, rode up \nto Bagrati6n and welcomed him as a host wel- \ncomes an honored guest. He reported that his \nregiment had been attacked by French cavalry \nand that, though the attack had been repulsed, \nhe had lost more than half his men. He said \nthe attack had been repulsed, employing this \nmilitary term to describe what had occurred to \nhis regiment, but in reality he did not himself \nknow what had happened during that half- \nhour to the troops entrusted to him, and could \nnot say with certainty whether the attack had \nbeen repulsed or his regiment had been bro- \nken up. All he knew was that at the commence- \nment of the action balls and shells began fly- \ning all over his regiment and hitting men and \nthat afterwards someone had shouted "Caval- \nry!" and our men had begun firing. They were \nstill firing, not at the cavalry which had disap- \npeared, but at French infantry who had come \ninto the hollow and were firing at our men. \nPrince Bagration bowed his head as a sign that \nthis was exactly what he had desired and ex- \npected. Turning to his adjutant he ordered \nhim to bring down the two battalions of the \nSixth Chasseurs whom they had just passed. \nPrince Andrew was struck by the changed ex- \npression on Prince Bagrati6n's face at this mo- \nment. It expressed the concentrated and hap- \npy resolution you see on the face of a man who \non a hot day takes a final run before plunging \n\n\n\ninto the water. The dull, sleepy expression was \nno longer there, nor the affectation of pro- \nfound thought. The round, steady, hawk's eyes \nlooked before him eagerly and rather disdain- \nfully, not resting on anything although his \nmovements were still slow and measured. \n\nThe commander of the regiment turned to \nPrince Bagration, entreating him to go back as \nit was too dangerous to remain where they \nwere. "Please, your excellency, for God'ssake!" \nhe kept saying, glancing for support at an of- \nficer of the suite who turned away from him. \n"There, you see!" and he drew attention to the \nbullets whistling, singing, and hissing continu- \nally around them. He spote in the tone of en- \ntreaty and reproach that a carpenter uses to a \ngentleman who has picked up an ax: "We are \nused to it, but you, sir, will blister your hands." \nHe spoke as if those bullets could not kill him, \nand his half-closed eyes gave still more persua- \nsiveness to his words. The staff officer joined in \nthe colonel's appeals, but Bagrati6n did not re- \nply; he only gave an order to cease firing and \nre-form, so as to give room for the two ap- \nproaching battalions. While he was speaking, \nthe curtain of smoke that had concealed the \nhollow, driven by a rising wind, began to move \nfrom right to left as if drawn by an invisible \nhand, and the hill opposite, with the French \nmoving about on it, opened out before them. \nAll eyes fastened involuntarily on this French \ncolumn advancing against them and winding \ndown over the uneven ground. One could al- \nready see the soldiers' shaggy caps, distinguish \nthe officers from the men, and see the standard \nflapping against its staff. \n\n"They march splendidly," remarked some- \none in Bagrati6n's suite. \n\nThe head of the column had already de- \nscended into the hollow. The clash would take \nplace on this side of it \n\nThe remains of our regiment which had been \nin action rapidly formed up and moved to the \nright; from behind it, dispersing the laggards, \ncame two battalions of the Sixth Chasseurs in \nfine order. Before they had reached Bagration, \nthe weighty tread of the mass of men marching \nin step could be heard. On their left flank, near- \nest to Bagrati6n, marched a company command- \ner, a fine round-faced man, with a stupid and \nhappy expressionthe same man who had \nrushed out of the wattle shed. At that moment \nhe was clearly thinking of nothing but how \ndashing a fellow he would appear as he passed \nthe commander. \n\nWith the self-satisfaction of a man on pa- \n\n\n\nBOOK TWO \n\n\n\nrade, he stepped lightly with his muscular legs \nas if sailing along, stretching himself to his full \nheight without the smallest effort, his ease con- \ntrasting with the heavy tread of the soldiers \nwho were keeping step with him. He carried \nclose to his leg a narrow unsheathed sword \n(small, curved, and not like a real weapon) and \nlooked now at the superior officers and now \nback at the men without losing step, his whole \npowerful body turning flexibly. It was as if all \nthe powers of his soul were concentrated on \npassing the commander in the best possible \nmanner, and feeling that he was doing it well \nhe was happy. "Left . . . left . . . left . . ." he \nseemed to repeat to himself at each alternate \nstep; and in time to this, with stern but varied \nfaces, the wall of soldiers burdened with knap- \nsacks and muskets marched in step, and each \none of these hundreds of soldiers seemed to be \nrepeating to himself at each alternate step, \n"Left . . . left . . . left ..." A fat major skirted \na bush, puffing and falling out of step; a sol- \ndier who had fallen behind, his face showing \nalarm at his defection, ran at a trot, panting to \ncatch up with his company. A cannon ball, \ncleaving the air, flew over the heads of Bagra- \ntion and his suite, and fell into the column to \nthe measure of "Left . . . left!" "Close up!" \ncame the company commander's voice in jaunty \ntones. The soldiers passed in a semicircle round \nsomething where the ball had fallen, and an \nold trooper on the flank, a noncommissioned \nofficer who had stopped beside the dead men, \nran to catch up his line and, falling into step \nwith a hop, looked back angrily, and through \nthe ominous silence and the regular tramp of \nfeet beating the ground in unison, one seemed \nto hear left . . . left . . . left. \n\n"Well done, lads!" said Prince Bagrati6n. \n\n"Glad to do our best, your ex'len-lencyl" \ncame a confused shout from the ranks. A mo- \nrose soldier marching on the left turned his \neyes on Bagrati6n as he shouted, with an ex- \npression that seemed to say: "We know that \nourselves!" Another, without looking round, \nas though fearing to relax, shouted with his \nmouth wide open and passed on. \n\nThe order was given to halt and down knap- \nsacks. \n\nBagrati6n rode round the ranks that had \nmarched past him and dismounted. He gave \nthe reins to a Cossack, took off and handed \nover his felt coat, stretched his legs, and set his \ncap straight. The head of the French column, \nwith its officers leading, appeared from below \nthe hill. \n\n\n\n101 \n\n"Forward, with God!" said Bagrati6n, in a \nresolute, sonorous voice, turning for a moment \nto the front line, and slightly swinging his \narms, he went forward uneasily over the rough \nfield with the awkward gait of a cavalryman. \nPrince Andrew felt that an invisible power was \nleading him forward, and experienced great \nhappiness. \n\nThe French were already near. Prince An- \ndrew, walking beside Bagrati6n, could clearly \ndistinguish their bandoliers, red epaulets, and \neven their faces. (He distinctly saw an old \nFrench officer who, with gaitered legs and \nturned-out toes, climbed the hill with difficul- \nty.) Prince Bagrati6n gave no further orders \nand silently continued to walk on in front of \nthe ranks. Suddenly one shot after another rang \nout from the French, smoke appeared all along \ntheir uneven ranks, and musket shots sounded. \nSeveral of our men fell, among them the round- \nfaced officer who had marched so gaily and \ncomplacently. But at the moment the first re- \nport was heard, Bagrati6n looked round and \nshouted, "Hurrah!" \n\n"Hurrah ah! ah!" rang a long-drawn shout \nfrom our ranks, and passing Bagrati6n and rac- \ning one another they rushed in an irregular \nbut joyous and eager crowd down the hill at \ntheir disordered foe. \n\nCHAPTER XIX \n\nTHE ATTACK of the Sixth Chasseurs secured the \nretreat of our right flank. In the center Tu- \nshin's forgotten battery, which had managed \nto set fire to theSchon Grabern village, delayed \nthe French advance. The French were putting \nout the fire which the wind was spreading, and \nthus gave us time to retreat. The retirement of \nthe center to the other side of the dip in the \nground at the rear was hurried and noisy, but \nthe different companies did not get mixed. But \nour left which consisted of the Az6v and Po- \nd61sk infantry and the Pavlograd hussars was \nsimultaneously attacked and outflanked by su- \nperior French forces under Lannes and was \nthrown into confusion. Bagrati6n had sent \nZherk6v to the general commanding that left \nflank with orders to retreat immediately. \n\nZherk6v, not removing his hand from his \ncap, turned his horse about and galloped off. \nBut no sooner had he left Bagrati6n than his \ncourage failed him. He was seized by panic and \ncould not go where it was dangerous. \n\nHaving reached the left flank, instead of go- \ning to the front where the firing was, he began \nto look for the general and his staff where they \n\n\n\n102 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\ncould not possibly be, and so did not deliver \nthe order. \n\nThe command of the left flank belonged by \nseniority to the commander of the regiment \nKutiizov had reviewed at Braunau and in which \nD61okhovwas serving as a private. But the com- \nmand of the extreme left flank had been as- \nsigned to the commander of the Pdvlograd regi- \nment in which Rost6v was serving, and a mis- \nunderstanding arose. The two commanders \nwere much exasperated with one another and, \nlong after the action had begun on the right \nflank and the French were already advancing, \nwere engaged in discussion with the sole ob- \nject of offending one another. But the regi- \nments, both cavalry and infantry, were by no \nmeans ready for the impending action. From \nprivates to general they were not expecting a \nbattle and were engaged in peaceful occupa- \ntions, the cavalry feeding the horses and the \ninfantry collecting wood. \n\n"He higher iss dan I in rank," said the Ger- \nman colonel of the hussars, flushing and ad- \ndressing an adjutant who had ridden up, "so let \nhim do vhat he vill, but I cannot sacrifice my \nhussars . . . Bugler, sount ze retreat!" \n\nBut haste was becoming imperative. Cannon \nand musketry, mingling together, thundered \non the right and in the center, while the ca- \npotes of Lannes' sharpshooters were already \nseen crossing the milldamand forming up with- \nin twice the range of a musket shot. The gen- \neral in command of the infantry went toward \nhis horse with jerky steps, and having mounted \ndrew himself up very straight and tall and rode \nto the Piivlograd commander. The command- \ners met with polite bows but with secret malev- \nolence in their hearts. \n\n"Once again, Colonel," said the general, "I \ncan't leave half my men in the wood. I beg of \nyou, I beg of you," he repeated, "to occupy the \nposition and prepare for an attack." \n\n"I peg of you yourself not to mix in vot is \nnot your pusiness!" suddenly replied the irate \ncolonel. "If you vere in the cavalry . . ." \n\n"I am not in the cavalry, Colonel, but I am a \nRussian general and if you are not aware of \nthe fact . . ." \n\n"Quite avare, your excellency," suddenly \nshouted the colonel, touching his horse and \nturning purple in the face. "Vill you be so goot \nto come to ze front and see dat zis position iss \nno goot? I don't vish to desstroy my men for \nyour pleasurel" \n\n"You forget yourself, Colonel. I am not \nconsidering my own pleasure and I won't \n\n\n\nallow it to be said I" \n\nTaking the colonel's outburst as a challenge \nto his courage, the general expanded his chest \nand rode, frowning, beside him to the front \nline, as if their differences would be settled \nthere amongst the bullets. They reached the \nfront, several bullets sped over them, and they \nhalted in silence. There was nothing fresh to \nbe seen from the line, for from where they had \nbeen before it had been evident that it was im- \npossible for cavalry to act among the bushes \nand broken ground, as well as that the French \nwere outflanking our left. Thegeneral and colo- \nnel looked sternly and significantly at one an- \nother like two fighting cocks preparing for bat- \ntle, each vainly trying to detect signs of coward- \nice in the other. Both passed the examination \nsuccessfully. As there was nothing to be said, and \nneither wished to give occasion for it to be al- \nleged that he had been the first to leave the \nrange of fire, they would have remained there \nfor a long time testing each other's courage \nhad it not been that just then they heard the \nrattle of musketry and a muffled shout almost \nbehind them in the wood. The French had at- \ntacked the men collecting wood in the copse. It \nwas no longer possible for the hussars to re- \ntreat with the infantry. They were cut off from \nthe line of retreat on the left by the French. \nHowever inconvenient the position, it was now \nnecessary to attack in order to cut away through \nfor themselves. \n\nThe squadron in which Rost6v was serving \nhad scarcely time to mount before it was halted \nfacing the enemy. Again, as at the Enns bridge, \nthere was nothing between the squadron and \nthe enemy, and again that terrible dividing \nline of uncertainty and fearresembling the \nline separating the living from the dead lay \nbetween them. All were conscious of this un- \nseen line, and the question whether they would \ncross it or not, and how they would cross it, \nagitated them all. \n\nThe colonel rode to the front, angrily gave \nsome reply to questions put to him by the of- \nficers, and, like a man desperately insisting on \nhaving his own way, gave an order. No one \nsaid anything definite, but the rumor of an at- \ntack spread through the squadron. The com- \nmand to form up rang out and the sabers \nwhizzed as they were drawn from their scab- \nbards. Still no one moved. The troops of \nthe left flank, infantry and hussars alike, felt \nthat the commander did not himself know \nwhat to do, and this irresolution communi- \ncated itself to the men. \n\n\n\nBOOK TWO \n\n\n\n103 \n\n\n\n"If only they would be quick!" thought Ros- \nt6v, feeling that at last the time had come to \nexperience the joy of an attack of which he had \nso often heard from his fellow hussars. \n\n"Fo'ward, with God, lads!" rang out Denf- \nsov's voice. "At a twot fo'wardl" \n\nThe horses' croups began to sway in the front \nline. Rook pulled at the reins and started of \nhis own accord. \n\nBefore him, on the right, Rost6v saw the \nfront lines of his hussars and still farther ahead \na dark line which he could not see distinctly \nbut took to be the enemy. Shots could be heard, \nbut some way off. \n\n"Faster!" came the word of command, and \nRost6v felt Rook's flanks drooping as he broke \ninto a gallop. \n\nRost6v anticipated his horse's movements \nand became more and more elated. He had \nnoticed a solitary tree ahead of him. This tree \nhad been in the middle of the line that had \nseemed so terrible and now he had crossed \nthat line and not only was there nothing ter- \nrible, but everything was becoming more and \nmore happy and animated. "Oh, how I will \nslash at him!" thought Rost6v, gripping the \nhilt of his saber. \n\n"Hur-a-a-a-ah!" came a roar of voices. "Let \nanyone come my way now," thought Rost6v \ndriving his spurs into Rook and letting him go \nat a full gallop so that he outstripped the oth- \ners. Ahead, the enemy was already visible. Sud- \ndenly something like a birch broom seemed to \nsweep over the squadron. Rost6v raised his sa- \nber, ready to strike, but at that instant the \ntrooper Nikitenko, who was galloping ahead, \nshot away from him, and Rost6v felt as in a \ndream that he continued to be carried forward \nwith unnatural speed but yet stayed on the \nsame spot. From behind him Bondarchuk, an \nhussar he knew, jolted against him and looked \nangrily at him. Bondarchiik's horse swerved \nand galloped past. \n\n"How is it I am not moving? I have fallen, I \nam killed!" Rost6v asked and answered at the \nsame instant. He was alone in the middle of a \nfield. Instead of the moving horses and hussars' \nbacks, he saw nothing before him but the mo- \ntionless earth and the stubble around him. \nThere was warm blood under his arm. "No, I \nam wounded and the horse is killed." Rook \ntried to rise on his forelegs but fell back, pin- \nning his rider's leg. Blood was flowing from his \nhead; he struggled but could not rise. Rost6v \nalso tried to rise but fell back, his sabretache \nhaving become entangled in the saddle. Where \n\n\n\nour men were, and where the French, he did \nnot know. There was no one near. \n\nHavingdisentangledhisleg,herose. "Where, \non which side, was now the line that had so \nsharply divided the two armies?" he asked him- \nself and could not answer. "Can something \nbad have happened to me?" he wondered as he \ngot up: and at that moment he felt that some- \nthing superfluous was hangingon his benumbed \nleft arm. The wrist felt as if it were not his. He \nexamined his hand carefully, vainly trying to \nfind blood on it. "Ah, here are people com- \ning," he thought joyfully, seeing some men run- \nning toward him. "They will help me!" In \nfront came a man wearing a strange shako and \na blue cloak, swarthy, sunburned, and with a \nhooked nose. Then came two more, and many \nmore running behind. One of them said some- \nthing strange, not in Russian. In among the \nhindmost of these men wearing similar shakos \nwas a Russian hussar. He was being held by \nthe arms and his horse was being led behind \nhim. \n\n"It must be one of ours, a prisoner. Yes. Can \nit be that they will take me too? Who are these \nmen?" thought Rost6v, scarcely believing his \neyes. "Can they be French?" He looked at the \napproaching Frenchmen, and though but a \nmoment before he had been galloping to get at \nthem and hack them to pieces, their proximity \nnow seemed so awful that he could not believe \nhis eyes. "Who are they? Why are they run- \nning? Can they be coming at me? And why? To \nkill me? Me whom everyone is so fond of?" He \nremembered his mother's love for him, and his \nfamily's, and his friends', and the enemy's in- \ntention to kill him seemed impossible. "But \nperhaps they may do it!" For more than ten \nseconds he stood not moving from the spot or \nrealizing the situation. The foremost French- \nman, the one with the hooked nose, was al- \nready so close that the expression of his face \ncould be seen. And the excited, alien face of \nthat man, his bayonet hanging down, holding \nhis breath, and running so lightly, frightened \nRost6v. He seized his pistol and, instead of fir- \ning it, flung it at the Frenchman and ran with \nall his might toward the bushes. He did not \nnow run with the feeling of doubt and conflict \nwith which he had trodden the Enns bridge, \nbut with the feeling of a hare fleeing from the \nhounds. One single sentiment, that of fear for \nhis young and happy life, possessed his whole \nbeing. Rapidly leaping the furrows, he fled \nacross the field with the impetuosity he used to \nshow at catchplay, now and then turning his \n\n\n\n104 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\ngood-natured, pale, young face to look back. A \nshudder of terror went through him: "No, bet- \nter not look," he thought, but having reached \nthe bushes he glanced round once more. The \nFrench had fallen behind, and just as he looked \nround the first man changed his run to a walk \nand, turning, shouted something loudly to a \ncomrade farther back. Rost6v paused. "No, \nthere's some mistake," thought he. "They can't \nhave wanted to kill me." But at the same time, \nhis left arm felt as heavy as if a seventy-pound \nweight were tied to it. He could run no more. \nThe Frenchman also stopped and took aim. \nRost6v closed his eyes and stooped down. One \nbullet and then another whistled past him. He \nmustered his last remaining strength, took hold \nof his left hand with his right, and reached the \nbushes. Behind these were some Russian sharp- \nshooters. \n\nCHAPTER XX \n\nTHE INFANTRY regiments that had been caught \nunawares in the outskirts of the wood ran out \nof it, the different companies getting mixed, \nand retreated as a disorderly crowd. One sol- \ndier, in his fear, uttered the senseless cry, "Cut \noff!" that is so terrible in battle, and that word \ninfected the whole crowd with a feeling of \npanic. \n\n"Surrounded! Cut off! We're lost!" shouted \nthe fugitives. \n\nThe moment he heard the firing and the cry \nfrom behind, the general realized that some- \nthing dreadful had happened to his regiment, \nand the thought that he, an exemplary officer \nof many years' service who had never been to \nblame, might be held responsible at headquar- \nters for negligence or inefficiency so staggered \nhim that, forgetting the recalcitrant cavalry \ncolonel, his own dignity as a general, and above \nall quite forgetting the danger and all regard \nfor self-preservation, he clutched the crupper \nof his saddle and, spurring his horse, galloped \nto the regiment under a hail of bullets which \nfell around, but fortunately missed him. His \none desire was to know what was happening \nand at any cost correct, or remedy, the mistake \nif he had made one, so that he, an exemplary \nofficer of twenty-two years' service, who had \nnever been censured, should not be held to \nblame. \n\nHaving galloped safely through the French, \nhe reached afield behind the copse across which \nour men, regardless of orders, were running \nand descending the valley. That moment of \nmoral hesitation which decides the fate of bat- \n\n\n\ntles had arrived. Would this disorderly crowd \nof soldiers attend to the voice of their command- \ner, or would they, disregarding him, continue \ntheir flight? Despite his desperate shouts that \nused to seem so terrible to the soldiers, despite \nhis furious purple countenance distorted out \nof all likeness to his former self, and the flour- \nishing of his saber, the soldiers all continued to \nrun, talking, firing into the air, and disobeying \norders. The moral hesitation which decided the \nfate of battles was evidently culminating in a \npanic. \n\nThe general had a fit of coughing as a result \nof shouting and of the powder smoke and \nstopped in despair. Everything seemed lost. But \nat that moment the French who were attack- \ning, suddenly and without any apparent rea- \nson, ran back and disappeared from the out- \nskirts, and Russian sharpshooters showed them- \nselves in the copse. It was Tim6khin's com- \npany, which alone had maintained its order in \nthe wood and, having lain in ambush in a \nditch, now attacked the French unexpectedly. \nTim6khin, armed only with a sword, had rushed \nat the enemy with such a desperate cry and such \nmad, drunken determination that, taken by \nsurprise, the French had thrown down their \nmuskets and run. D61okhov, running beside \nTimtikhin, killed a Frenchman at close quar- \nters and was the first to seize the surrendering \nFrench officer by his collar. Our fugitives re- \nturned, the battalions re-formed, and the \nFrench who had nearly cut our left flank in \nhalf were for the moment repulsed. Our re- \nserve units were able to join up, and the fight \nwas at an end. The regimental commander \nand Major Ekon6mov had stopped beside a \nbridge, letting the retreating companies pass \nby them, when a soldier came up and took hold \nof the commander's stirrup, almost leaning' \nagainst him. The man was wearing a bluish \ncoat of broadcloth, he had no knapsack or cap, \nhis head was bandaged, and over his shoulder a \nFrench munition pouch was slung. He had an \nofficer's sword in his hand. The soldier was \npale, his blue eyes looked impudently into the \ncommander's face, and his lips were smiling. \nThough the commander was occupied in giv- \ning instructions to Major Ekon6mov, he could \nnot help taking notice of the soldier. \n\n"Your excellency, here are two trophies," \nsaid Ddlokhov, pointing to the French sword \nand pouch. "I have taken an officer prisoner. 1 \nstopped the company." D61okhov breathed \nheavily from weariness and spoke in abrupt \nsentences. "The whole company can bear wit- \n\n\n\nBOOK TWO \n\n\n\n105 \n\n\n\nness. I beg you will remember this, your excel- \nlency!" \n\n"All right, all right," replied the command- \ner, and turned to Major Ekon6mov. \n\nBut D61okhov did not go away; he untied \nthe handkerchief around his head, pulled it \noff, and showed the blood congealed on his \nhair. \n\n"A bayonet wound. I remained at the front. \nRemember, your excellency!" \n\nTushin's battery had been forgotten and on- \nly at the very end of the action did Prince Ba- \ngration, still hearing the cannonade in the cen- \nter, send his orderly staff officer, and later \nPrince Andrew also, to order the battery to re- \ntire as quickly as possible. When the supports \nattached to Tushin's battery had been moved \naway in the middle of the action by someone's \norder, the battery had continued firing and \nwas only not captured by the French because \nthe enemy could not surmise that anyone could \nhave the effrontery to continue firing from \nfour quite undefended guns. On the contrary, \nthe energetic action of that battery led the \nFrench to suppose that here in the center \nthe main Russian forces were concentrated. \nTwice they had attempted to attack this point, \nbut on each occastion had been driven back by \ngrapeshot from the four isolated guns on the \nhillock. \n\nSoon after Prince Bagrati6n had left him, \nTushin had succeeded in setting fire to Schon \nGrabern. \n\n"Look at them scurrying! It's burning! Just \nsee the smoke! Fine! Grand! Look at the smoke, \nthe smoke! "exclaimed the artillerymen, bright- \nening up. \n\nAll the guns, without waiting for orders, \nwere being fired in the direction of the confla- \ngration. As if urging each other on, the soldiers \ncried at each shot: "Fine! That's good! Look at \nit ... Grand!" The fire, fanned by the breeze, \nwas rapidly spreading. The French columns \nthat had advanced beyond the village went \nback; but as though in revenge for this failure, \nthe enemy placed ten guns to the right of the \nvillage and began firing them at Tiishin's bat- \ntery. \n\nIn their childlike glee, aroused by the fire \nand their luck in successfully cannonading the \nFrench, our artillerymen only noticed this bat- \ntery when two balls, and then four more, fell \namong our guns, one knocking over two horses \nand another tearing off a munition-wagon driv- \ner's leg. Their spirits once roused were, how- \n\n\n\never, not diminished, but only changed char- \nacter. The horses were replaced by others from \na reserve gun carriage, the wounded were car- \nried away, and the four guns were turned \nagainst the ten-gun battery. Tushin's compan- \nion officer had been killed at the beginning of \nthe engagement and within an hour seventeen \nof the forty men of the guns' crews had been \ndisabled, but the artillerymen were still as \nmerry and lively as ever. Twice they noticed \nthe French appearing below them, and then \nthey fired grapeshot at them. \n\nLittle Tushin, moving feebly and awkward- \nly, kept telling his orderly to "refill my pipe for \nthat one!" and then, scattering sparks from it, \nran forward shading his eyes with his small \nhand to look at the French. \n\n"Smack at 'em, lads!" he kept saying, seizing \nthe guns by the wheels and working the screws \nhimself. \n\nAmid the smoke, deafened by the incessant \nreports which always made him jump, Tushin \nnot taking his pipe from his mouth ran from \ngun to gun, now aiming, now counting the \ncharges, now giving orders about replacing \ndead or wounded horses and harnessing fresh \nones, and shouting in his feeble voice, so high- \npitched and irresolute. His face grew more and \nmore animated. Only when a man was killed \nor wounded did he frown and turn away from \nthe sight, shouting angrily at the men who, as \nis always the case, hesitated about lifting the \ninjured or dead. The soldiers, for the most part \nhandsome fellows and, as is always the case in \nan artillery company, a head and shoulders \ntaller and twice as broad as their officer all \nlooked at their commander like children in an \nembarrassing situation, and the expression on \nhis face was invariably reflected on theirs. \n\nOwing to the terrible uproar and the neces- \nsity for concentration and activity, Tushin did \nnot experience the slightest unpleasant sense \nof fear, and the thought that he might be killed \nor badly wounded never occurred to him. On \nthe contrary, he became more and more elated. \nIt seemed to him that it was a very long time \nago, almost a day, since he had first seen the \nenemy and fired the first shot, and that the \ncorner of the field he stood on was well-known \nand familiar ground. Though he thought of \neverything, considered everything, and did \neverything the best of officers could do in his \nposition, he was in a state akin to feverish de- \nlirium or drunkenness. \n\nFrom the deafening sounds of his own guns \naround him, the whistle and thud of the \n\n\n\nio6 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nenemy's cannon balls, from the flushed and \nperspiring faces of the crew bustling round the \nguns, from the sight of the blood of men and \nhorses, from the little puffs of smoke on the en- \nemy's side (always followed by a ball flying past \nand striking the earth, a man, a gun, a horse), \nfrom the sight of all these things a fantastic \nworld of his own had taken possession of his \nbrain and at that moment afforded him pleas- \nure. The enemy's guns were in his fancy not \nguns but pipes from which occasional puffs \nwere blown by an invisible smoker. \n\n"There . . . he's puffing again," muttered \nTushin to himself, as a small cloud rose from \nthe hill and was borne in a streak to the left \nby the wind. \n\n"Now look out for the ball . . . we'll throw it \nback/' \n\n"What do you want, your honor?" asked an \nartilleryman, standing close by, who heard him \nmuttering. \n\n"Nothing . . . only a shell . . ." he answered. \n\n"Come along, our Matve*vna!" he said to \nhimself. "Matvdvna" * was the name his fancy \ngave to the farthest gun of the battery, which was \nlarge and of an old pattern. The French swarm- \ning round their guns seemed to him like ants. \nIn that world, the handsome drunkard Num- \nber One of the second gun's crew was "uncle"; \nTushin looked at him more often than at any- \none else and took delight in his every move- \nment. The sound of musketry at the foot of the \nhill, now diminishing, now increasing, seemed \nlike someone's breathing. He listened intently \nto the ebb and flow of these sounds. \n\n"Ah! Breathing again, breathingl" he mut- \ntered to himself. \n\nHe imagined himself as an enormously tall, \npowerful man who was throwing cannon balls \nat the French with both hands. \n\n"Now then, Matvvna, dear old lady, don't \nlet me downl" he was saying as he moved from \nthe gun, when a strange, unfamiliar voice called \nabove his head: "Captain Tushin! Captain!" \n\nTushin turned round in dismay. It was the \nstaff officer who had turned him out of the \nbooth at Grunth. He was shouting in a gasping \nvoice: \n\n"Are you mad? You have twice been ordered \nto retreat, and you . . ." \n\n"Why are they down on me?" thought Tu- \nshin, looking in alarm at his superior. \n\n"I ... don't . . ." he muttered, holding up \ntwo fingers to his cap. "I . . ." \n\nBut the staff officer did not finish what he \n\n1 Daughter of Mathcw. \n\n\n\nwanted to say. A cannon ball, flying close to \nhim, caused him to duck and bend over his \nhorse. He paused, and just as he was about to \nsay something more, another ball stopped him. \nHe turned his horse and galloped off. \n\n"Retire! All to retire!" he shouted from a \ndistance. \n\nThe soldiers laughed. A moment later, an \nadjutant arrived with the same order. \n\nIt was Prince Andrew. The first thing he saw \non riding up to the space where Tushin's guns \nwere stationed was an unharnessed horse with \na broken leg, that lay screaming piteously be- \nside the harnessed horses. Blood was gushing \nfrom its leg as from a spring. Among the lim- \nbers lay several dead men. One ball after an- \nother passed over as he approached and he felt \na nervous shudder run down his spine. But the \nmere thought of being afraid roused him \nagain. "I cannot be afraid," thought he, and dis- \nmounted slowly among the guns. He delivered \nthe order and did not leave the battery. He de- \ncided to have the guns removed from their \npositions and withdrawn in his presence. To- \ngether with Tushin, stepping across the bodies \nand under a terrible fire from the French, he \nattended to the removal of the guns. \n\n"A staff officer was here a minute ago, but \nskipped off," said an artilleryman to Prince \nAndrew. "Not like your honor!" \n\nPrince Andrew said nothing to Tushin. They \nwere both so busy as to seem not to notice one \nanother. When having limbered up the only \ntwo cannon that remained uninjured out of \nthe four, they began moving down the hill \n(one shattered gun and one unicorn were left \nbehind), Prince Andrew rode up to Tushin. \n\n"Well, till we meet again . . ." he said, hold- \ning out his hand to Tushin. \n\n"Good-by, my dear fellow/' said Tiishin. \n"Dear soul! Good-by, my dear fellow!" and for \nsome unknown reason tears suddenly filled his \neyes. \n\nCHAPTER XXI \n\nTHE WIND had fallen and black clouds, merg- \ning with the powder smoke, hung low over the \nfield of battle on the horizon. It was growing \ndark and the glow of two conflagrations was \nthe more conspicuous. The cannonade was dy- \ning down, but the rattle of musketry behind \nand on the right sounded oftener and nearer. \nAs soon as Tushin with his guns, continually \ndriving round or coming upon wounded men, \nwas out of range of fire and had descended in- \nto the dip, he was met by some of the staff, \n\n\n\nBOOK TWO \n\n\n\n107 \n\n\n\namong them the staff officer and Zherk6v, who \nhad been twice sent to Tiishin's battery but \nhad never reached it. Interrupting one anoth- \ner, they all gave, and transmitted, orders as to \nhow to proceed, reprimanding and reproach- \ning him. Tushin gave no orders, and silently \nfearing to speak because at every word he felt \nready to weep without knowing why rode be- \nhind on his artillery nag. Though the orders \nwere to abandon the wounded, many of them \ndragged themselves after the troops and begged \nfor seats on the gun carriages. The jaunty in- \nfantry officer who just before the battle had \nrushed out of Tushin's wattle shed was laid, \nwith a bullet in his stomach, on "Matvc*vna's" \ncarriage. At the foot of the hill, a pale hussar \ncadet, supporting one hand with the other, came \nup to Tushin and asked for a seat. \n\n"Captain, for God's sake! I've hurt my arm," \nhe said timidly. "For God's sake ... I can't \nwalk. For God's sakel" \n\nIt was plain that this cadet had already re- \npeatedly asked for a lift and been refused. He \nasked in a hesitating, piteous voice. \n\n"Tell them to give me a seat, for God's sakel" \n\n"Give him a seat," said Tushin. "Lay a cloak \nfor him to sit on, lad," he said, addressing his \nfavorite soldier. "And where is the wounded \nofficer?" \n\n"He has been set down. He died," replied \nsomeone. \n\n"Help him up. Sit down, dear fellow, sit \ndown I Spread out the cloak, Antonov." \n\nThe cadet was Rost6v. With one hand he \nsupported the other; he was pale and his jaw \ntrembled, shivering feverishly. He was placed \non "Matvvna," the gun from which they had \nremoved the dead officer. The cloak they spread \nunder him was wet with blood which stained \nhis breeches and arm. \n\n"What, are you wounded, my lad?" said Tu- \nshin, approaching the gun on which Rost6v sat. \n\n"No, it's a sprain." \n\n"Then what is this blood on the gun car- \nriage?" inquired Tushin. \n\n"It was the officer, your honor, stained it," \nanswered the artilleryman, wiping away the \nblood with his coat sleeve, as if apologizing for \nthe state of his gun. \n\nIt was all that they could do to get the guns \nup the rise aided by the infantry, and having \nreached the village of Gruntersdorf they halted. \nIt had grown so dark that one could not dis- \ntinguish the uniforms ten paces off, and the \nfiring had begun to subside. Suddenly, near by \non the right, shouting and firing were again \n\n\n\nheard. Flashes of shot gleamed in the darkness. \nThis was the last French attack and was met by \nsoldiers who had sheltered in the village houses. \nThey all rushed out of the village again, but \nTushin's guns could not move, and the artil- \nlerymen, Tushin, and the cadet exchanged si- \nlent glances as they awaited their fate. The fir- \ning died down and soldiers, talking eagerly, \nstreamed out of a side street. \n\n"Not hurt, Pctr6v?" asked one. \n\n"We've given it 'em hot, mate! They won't \nmake another push now," said another. \n\n"You couldn't see a thing. How they shot at \ntheir own fellows! Nothing could be seen. \nPitch-dark, brother! Isn't there something to \ndrink?" \n\nThe French had been repulsed for the last \ntime. And again and again in the complete \ndarkness Tushin's guns moved forward, sur- \nrounded by the humming infantry as by a \nframe. \n\nIn the darkness, it seemed as though a gloomy \nunseen river was flowing always in one direc- \ntion, humming with whispers and talk and the \nsound of hoofs and wheels. Amid the general \nrumble, the groans and voices of the wounded \nwere more distinctly heard than any other \nsound in the darkness of the night. The gloom \nthat enveloped the army was filled with their \ngroans, which seemed to melt into one with the \ndarkness of the night. After a while the mov- \ning mass became agitated, someone rode past \non a white horse followed by his suite, and \nsaid something in passing: "What did he say? \nWhere to, now? Halt, is it? Did he thank us?" \ncame eager questions from all sides. The whole \nmoving mass began pressing closer together \nand a report spread that they were ordered to \nhalt: evidently those in front had halted. All \nremained where they were in the middle of the \nmuddy road. \n\nFires were lighted and the talk became more \naudible. Captain Tushin, having given orders \nto his company, sent a soldier to find a dressing \nstation or a doctor for the cadet, and sat down \nby a bonfire the soldiers had kindled on the \nroad. Rost6v, too, dragged himself to the fire. \nFrom pain, cold, and damp, a feverish shiver- \ning shook his whole body. Drowsiness was ir- \nresistibly mastering him, but he was keptawake \nby an excruciating pain in his arm, for which \nhe could find no satisfactory position. He kept \nclosing his eyes and then again looking at the \nfire, which seemed to him dazzlingly red, and \nat the feeble, round-shouldered figure of Tu- \nshin who was sitting cross-legged like a Turk \n\n\n\nio8 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nbeside him. Ttishin's large, kind, intelligent \neyes were fixed with sympathy and commisera- \ntion on Rost6v, who saw that Tushin with his \nwhole heart wished to help him but could not. \n\nFrom all sides were heard the footsteps and \ntalk of the infantry, who were walking, driv- \ning past, and settling down all around. The \nsound of voices, the tramping feet, the horses' \nhoofs moving in mud, the crackling of wood \nfires near and afar, merged into one tremu- \nlous rumble. \n\nIt was no longer, as before, a dark, unseen \nriver flowing through the gloom, but a dark \nsea swelling and gradually subsiding after a \nstorm. Rost6v looked at and listened listlessly \nto what passed before and around him. An in- \nfantryman came to the fire, squatted on his \nheels, held his hands to the blaze, and turned \naway his face. \n\n"You don't mind, your honor?" he asked Tu- \nshin. "I've lost my company, your honor. I \ndon't know where . . . such bad luck!" \n\nWith the soldier, an infantry officer with a \nbandaged cheek came up to the bonfire, and \naddressing Tushin asked him to have the guns \nmoved a trifle to let a wagon go past. After he \nhad gone, two soldiers rushed to the campfire. \nThey were quarreling and fighting desperately, \neach trying to snatch from the other a boot \nthey were both holding on to. \n\n"You picked it up? ... I dare say! You're \nvery smart!" one of them shouted hoarsely. \n\nThen a thin, pale soldier, his neck band- \naged with a bloodstained leg band, came up \nand in angry tones asked the artillerymen for \nwater. \n\n"Must one die like a dog?" said he. \n\nTushin told them to give the man some wa- \nter. Then a cheerful soldier ran up, begging a \nlittle fire for the infantry. \n\n"A nice little hot torch for the infantry! \nGood luck to you, fellow countrymen. Thanks \nfor the firewe'll return it with interest," said \nhe, carrying away into the darkness a glowing \nstick. \n\nNext came four soldiers, carrying something \nheavy on a cloak, and passed by the fire. One \nof them stumbled. \n\n"Who the devil has put the logs on the \nroad?" snarled he. \n\n"He's deadwhy carry him?" said another. \n\n"Shut up!" \n\nAnd they disappeared into the darkness with \ntheir load. \n\n"Still aching?" Tiishin asked Rost6v in a \nwhisper. \n\n\n\n"Yes." \n\n"Your honor, you're wanted by the general. \nHe is in the hut here," said a gunner, coming \nup to Tushin. \n\n"Coming, friend." \n\nTushin rose and, buttoning his greatcoat \nand pulling it straight, walked away from the \nfire. \n\nNot far from the artillery campfire, in a hut \nthat had been prepared for him, Prince Bagra- \nti6n sat at dinner, talkingwith some command- \ning officers who had gathered at his quarters. \nThe little old man with the half-closed eyes \nwas there greedily gnawing a mutton bone, and \nthe general who had served blamelessly for \ntwenty- two years, flushed by a glass of vodka \nand the dinner; and the staff officer with the \nsignet ring, and Zhcrk6v, uneasily glancing at \nthem all, and Prince Andrew, pale, with com- \npressed lips and feverishly glittering eyes. \n\nIn a corner of the hut stood a standard cap- \ntured from the French, and theaccountantwith \nthe nai've face was feeling its texture, shaking \nhis head in perplexity perhaps because the \nbanner really interested him, perhaps because \nit was hard for him, hungry as he was, to look \non at a dinner where there was no place for \nhim. In the next hut there was a French colonel \nwho had been taken prisoner by our dragoons. \nOur officers were flocking in to look at him. \nPrince Bagrati6n was thanking the individual \ncommanders and inquiring into details of the \naction and our losses. The general whose regi- \nment had been inspected at Braunau was in- \nforming the prince that as soon as the action \nbegan he had withdrawn from the wood, mus- \ntered the men who were woodcutting, and, al- \nlowing the French to pass him, had made a \nbayonet charge with two battalions and had \nbroken up the French troops. \n\n"When I saw, your excellency, that their first \nbattalion was disorganized, I stopped in the \nroad and thought: 'I'll let them come on and \nwill meet them with the fire of the whole bat- \ntalion' and that's what I did." \n\nThe general had so wished to do this and \nwas so sorry he had not managed to do it that \nit seemed to him as if it had really happened. \nPerhaps it might really have been so? Could \none possibly make out amid all that confusion \nwhat did or did not happen? \n\n"By the way, your excellency, I should inform \nyou," he continued remembering D61okhov's \nconversation with Kutuzov and his last inter- \nview with the gentleman-ranker "that Private \nD61okhov, who was reduced to the ranks, took \n\n\n\nBOOK \n\na French officer prisoner in my presence and \nparticularly distinguished himself/' \n\n"I saw the Pdvlograd hussars attack there, \nyour excellency," chimed in Zherk6v, looking \nuneasily around. He had not seen the hussars \nall that day, but had heard about them from an \ninfantry officer. "They broke up two squares, \nyour excellency/' \n\nSeveral of those present smiled at Zherk6v's \nwords, expecting one of his usual jokes, but \nnoticing that what he was saying redounded to \nthe glory of our arms and of the day's work, \nthey assumed a serious expression, though \nmany of them knew that what he was saying \nwas a lie devoid of any foundation. Prince Ba- \ngrati6n turned to the old colonel: \n\n"Gentlemen, I thank you all; all arms have \nbehaved heroically: infantry, cavalry, and ar- \ntillery. How was it that two guns were aban- \ndoned in the center?" he inquired, searching \nwith his eyes for someone. (Prince Bagrati6n \ndid not ask about the guns on the left flank; he \nknew that all the guns there had been aban- \ndoned at the very beginning of the action.) "I \nthink I sent you?" he added, turning to the \nstaff officer on duty. \n\n"One was damaged," answered the staff offi- \ncer, "and the other I can't understand. I was \nthere all the time giving orders and had only \n\njust left It is true that it was hot there," he \n\nadded, modestly. \n\nSomeone mentioned that Captain Tushin \nwas bivouacking close to the village and had al- \nready been sent for. \n\n"Oh, but you were there?" said Prince Bagra- \ntion, addressing Prince Andrew. \n\n"Of course, weonly just missed one another," \nsaid the staff officer, with a smile to Bolk6nski. \n\n"I had not the pleasure of seeing you," said \nPrince Andrew, coldly and abruptly. \n\nAll were silent. Tushin appeared at the \nthreshold and made his way timidly from be- \nhind the backs of the generals. As he stepped \npast the generals in the crowded hut, feeling \nembarrassed as he always was by the sight of his \nsuperiors, he did not notice the staff of the \nbanner and stumbled over it. Several of those \npresent laughed. \n\n"How was it a gun was abandoned?" asked \nBagrati6n, frowning, not so much at the cap- \ntain as at those who were laughing, among \nwhom Zherk6v laughed loudest. \n\nOnly now, when he was confronted by the \nstern authorities, did his guilt and the disgrace \nof having lost two guns and yet remaining alive \npresent themselves to Tushin in all their hor- \n\n\n\nTWO 109 \n\nror. He had been so excited that he had not \nthought about it until that moment. The offi- \ncers' laughter confused himstill more. Hestood \nbefore Bagrati6n with his lower jaw trembling \nand was hardly able to mutter: "I don't know \n. . . your excellency ... I had no men . . . your \nexcellency." \n\n"You might have taken some from the cov- \nering troops." \n\nTushin did not say that there were no cov- \nering troops, though that was perfectly true. \nHe was afraid of getting some other officer in- \nto trouble, and silently fixed his eyes on Ba- \ngrati6n as a schoolboy who has blundered looks \nat an examiner. \n\nThe silence lasted some time. Prince Bagra- \nti6n, apparently not wishing to be severe, found \nnothing to say; the others did not venture to \nintervene. Prince Andrew looked at Tushin \nfrom under his brows and his fingers twitched \nnervously. \n\n"Your excellency!" Prince Andrew broke the \nsilence with his abrupt voice, "you were pleased \nto send me to Captain Tiishin's battery. I went \nthere and found two thirds of the men and \nhorses knocked out, two guns smashed, and no \nsupports at all." \n\nPrince Bagrati6n and Tushin looked with \nequal intentness at Bolk6nski, who spoke with \nsuppressed agitation. \n\n"And, if your excellency will allow me to \nexpress my opinion," he continued, "we owe \ntoday's success chiefly to the action of that bat- \ntery and the heroic endurance of Captain Tu- \nshin and his company," and without awaiting \na reply, Prince Andrew rose and left the table. \n\nPrince Bagrati6n looked at Tushin, evident- \nly reluctant to show distrust in Bolk6nski's em- \nphatic opinion yet not feeling able fully to \ncredit it, bent his head, and told Tushin that \nhe could go. Prince Andrew went out with him. \n\n"Thank you; you saved me, my dear fellowl" \nsaid Tushin. \n\nPrince Andrew gave him a look, but said \nnothing and went away. He felt sad and de- \npressed. It was all so strange, so unlike what \nhe had hoped. \n\n"Who are they? Why are they here? What do \nthey want? And when will all this end?" \nthought Rostc'w, looking at the changing shad- \nows before him. The pain in his arm became \nmore and more intense. Irresistible drowsiness \noverpowered him, red rings danced before his \neyes, and the impression of those voices and \nfaces and a sense of loneliness merged with the \n\n\n\nno \n\nphysical pain. It was they, these soldiers- \nwounded and unwounded it was they who \nwere crushing, weighing down, and twisting \nthe sinews and scorching the flesh of his \nsprained arm and shoulder. To rid himself of \nthem, he closed his eyes. \n\nFor a moment he dozed, but in that short in- \nterval innumerable things appeared to him in \na dream: his mother and her large white hand, \nS6nya's thin little shoulders, Natasha's eyes and \nlaughter, Denfsovwith his voice and mustache, \nand Telyaninand all that affair with Telydnin \nand Bogdnich. That affair was the same thing \nas this soldier with the harsh voice, and it was \nthat affair and this soldier that were so agoniz- \ningly, incessantly pulling and pressing his arm \nand always dragging it in one direction. He \ntried to get away from them, but they would \nnot for an instant let his shoulder move a hair's \nbreadth. It would not acheit would be well \nif only they did not pull it, but it was impossible \nto get rid of them. \n\nHe opened his eyes and looked up. The \nblack canopy of night hung less than a yard \nabove the glow of the charcoal. Flakes of fall- \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\ning snow were fluttering in that light. Tushin \nhad not returned, the doctor had not come. He \nwas alone now, except for a soldier who was \nsitting naked at the other side of the fire, warm- \ning his thin yellow body. \n\n"Nobody wants me I" thought Rostov. \n"There is no one to help me or pity me. Yet I \nwas once at home, strong, happy, and loved." \nHe sighed and, doing so, groaned involuntar- \nily. \n\n"Eh, is anything hurting you?" asked the sol- \ndier, shaking his shirt out over the fire, and not \nwaiting for an answer he gave a grunt and add- \ned: "What a lot of men have been crippled to- \nday frightful 1" \n\nRost6v did not listen to the soldier. He looked \nat the snowflakes fluttering above the fire and \nremembered a Russian winter at his warm, \nbright home, his fluffy fur coat, his quickly \ngliding sleigh, his healthy body, and all the af- \nfection and care of his family. "And why did I \ncome here?" he wondered. \n\nNext day the French army did not renew \ntheir attack, and the remnant of Bagrati6n's \ndetachment was reunited to Kutiizov's army. \n\n\n\nBook Three: 1805 \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I \n\nPRINCE VAS!LI was not a man who deliberately \nthought out his plans. Still less did he think of \ninjuring anyone for his own advantage. He was \nmerely a man of the world who had got on and \nto whom getting on had become a habit. \nSchemes and devices for which he never right- \nly accounted to himself, but which formed the \nwhole interest of his life, were constantly shap- \ning themselves in his mind, arising from the \ncircumstances and persons he met. Of these \nplans he had not merely one or two in his \nhead but dozens, some only beginning to form \nthemselves, some approaching achievement, \nand some in course of disintegration. He did \nnot, for instance, say to himself: "This man \nnow has influence, I must gain his confidence \nand friendship and through him obtain a spe- \ncial grant/' Nor did he say to himself: "Pierre \nis a rich man, I must entice him to marry my \ndaughter and lend me the forty thousand ru- \nbles I need." But when he came across a man of \nposition his instinct immediately told him that \nthis man could be useful, and without any pre- \nmeditation Prince Vasili took the first oppor- \ntunity to gain his confidence, flatter him, be- \ncome intimate with him, and finally make his \nrequest. \n\nHe had Pierre at hand in Moscow and pro- \ncured for him an appointment as Gentleman \nof the Bedchamber, which at that time con- \nferred the status of Councilor of State, and \ninsisted on the young man accompanying \nhim to Petersburg and staying at his house. \nWith apparent absent-mindedness, yet with \nunhesitating assurance that he was doing the \nright thing, Prince Vasili did everything \nto get Pierre to marry his daughter. Had he \nthought out his plans beforehand he could \nnot have been so natural and shown such un- \naffected familiarity in intercourse with every- \nbody both above and below him in social \nstanding. Something always drew him toward \nthose richer and more powerful than himself \nand he had rare skill in seizing the most op- \n\n\n\nportune moment for making use of people. \nPierre, on unexpectedly becoming Count Be- \nziikhov and a rich man, felt himself after his \nrecent loneliness and freedom from cares so be- \nset and preoccupied that only in bed was he \nable to be by himself. He had to sign papers, to \npresent himself at government offices, the pur- \npose of which was not clear to him, to question \nhis chief steward, to visit his estate near Mos- \ncow, and to receive many people who formerly \ndid not even wish to know of his existence but \nwould now have been offended and grieved \nhad he chosen not to see them. These differ- \nent people businessmen, relations, and ac- \nquaintances alike were all disposed to treat \nthe young heir in the most friendly and flatter- \ning manner: they were all evidently firmly con- \nvinced of Pierre's noble qualities. He was \nalways hearing such words as: "With your re- \nmarkable kindness," or, "With your excellent \nheart," "You are yourself so honorable, Count," \nor, "Were he as clever as you," and so on, till \nhe began sincerely to believe in his own excep- \ntional kindness and extraordinary intelligence, \nthe more so as in the depth of his heart it had \nalways seemed to him that he really was very \nkind and intelligent. Even people who had \nformerly been spiteful toward him and evident- \nly unfriendly now became gentle and affection- \nate. The angry eldest princess, with the long \nwaist and hair plastered down like a doll's, had \ncome into Pierre's room after the funeral. With \ndrooping eyes and frequent blushes she told \nhim she was very sorry about their past misun- \nderstandings and did not now feel she had a \nright to ask him for anything, except only for \npermission, after the blow she had received, to \nremain for a few weeks longer in the house \nshe so loved and where she had sacrificed so \nmuch. She could not refrain from weeping \nat these words. Touched that this statuesque \nprincess could so change, Pierre took her \nhand and begged her forgiveness, without \nknowing what for. From that day the eldest \nprincess quite changed toward Pierre and \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nbegan knitting a striped scarf for him. \n\n"Do this for my sake, mon cher; after all, she \nhad to put up with a great deal from the de- \nceased," said Prince Vasfli to him, handing him \na deed to sign for the princess' benefit. \n\nPrince Vaslli had come to the conclusion \nthat it was necessary to throw this bone a bill \nfor thirty thousand rubles to the poor prin- \ncess that it might not occur to her to speak of \nhis share in the affair of the inlaid portfolio. \nPierre signed the deed and after that the prin- \ncess grew still kinder. The younger sisters also \nbecame affectionate to him, especially the \nyoungest, the pretty one with the mole, who \noften made him feel confused by her smiles \nand her own confusion when meeting him. \n\nIt seemed so natural to Pierre that everyone \nshould like him, and it would have seemed so \nunnatural had anyone disliked him, that he \ncould not but believe in the sincerity of those \naround him. Besides, he had no time to ask \nhimself whether these people were sincere or \nnot. He was always busy and always felt in a \nstate of mild and cheerful intoxication. He \nfelt as though he were the center of some im- \nportant and general movement; that something \nwas constantly expected of him, that if he did \nnot do it he would grieve and disappoint many \npeople, but if he did this and that, all would \nbewell; and he did what was demanded of him, \nbut still that happy result always remained in \nthe future. \n\nMore than anyone else, Prince Vasfli took \npossession of Pierre's affairs and of Pierre him- \nself in those early days. From the death of \nCount Bezukhov he did not let go his hold of \nthe lad. He had the air of a man oppressed by \nbusiness, weary and suffering, who yet would \nnot, for pity's sake, leave this helpless youth \nwho, after all, was the son of his old friend and \nthe possessor of such enormous wealth, to the \ncaprice of fate and the designs of rogues. Dur- \ning the few days he spent in Moscow after the \ndeath of Count Bezukhov, he would call Pierre, \nor go to him himself, and tell him what ought \nto be done in a tone of weariness and assurance, \nas if he were adding every time: "You know I \nam overwhelmed with business and it is purely \nout of charity that I trouble myself about you, \nand you also know quite well that what I pro- \npose is the only thing possible." \n\n"Well, my dear fellow, tomorrow we are off \nat last," said Prince Vasfli one day, closing his \neyes and fingering Pierre's elbow, speaking as \nif he were saying something which had long \nsince been agreed upon and could not now be \n\n\n\naltered. "We start tomorrow and I'm giving \nyou a place in my carriage. I am very glad. All \nour important business here is now settled, and \nI ought to have been off long ago. Here is some- \nthing I have received from the chancellor. I \nasked him for you, and you have been entered \nin the diplomatic corps and made a Gentleman \nof the Bedchamber. The diplomatic career now \nlies open before you." \n\nNotwithstanding the tone of wearied assur- \nance with which these words were pronounced, \nPierre, who had so long been considering his \ncareer, wished to make some suggestion. But \nPrince Vasili interrupted him in the special \ndeep cooing tone, precluding the possibility of \ninterrupting his speech, which he used in ex- \ntreme cases when special persuasion was need- \ned. \n\n"Mais, mon cher, I did this for my own sake, \nto satisfy my conscience, and there is nothing \nto thank me for. No one has ever complained \nyet of being too much loved; and besides, you \nare free, you could throw it up tomorrow. But \nyou will see everything for yourself when you \nget to Petersburg. It is high time for you to get \naway from these terrible recollections." Prince \nVasfli sighed. "Yes, yes, my boy. And my valet \ncan go in your carriage. Ah! I was nearly for- \ngetting," he added. "You know, mon cher,your \nfather and I had some accounts to settle, so I \nhave received what was due from the Ryazan \nestate and will keep it; you won't require it. \nWe'll go into the accounts later." \n\nBy "what was due from the Ryazan estate" \nPrince Vasfli meant several thousand rubles \nquitrent received from Pierre's peasants, which \nthe prince had retained for himself. \n\nIn Petersburg, as in Moscow, Pierre found \nthe same atmosphere of gentleness and affec- \ntion. He could not refuse the post, or rather \nthe rank (for he did nothing), that Prince Va- \nsfli had procured for him, and acquaintances, \ninvitations, and social occupations were so num- \nerous that, even more than in Moscow, he felt \na sense of bewilderment, bustle, and continual \nexpectation of some good, always in front of \nhim but never attained. \n\nOf his former bachelor acquaintances many \nwere no longer in Petersburg, The Guards had \ngone to the front; D61okhov had been reduced \nto the ranks; Anatole was in the army some- \nwhere in the provinces; Prince Andrew was \nabroad; so Pierre had not the opportunity to \nspend his nights as he used to like to spend \nthem, or to open his mind by intimate talks \nwith a friend older than himself and whom he \n\n\n\nBOOK \n\nrespected. His whole time was taken up with \ndinners and balls and was spent chiefly at \nPrince Vasili's house in the company of the \nstout princess, his wife, and his beautiful daugh- \nter Hdene. \n\nLike the others, Anna Pdvlovna Sch^rer \nshowed Pierre the change of attitude toward \nhim that had taken place in society. \n\nFormerly in Anna Pdvlovna's presence, \nPierre had always felt that what he was say- \ning was out of place, tactless and unsuitable, \nthat remarks which seemed to him clever while \nthey formed in his mind became foolish as \nsoon as he uttered them, while on the contrary \nHippolyte's stupidest remarks came out clev- \ner and apt. Now everything Pierre said was \ncharmant. Even if Anna Pavlovna did not say \nso, he could see that she wished to and only \nrefrained out of regard for his modesty. \n\nIn the beginning of the winter of 1805-6 \nPierre received one of Anna Pavlovna's usual \npink notes with an invitation to which was \nadded: "You will find the beautiful Hdlcne \nhere, whom it is always delightful to see." \n\nWhen he read that sentence, Pierre felt for \nthe first time that some link which other peo- \nple recognized had grown up between himself \nand Hlne, and that thought both alarmed \nhim, as if some obligation were being imposed \non him which he could not fulfill, and pleased \nhim as an entertaining supposition. \n\nAnna Pdvlovna's "At Home" was like the for- \nmer one, only the novelty she offered her guests \nthis time was not Mortemart, but a diploma- \ntist fresh from Berlin with the very latest details \nof the Emperor Alexander's visit to Potsdam, \nand of how the two august friends had pledged \nthemselves in an indissoluble alliance to up- \nhold the cause of justice against the enemy of \nthe human race. Anna Pdvlovna received \nPierre with a shade of melancholy, evidently \nrelating to the young man's recent loss by the \ndeath of Count Bezukhov (everyone constant- \nly considered it a duty to assure Pierre that he \nwas greatly afflicted by the death of the father \nhe had hardly known), and her melancholy was \njust like the august melancholy she showed at \nthe mention of her most august Majesty the \nEmpress MdryaFedorovna. Pierre felt flattered \nby this. Anna Pdvlovna arranged the different \ngroups in her drawing room with her habitual \nskill. The large group, in which were Prince \nVasili and the generals, had the benefit of the \ndiplomat. Another group was at the tea table. \nPierre wished to join the former, but Anna Pv- \nlovna who was in the excited condition of a \n\n\n\nTHREE 113 \n\ncommander on a battlefield to whom thousands \nof new and brilliant ideas occur which there is \nhardly time to put in action seeing Pierre, \ntouched his sleeve with her finger, saying: \n\n"Wait a bit, I have something in view for you \nthis evening." (She glanced at Hdene and \nsmiled at her.) "My dear Hlne, be charitable \nto my poor aunt who adores you. Go and keep \nher company for ten minutes. And that it will \nnot be too dull, here is the dear count who will \nnot refuse to accompany you." \n\nThe beauty went to the aunt, but Anna Pav- \nlovna detained Pierre, looking as if she had to \ngive some final necessary instructions. \n\n"Isn't she exquisite?" she said to Pierre, \npointing to the stately beauty as she glided a- \nway."And how she carries herself! Forso young \na girl, such tact, such masterly perfection of \nmanner! It comes from her heart. Happy the \nman who wins her! With her the least worldly \nof men would occupy a most brilliant position \nin society. Don't you think so? I only wanted \nto know your opinion," and Anna Pdvlovna \nlet Pierre go. \n\nPierre, in reply, sincerely agreed with her as \nto Helene's perfection of manner. If he ever \nthought of H&lt;Hne,itwas just of her beauty and \nher remarkable skill in appearing silently dig- \nnified in society. \n\nThe old aunt received the two young people \nin her corner, but seemed desirous of hiding \nher adoration for Hdlene and inclined rather \nto show her fear of Anna Pdvlovna. She looked \nat her niece, as if inquiring what she was to do \nwith these people. On leaving them, Anna Pdv- \nlovna again touched Pierre's sleeve, saying: "I \nhope you won't say that it is dull in my house \nagain," and she glanced at HeUene. \n\nH^lene smiled, with a look implying that \nshe did not admit the possibility of anyone see- \ning her without being enchanted. The aunt \ncoughed, swallowed, and said in French that \nshe was very pleased to see Hlne, then she \nturned to Pierre with the same words of wel- \ncome and the same look. In the middle of a dull \nand halting conversation, Hlene turned to \nPierre with the beautiful bright smile that \nshe gave to everyone. Pierre was so used to \nthat smile, and it had so little meaning for him, \nthat he paid no attention to it. The aunt was \njust speaking of a collection of snuffboxes that \nhad belonged to Pierre's father, Count Be- \nziikhov, and showed them her own box. Prin- \ncess Hdene asked to see the portrait of the \naunt's husband on the box lid. \n\n"That is probably the work of Vinesse," said \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nPierre, mentioning a celebrated miniaturist, \nand he leaned over the table to take the snuff- \nbox while trying to hear what was being said \nat the other table. \n\nHe half rose, meaning to go round, but the \naunt handed him the snuff box, passing it across \nHlne's back. Hlene stooped forward to make \nroom, and looked round with a smile. She was, \nas always at evening parties, wearing a dress \nsuch as was then fashionable, cut very low at \nfront and back. Her bust, which had always \nseemed like marble to Pierre, was so close to \nhim that his shortsighted eyes could not but \nperceive the living charm of her neck and shoul- \nders, so near to his lips that he need only have \nbent his head a little to have touched them. He \nwas conscious of the warmth of her body, the \nscent of perfume, and the creaking of her cor- \nset as she moved. He did not see her marble \nbeauty forming a complete whole with her dress, \nbut all the charm of her body only covered by \nher garments. And having once seen this he \ncould not help being aware of it, just as we can- \nnot renew an illusion we have once seen \nthrough. \n\n"So you have never noticed before how beau- \ntiful I am?" Hlene seemed to say. "You had not \nnoticed that I am a woman? Yes, I am a wom- \nan who may belong to anyone to you too," \nsaid her glance. And at that moment Pierre \nfelt that Hdene not only could, but must, be \nhis wife, and that it could not be otherwise. \n\nHe knew this at that moment as surely as if \nhe had been standing at the altar with her. \nHow and when this would be he did not know, \nhe did not even know if it would be a good \nthing (he even felt, he knew not why, that it \nwould be a bad thing), but he knew it would \nhappen. \n\nPierre dropped his eyes, lifted them again, \nand wished once more to see her as a distant \nbeauty far removed from him, as he had seen \nher every day.until then, but he could no long- \ner do it. He could not, any more than a man \nwho has been looking at a tuft of steppe grass \nthrough the mist and taking it for a tree can \nagain take it for a tree after he has once recog- \nnized it to be a tuft of grass. She was terribly \nclose to him. She already had power over him, \nand between them there was no longer any \nbarrier except the barrier of his own will. \n\n"Well, I will leave you in your little corner," \ncame Anna Pdvlovna's voice, "I see you are \nall right there." \n\nAnd Pierre, anxiously trying to remember \nwhether he had done anything reprehensible, \n\n\n\nlooked round with a blush. It seemed to him \nthat everyone knew what had happened to him \nas he knew it himself. \n\nA little later when he went up to the large \ncircle, Anna Pdvlovna said to him: "I hear you \nare refitting your Petersburg house?" \n\nThis was true. The architect had told him \nthat it was necessary, and Pierre, without know- \ning why, was having his enormous Petersburg \nhouse done up. \n\n"That's a good thing, but don't move from \nPrince Vasfli's. It is good to have a friend like \nthe prince," she said, smiling at Prince Vastti. \n"I know something about that. Don't I? And \nyou are still so young. You need advice. Don't \nbe angry with me for exercising an old woman's \nprivilege." \n\nShe paused, as women always do, expecting \nsomething after they have mentioned their age. \n"If you marry it will be a different thing," she \ncontinued, uniting them both in one glance. \nPierre did not look at Hdlene nor she at him. \nBut she was just as terribly close to him. He \nmuttered something and colored. \n\nWhen he got home he could not sleep for a \nlong time for thinking of what had happened. \nWhat had happened? Nothing. He had merely \nunderstood that the woman he had known as a \nchild, of whom when her beauty was mentioned \nhe had said absent-mindedly: "Yes, she's good- \nlooking," he had understood that this woman \nmight belong to him. \n\n"But she's stupid. I have myself said she is \nstupid," he thought. "There is something nas- \nty, something wrong, in the feeling she excites \nin me. I have been told that her brother Ana- \ntole was in love with her and she with him, \nthat there was quite a scandal and that that's \nwhy he was sent away. Hippolyte is her \nbrother . . . Prince Vastti is her father . . . It's \nbad " he reflected, but while he was think- \ning this (the reflection was still incomplete), he \ncaught himself smiling and was conscious that \nanother line of thought had sprung up, and \nwhile thinking of her worthlessness he was also \ndreaming of how she would be his wife, how \nshe would love him and become quite different, \nand how all he had thought and heard of her \nmight be false. And he again saw her not as the \ndaughter of Prince Vasfli, but visualized her \nwhole body only veiled by its gray dress. "But \nno I Why did this thought never occur to me \nbefore?" and again he told himself that it was \nimpossible, that there would be something un- \nnatural, and as it seemed to him dishonorable, \nin this marriage. He recalled her former words \n\n\n\nBOOK THREE \n\n\n\nand looks and the words and looks of those who \nhad seen them together. He recalled Anna Pdv- \nlovna's words and looks when she spoke to him \nabout his house, recalled thousands of such \nhints from Prince Vasili and others, and was \nseized by terror lest he had already, in some \nway, bound himself to do something that was \nevidently wrong and that he ought not to do. \nBut at the very time he was expressing this con- \nviction to himself, in another part of his mind \nher image rose in all its womanly beauty. \n\nCHAPTER II \n\nIN NOVEMBER, 1805, Prince Vasfli had to go on \na tour of inspection in four different provinces. \nHe had arranged this for himself so as to visit \nhis neglected estates at the same time and pick \nup his son Anatole where his regiment was sta- \ntioned, and take him to visit Prince Nicholas \nBolk6nski in order to arrange a match for him \nwith the daughter of that rich old man. But be- \nfore leaving home and undertaking these new \naffairs, Prince Vasili had to settle matters with \nPierre, who, it is true, had latterly spent whole \ndays at home, that is, in Prince Vasfli's house \nwhere he was staying, and had been absurd, ex- \ncited, and foolish in He*lene's presence (as a \nlover should be), but had not yet proposed to \nher. \n\n"This is all very fine, but things must be set- \ntled," said Prince Vasili to himself, with a sor- \nrowful sigh, one morning, feeling that Pierre \nwho was under such obligations to him ("But \nnever mind that") was not behaving very well \nin this matter. "Youth, frivolity . . . well, God \nbe with him," thought he, relishing his own \ngoodness of heart, "but it must be brought to \na head. The day after tomorrow will be Lelya's \nname day. I will invite two or three people, \nand if he does not understand what he ought \nto do then it will be my affair yes, my affair. I \nam her father." \n\nSix weeks after Anna Pavlovna's "At Home" \nand after the sleepless night when he had de- \ncided that to marry He*lene would be a calam- \nity and that he ought to avoid her and go away, \nPierre, despite that decision, had not left Prince \nVasili's and felt with terror that in people's \neyes he was every day more and more connected \nwith her, that it was impossible for him to re- \nturn to his former conception of her, that he \ncould not break away from her, and that though \nit would be a terrible thing he would have to \nunite his fate with hers. He might perhaps have \nbeen able to free himself but that Prince Vasili \n(who had rarely before given receptions) now \n\n\n\nhardly let a day go by without having an even- \ning party at which Pierre had to be present un- \nless he wished to spoil the general pleasure and \ndisappoint everyone's expectation. Prince Va- \nsili, in the rare moments when he was at home, \nwould take Pierre's hand in passing and draw \nit downwards, or absent-mindedly hold out \nhis wrinkled, clean-shaven cheek for Pierre to \nkiss and would say: "Till tomorrow," or, "Be \nin to dinner or I shall not see you," or, "I am \nstaying in for your sake," and so on. And though \nPrince Vasili, when he stayed in (as he said) for \nPierre's sake, hardly exchanged a couple of \nwords with him, Pierre felt unable to disap- \npoint him. Every day he said to himself one and \nthe same thing: "It is time I understood her \nand made up my mind what she really is. Was \n1 mistaken before, or am I mistaken now? No, \nshe is not stupid, she is an excellent girl," he \nsometimes said to himself, "she never makes a \nmistake, never says anything stupid. She says \nlittle, but what she does say is always clear and \nsimple, so she is not stupid. She never was \nabashed and is not abashed now, so she cannot \nbe a bad woman!" He had of ten begun to make \nreflections or think aloud in her company, and \nshe had always answered him either by a brief \nbut appropriate remark showing that it did \nnot interest her or by a silent look and smile \nwhich more palpably than anything else showed \nPierre her superiority. She was right in regard- \ning all arguments as nonsense in comparison \nwith that smile. \n\nShe always addressed him with a radiantly \nconfiding smile meant for him alone, in which \nthere was something more significant than in \nthe general smile that usually brightened her \nface. Pierre knew that everyone was waiting for \nhim to say a word and cross a certain line, and \nhe knew that sooner or later he would step \nacross it, but an incomprehensible terror seized \nhim at the thought of that dreadful step. A \nthousand times during that month and a half \nwhile he felt himself drawn nearer and nearer \nto that dreadful abyss, Pierre said to himself: \n"What am I doing? I need resolution. Can it \nbe that I have none?" \n\nHe wished to take a decision, but felt with \ndismay that in this matter he lacked that \nstrength of will which he had known in him- \nself and really possessed. Pierre was one of \nthose who are only strong when they feel \nthemselves quite innocent, and since that day \nwhen he was overpowered by a feeling of de- \nsire while stooping over the snuffbox at Anna \nPavlovna's, an unacknowledged sense of the \n\n\n\nn6 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nguilt of that desire paralyzed his will. \n\nOn Hlne's name day, a small party of just \ntheir own people as his wife said met for sup- \nper at Prince Vasili's. All these friends and re- \nlations had been given to understand that the \nfate of the young girl would be decided that \nevening. The visitors were seated at supper. \nPrincess Kuragina, a portly imposing woman \nwho had once been handsome, was sitting at \nthe head of the table. On either side of her sat \nthe more important guests an old general and \nhis wife, and Anna Pdvlovna Schdrer. At the \nother end sat the younger and less important \nguests, and there too sat the members of the \nfamily, and Pierre and Hlne, side by side. \nPrince Vasili was not having any supper: he \nwent round the table in a merry mood, sitting \ndown now by one, now by another, of the \nguests. To each of them he made some careless \nand agreeable remark except to Pierre and He*I- \nne, whose presence he seemed not to notice. \nHe enlivened the whole party. The wax can- \ndles burned brightly, the silver and crystal \ngleamed, so did the ladies' toilets and the gold \nand silver of the men's epaulets; servants in scar- \nlet liveries moved round the table, and the clat- \nter of plates, knives, and glasses mingled with \nthe animated hum of several conversations. At \none end of the table, the old chamberlain was \nheard assuring an old baroness that he loved \nher passionately, at which she laughed; at the \nother could be heard the story of the misfor- \ntunes of some Mary Viktorovna or other. At \nthe center of the table, Prince Vasili attracted \neverybody's attention. With a facetious smile \non his face, he was telling the ladies about last \nWednesday's meeting of the Imperial Council, \nat which Sergey Kuzmich Vyazmftinov, the new \nmilitary governor general of Petersburg, had \nreceived and read the then famous rescript of \nthe Emperor Alexander from the army to Ser- \nge'y Kuzmich, in which the Emperor said that \nhe was receiving from all sides declarations of \nthe people's loyalty, that the declaration from \nPetersburg gave him particular pleasure, and \nthat he was proud to be at the head of such a \nnation and would endeavor to be worthy of it. \nThis rescript began with the words: "Serge'y \nKuzmich, From all sides reports reach me," etc. \n\n"Well, and so he never got farther than: \n'Serge'y Kuzmich'?" asked one of the ladies. \n\n"Exactly, not a hair's breadth farther," an- \nswered Prince Vasili, laughing, " 'Serge'y Kuz- \nmich . . . From all sides . . . From all sides . . . \nSerge'y Kuzmich . . .' Poor Vyazmitinov could \nnot get any farther. He began the rescript again \n\n\n\nand again, but as soon as he uttered 'Serge'y 9 he \nsobbed, 'Kuz-mi-ch' tears, and 'From all sides' \nwas smothered in sobs and he could get no far- \nther. And again his handkerchief, and again: \n'Sergey Kuzmich, From all sides' . . . and tears, \ntill at last somebody else was asked to read it." \n\n"Kuzmich . . . From all sides . . . and then \ntears," someone repeated laughing. \n\n"Don't be unkind," cried Anna Pdvlovna \nfrom her end of the table holding up a threat- \nening finger. "He is such a worthy and excellent \nman, our dear Vyazmitinov " \n\nEverybody laughed a great deal. At the head \nof the table, where the honored guests sat, ev- \neryone seemed to be in high spirits and under \nthe influence of a variety of exciting sensations. \nOnly Pierre and Hellene sat silently side by \nside almost at the bottom of the table, a sup- \npressed smile brightening both their faces, a \nsmile that had nothing to do with Sergey Kuz- \nmfch a smile of bashfulness at their own feel- \nings. But much as all the rest laughed, talked, \nand joked, much as they enjoyed their Rhine \nwine, saute, and ices, and however they avoid- \ned looking at the young couple, and heedless \nand unobservant as they seemed of them, \none could feel by the occasional glances they \ngave that the story about Sergey Kuzmfch, the \nlaughter, and the food were all a pretense, and \nthat the whole attention of that company was \ndirected to Pierre and Hlne. Prince Vasili \nmimicked the sobbing of Serge'y Kuzmfch and \nat the same time his eyes glanced toward his \ndaughter, and while he laughed the expression \non his face clearly said: "Yes . . . it's getting on, \nit will all be settled today." Anna Pdvlovna \nthreatened him on behalf of "our dear Vyaz- \nmitinov," and in her eyes, which, for an in- \nstant, glanced at Pierre, Prince Vasfli read a \ncongratulation on his future son-in-law and on \nhis daughter's happiness. The old princess \nsighed sadly as she offered some wine to the \nold lady next to her and glanced angrily at her \ndaughter, and her sigh seemed to say: "Yes, \nthere's nothing left for you and me but to sip \nsweet wine, my dear, now that the time has \ncome for these young ones to be thus boldly, \nprovocatively happy." "And what nonsense all \nthis is that I am saying!" thought a diploma- \ntist, glancing at the happy faces of the lovers. \n"That's happiness!" \n\nInto the insignificant, trifling, and artificial \ninterests uniting that society had entered the \nsimple feeling of the attraction of a healthy \nand handsome young man and woman for one \nanother. And this human feeling dominated \n\n\n\nBOOK \n\neverything else and soared above all their af- \nfected chatter. Jests fell flat, news was not in- \nteresting, and the animation was evidently \nforced. Not only the guests but even the foot- \nmen waiting at table seemed to feel this, and \nthey forgot their duties as they looked at the \nbeautiful He"lene with her radiant face and at \nthe red, broad, and happy though uneasy face \nof Pierre. It seemed as if the very light of the \ncandles was focused on those two happy faces \nalone. \n\nPierre felt that he was the center of it all, and \nthis both pleased and embarrassed him. He was \nlike a man entirely absorbed in some occupa- \ntion. He did not see, hear, or understand any- \nthing clearly. Only now and then detached \nideas and impressions from the world of reality \nshot unexpectedly through his mind. \n\n"So it is all finished!" he thought. "And how \nhas it all happened? How quickly 1 Now I know \nthat not because of her alone, nor of myself \nalone, but because of everyone, it must inevi- \ntably come about. They are all expecting it, \nthey are so sure that it will happen that I can- \nnot, I cannot, disappoint them. But how will it \nbe? I do not know, but it will certainly happen!" \nthought Pierre, glancingat those dazzlingshoul- \nders close to his eyes. \n\nOr he would suddenly feel ashamed of he \nknew not what. He felt it awkward to attract \neveryone's attention and to be considered a \nlucky man and, with his plain face, to be looked \non as a sort of Paris possessed of a Helen. "But \nno doubt it always is and must be so!" he con- \nsoled himself. "And besides, what have I done \nto bring it about? How did it begin? I traveled \nfrom Moscow with Prince Vasfli. Then there \nwas nothing. So why should I not stay at his \nhouse? Then I played cards with her and picked \nup her reticule and drove out with her. How \ndid it begin, when did it all come about?" And \nhere he was sitting by her side as her betrothed, \nseeing, hearing, feel ing her nearness, her breath- \ning, her movements, her beauty. Then it \nwould suddenly seem to him that it was not \nshe but he who was so unusually beautiful, and \nthat that was why they all looked so at him, \nand flattered by this general admiration he \nwould expand his chest, raise his head, and re- \njoice at his good fortune. Suddenly he heard \na familiar voice repeating something to him a \nsecond time. But Pierre was so absorbed that \nhe did not understand what was said. \n\n"I am asking you when you last heard from \nBolk6nski," repeated Prince Vasfli a third time. \n"How absent-minded you are, my dear fellow." \n\n\n\nTHREE 117 \n\nPrince Vastti smiled, and Pierre noticed that \neveryone was smiling at him and He"lene. \n"Well, what of it, if you all know it?" thought \nPierre. "What of it? It's the truth!" and he him- \nself smiled his gentle childlike smile, and He*l- \nene smiled too. \n\n"When did you get the letter? Was it from \nOlmiitz?" repeated Prince Vasfli, who pretend- \ned to want to know this in order to settle a \ndispute. \n\n"How can one talk or think of such trifles?" \nthought Pierre. \n\n"Yes, from Olmiitz," he answered, with a \nsigh. \n\nAfter supper Pierre with his partner fol- \nlowed the others into the drawing room. The \nguests began to disperse, some without taking \nleave of Hlne. Some, as if unwilling to dis- \ntract her from an important occupation, came \nup to her for a moment and made haste to go \naway, refusing to let her see them off. The di- \nplomatist preserved a mournful silence as he \nleft the drawing room. He pictured the vanity \nof his diplomatic career in comparison with \nPierre's happiness. The old general grumbled \nat his wife when she asked how his leg was. \n"Oh, the old fool," he thought. "That Princess \nHlene will be beautiful still when she's fifty." \n\n"I think I may congratulate you," whispered \nAnna Pdvlovna to the old princess, kissing her \nsoundly. "If I hadn't this headache I'd have \nstayed longer." \n\nThe old princess did not reply, she was tor- \nmented by jealousy of her daughter's happiness. \n\nWhile the guests were taking their leave, \nPierre remained for a long time alone with \nHelene in the little drawing room where \nthey were sitting. He had often before, during \nthe last six weeks, remained alone with her, \nbut had never spoken to her of love. Now he \nfelt that it was inevitable, but he could not \nmake up his mind to take the final step. He \nfelt ashamed; he felt that he was occupying \nsomeone else's place here beside Hlne. "This \nhappiness is not for you," some inner voice \nwhispered to him. "This happiness is for those \nwho have not in them what there is in you." \n\nBut, as he had to say something, he began by \nasking her whether she was satisfied with the \nparty. She replied in her usual simple manner \nthat this name day of hers had been one of the \npleasantest she had ever had. \n\nSome of the nearest relatives had not yet left. \nThey were sitting in the large drawing room. \nPrince Vasfli came up to Pierre with languid \nfootsteps. Pierre rose and said it was getting \n\n\n\nn8 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nlate. Prince Vasfli gave him a look of stern in- \nquiry, as though what Pierre had just said was \nso strange that one could not take it in. But \nthen the expression of severity changed, and \nhe drew Pierre's hand downwards, made him \nsit down, and smiled affectionately. \n\n"Well, Lelya?" he asked, turning instantly \nto his daughter and addressing her with the \ncareless tone of habitual tenderness natural to \nparents who have petted their children from \nbabyhood, but which Prince Vasili had only \nacquired by imitating other parents. \n\nAnd he again turned to Pierre. \n\n"Serge*y Kuzmfch From all sides" he said, \nunbuttoning the top button of his waistcoat. \n\nPierre smiled, but his smile showed that he \nknew it was not the story about Serge*y Kuz- \nmfch that interested Prince Vasfli just then, \nand Prince Vasili saw that Pierre knew this. \nHe suddenly muttered something and went \naway. It seemed to Pierre that even the prince \nwas disconcerted. The sight of the discompo- \nsure of that old man of the world touched \nPierre: he looked at Hlene and she too \nseemed disconcerted, and her look seemed to \nsay: "Well, it is your own fault." \n\n"The step must be taken but I cannot, I can- \nnot! "thought Pierre, and he again began speak- \ning about indifferent matters, about Sergey \nKuzmfch, asking what the point of the story \nwas as he had not heard it properly. Hellene \nanswered with a smile that she too had missed \nit. \n\nWhen Prince Vasfli returned to the drawing \nroom, the princess, his wife, was talking in \nlow tones to the elderly lady about Pierre. \n\n"Of course, it is a very brilliant match, but \nhappiness, my dear . . ." \n\n"Marriages are made in heaven," replied the \nelderly lady. \n\nPrince Vasili passed by, seeming not to hear \nthe ladies, and sat down on a sofa in a far cor- \nner of the room. He closed his eyes and seemed \nto be dozing. His head sank forward and then \nhe roused himself. \n\n"Aline," he said to his wife, "go and see what \nthey are about." \n\nThe princess went up to the door, passed by \nit with a dignified and indifferent air, and \nglanced into the little drawing room. Pierre \nand H&amp;ene still sat talking just as before. \n\n"Still the same," she said to her husband. \n\nPrince Vasili frowned, twisting his mouth, \nhis cheeks quivered and his face assumed the \ncoarse, unpleasant expression peculiar to him. \nShaking himself, he rose, threw back his head, \n\n\n\nand with resolute steps went past the ladies in- \nto the little drawing room. With quick steps he \nwent joyfully up to Pierre. His face was so un- \nusually triumphant that Pierre rose in alarm \non seeing it. \n\n"Thank God!" said Prince Vasfli. "My wife \nhas told me everything!" (He put one arm \naround Pierre and the other around his daugh- \nter.) "My dear boy . . . Lelya ... I am very \npleased." (His voice trembled.) "I loved your \nfather . . . and she will make you a good wife \n. . . God bless you! . . ." \n\nHe embraced his daughter, and then again \nPierre, and kissed him with his malodorous \nmouth. Tears actually moistened his cheeks. \n\n"Princess, come here!" he shouted. \n\nThe old princess came in and also wept. The \nelderly lady was using her handkerchief too. \nPierre was kissed, and he kissed the beautiful \nHdlne's hand several times. After a while they \nwere left alone again. \n\n"All this had to be and could not be other- \nwise," thought Pierre, "so it is useless to ask \nwhether it is good or bad. It is good because \nit's definite and one is rid of the old torment- \ning doubt." Pierre held the hand of his be- \ntrothed in silence, looking at her beautiful bos- \nom as it rose and fell. \n\n"He*lene!" he said aloud and paused. \n\n"Something special is always said in such \ncases," he thought, but could not remember \nwhat it was that people say. He looked at her \nface. She drew nearer to him. Her face flushed. \n\n"Oh, take those off ... those . . ." she said, \npointing to his spectacles. \n\nPierre took them off, and his eyes, besides \nthe strange look eyes have from which spec- \ntacles have just been removed, had also a fright- \nened arid inquiring look. He was about tostoop \nover her hand and kiss it, but with a rapid, al- \nmost brutal movement of her head, she inter- \ncepted his lips and met them with her own. \nHer face struck Pierre, by its altered, unpleas- \nantly excited expression. \n\n"It is too late now, it's done; besides I love \nher," thought Pierre. \n\n"Je vous aime!" * he said, remembering what \nhas to be said at such moments: but his words \nsounded so weak that he felt ashamed of him- \nself. \n\nSix weeks later he was married, and settled \nin Count Beziikhov's large, newly furnished Pe- \ntersburg house, the happy possessor, as people \nsaid, of a wife who was a celebrated beauty and \nof millions of money. \n\n1 "I love you." \n\n\n\nBOOK \n\nCHAPTER III \n\nOLD PRINCE NICHOLAS BOLK/^NSKI received a \nletter from Prince Vasili in November, 1805, \nannouncing that he and his son would be pay- \ning him a visit. "I am starting on a journey of \ninspection, and of course I shall think nothing \nof an extra seventy miles to come and see you \nat the same time, my honored benefactor," \nwrote Prince Vasili. "My son Anatole is accom- \npanying me on his way to the army, so I hope \nyou will allow him personally to express the \ndeep respect that, emulating his father, he feels \nfor you." \n\n"It seems that there will be no need to bring \nMary out, suitors are coming to us of their own \naccord," incautiously remarked the little prin- \ncess on hearing the news. \n\nPrince Nicholas frowned, but said nothing. \n\nA fortnight after the letter Prince Vasili's \nservants came one evening in advance of him, \nand he and his son arrived next day. \n\nOld Bolk6nski had always had a poor opin- \nion of Prince Vasfli's character, but more so \nrecently, since in the new reigns of Paul arid \nAlexander Prince Vasili had risen to high po- \nsition and honors. And now, from the hints \ncontained in his letter and given by the little \nprincess, he saw which way the wind was blow- \ning, and his low opinion changed intoa feeling \nof contemptuous ill will. He snorted whenev- \ner he mentioned him. On the day of Prince Va- \nsili's arrival, Prince Bolkonski was particularly \ndiscontented and out of temper. Whether he \nwas in a bad temper because Prince Vasili was \ncoming, or whether his being in a bad temper \nmade him specially annoyed at Prince Vasili's \nvisit, he was in a bad temper, and in the morn- \ning Tfkhon had already advised the architect \nnot to go the prince with his report. \n\n"Do you hear how he's walking?" said Tfk- \nhon, drawing the architect's attention to the \nsound of the prince's footsteps. "Stepping flat \non his heels we know what that means " \n\nHowever, at nine o'clock the prince, in his \nvelvet coat with a sable collar and cap, went \nout for his usual walk. It had snowed the day \nbefore and the path to the hothouse, along \nwhich the prince was in the habit of walking, \nhad been swept: the marks of the broom were \nstill visible in the snow and a shovel had been \nleft sticking in one of the soft snowbanks that \nbordered both sides of the path. The prince \nwent through the conservatories, the serfs' \nquarters, and the outbuildings, frowning and \nsilent. \n\n"Can a sleigh pass?" he asked his overseer, a \n\n\n\nTHREE 119 \n\nvenerable man, resembling his master in man- \nners and looks, who was accompanying him \nback to the house. \n\n"The snow is deep. I am having the avenue \nswept, your honor." \n\nThe prince bowed his head and went up to \nthe porch. "God be thanked," thought the \noverseer, "the storm has blown over!" \n\n"It would have been hard to drive up, your \nhonor," he added. "I heard, your honor, that \na minister is coming to visit your honor." \n\nThe prince turned round to the overseer \nand fixed his eyes on him, frowning. \n\n"What? A minister? What minister? Who \ngave orders?" he said in his shrill, harsh voice. \n"The road is not swept for the princess my \ndaughter, but for a minister! For me, there are \nno ministers!" \n\n"Your honor, I thought . . ." \n\n"You thought!" shouted the prince, his \nwords coming more and more rapidly and in- \ndistinctly. "You thoughtl . . . Rascals! Black- \nguards! . . . I'll teach you to think!" and lifting \nhis stick he swung it and would have hit Al- \npitych, the overseer, had not the latter instinc- \ntively avoided the blow. "Thought . . . Black- \nguards . . ." shouted the prince rapidly. \n\nBut although Alpdtych, frightened at his own \ntemerity in avoiding the stroke, came up to the \nprince, bowing his bald head resignedly before \nhim, or perhaps for that very reason, the prince, \nthough he continued to shout: "Blackguards! \n. . . Throw the snow back on the road!" did not \nlift his stick again but hurried into the house. \n\nBefore dinner, Princess Mary and Mademoi- \nselle Bourienne, who knew that the prince was \nin a bad humor, stood awaiting him; Mademoi- \nselle Bourienne with a radiant face that said: \n"I know nothing, I am the same as usual," and \nPrincess Mary, pale, frightened, and with down- \ncast eyes. What she found hardest to bear was \nto know that on such occasions she ought to be- \nhave like Mademoiselle Bourienne, but could \nnot. She thought: "If I seem not to notice he \nwill think that I do not sympathize with him; if \nI seem sad and out of spirits myself, he will say \n(as he has done before) that I'm in thedumps." \n\nThe prince looked at his daughter's fright- \nened face and snorted. \n\n"Fool ... or dummy!" he muttered. \n\n"And the other one is not here. They've been \ntelling tales," he thoughtreferring to the lit- \ntle princess who was not in the dining room. \n\n"Where is the princess?" he asked. "Hiding?" \n\n"She is not very well," answered Mademoi- \nselle Bourienne with a bright smile, "so she \n\n\n\nISO \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nwon't come down. It is natural in her state." \n\n"Hm! Hml" muttered the prince, sitting \ndown. \n\nHis plate seemed to him not quite dean, and \npointing to a spot he flung it away. Tikhon \ncaught it and handed it to a footman. The lit- \ntle princess was not unwell, but had such an \noverpowering fear of the prince that, hearing \nhe was in a bad humor, she had decided not to \nappear. \n\n"I am afraid for the baby," she said to Made- \nmoiselle Bourienne: "Heaven knows what a \nfright might do." \n\nIn general at Bald Hills the little princess \nlived in constant fear, and with a sense of an- \ntipathy to the old prince which she did not re- \nalize because the fear was so much the strong- \ner feeling. The prince reciprocated this antip- \nathy, but it was overpowered by his contempt \nfor her. When the little princess had grown \naccustomed to life at Bald Hills, she took a \nspecial fancy to Mademoiselle Bourienne, \nspent whole days with her, asked her to sleep in \nher room, and often talked with her about the \nold prince and criticized him. \n\n"So we are to have visitors, mon prince?" re- \nmarked Mademoiselle Bourienne, unfolding \nher white napkin with her rosy fingers. "His \nExcellency Prince Vasili Kurdgin and his son, \nI understand?" she said inquiringly. \n\n"Hml his excellency is a puppy. ... I got \nhim his appointment in the service," said the \nprince disdainfully. "Why his son is coming I \ndon't understand. Perhaps Princess Elizabeth \nand Princess Mary know. I don't want him." \n(He looked at his blushing daughter.) "Are \nyou unwell today? Eh? Afraid of the 'minister' \nas that idiot Alpdtych called him this morn- \ning?" \n\n"No, mon pkre" \n\nThough Mademoiselle Bourienne had been \nso unsuccessful in her choice of a subject, she \ndid not stop talking, but chattered about the \nconservatories and the beauty of a flower that \nhad just opened, and after the soup the prince \nbecame more genial. \n\nAfter dinner, he went to see his daughter-in- \nlaw. The little princess was sitting at a small \ntable, chattering with Msha, her maid. She \ngrew pale on seeing her father-in-law. \n\nShe was much altered. She was now plain \nrather than pretty. Her cheeks had sunk, her \nlip was drawn up, and her eyes drawn down. \n\n"Yes, I feel a kind of oppression/' she said \nin reply to the prince's question as to how she \nfelt \n\n\n\n"Do you want anything?" \n\n"No, merci, mon ptre." \n\n"Well, all right, all right." \n\nHe left the room and went to the waiting \nroom where Alpdtych stood with bowed head. \n\n"Has the snow been shoveled back?" \n\n"Yes, your excellency. Forgive me for heav- \nen's sake ... It was only my stupidity." \n\n"All right, all right," interrupted the prince, \nand laughing in his unnatural way, he stretched \nout his hand for Alpdtych to kiss, and then pro- \nceeded to his study. \n\nPrince Vasili arrived that evening. He was \nmet in the avenue by coachmen and footmen, \nwho, with loud shouts, dragged his sleighs up \nto one of the lodges over the road purposely \nladen with snow. \n\nPrince Vastti and Anatole had separate rooms \nassigned to them. \n\nAnatole, having taken off his overcoat, sat \nwith arms akimbo before a table on a corner of \nwhich he smilingly and absent-mindedly fixed \nhis large and handsome eyes. He regarded his \nwhole life as a continual round of amusement \nwhich someone for some reason had to provide \nfor him. And he looked on this visit to a churl- \nish old man and a rich and ugly heiress in the \nsame way. All this might, he thought, turn out \nvery well and amusingly. "And why not marry \nher if she really has so much money? That nev- \ner does any harm," thought Anatole. \n\nHe shaved and scented himself with the care \nand elegance which had become habitual to \nhim and, his handsome head held high, entered \nhis father's room with the good-humored and \nvictorious air natural to him. Prince Vasili's \ntwo valets were busy dressing him, and he \nlooked round with much animation and cheer- \nfully nodded to his son as the latter entered, as \nif to say: "Yes, that's how I want you to look." \n\n"I say, Father, joking apart, is she very hid- \neous?" Anatole asked, as if continuing a con- \nversation the subject of which had often been \nmentioned during the journey. \n\n"Enough! What nonsensel Above all, try to \nbe respectful and cautious with the old prince." \n\n"If he starts a row I'll go away," said Prince \nAnatole. "I can't bear those old men! Eh?" \n\n"Remember, for you everything depends on \nthis." \n\nIn the meantime, not only was it known in \nthe maidservants' rooms that the minister and \nhis son had arrived, but the appearance of both \nhad been minutely described. Princess Mary, \nwas sitting alone in her room, vainly trying to \nmaster her agitation. \n\n\n\nBOOK THREE \n\n\n\n"Why did they write, why did Lise tell me \nabout it? It can never happen!" she said, look- \ning at herself in the glass. "Howshall I enter the \ndrawing room? Even if I like him I can't now \nbe myself with him." The mere thought of her \nfather's look filled her with terror. The little \nprincess and Mademoiselle Bourienne had al- \nready received from Mdsha, the lady's maid, \nthe necessary report of how handsome the min- \nister's son was, with his rosy cheeks and dark \neyebrows, and with what difficulty the father \nhad dragged his legs upstairs while the son had \nfollowed him like an eagle, three steps at a time. \nHaving received this information, the little \nprincess and Mademoiselle Bourienne, whose \nchattering voices had reached her from the cor- \nridor, went into Princess Mary's room. \n\n"You know they've come, Marie?" said the \nlittle princess, waddling in, and sinking heav- \nily into an armchair. \n\nShe was no longer in the loose gown she gen- \nerally wore in the morning, but had on one of \nher best dresses. Her hair was carefully done \nand her face was animated, which, however, \ndid not conceal its sunken and faded outlines. \nDressed as she used to be in Petersburg society, \nit was still more noticeable how much plainer \nshe had become. Some unobtrusive touch had \nbeen added to Mademoiselle Bourienne's toi- \nlet which rendered her fresh and pretty face yet \nmore attractive. \n\n"What! Are you going to remain as you are, \ndear princess?" she began. "They'll be an- \nnouncing that the gentlemen are in the draw- \ning room and we shall have to go down, and \nyou have not smartened yourself up at all!" \n\nThe little princess got up, rang for the maid, \nand hurriedly and merrily began to devise and \ncarry out a plan of how Princess Mary should \nbe dressed. Princess Mary's self-esteem was \nwounded by the fact that the arrival of a suitor \nagitated her, and still more so by both her com- \npanions' not having the least conception that \nit could be otherwise. To tell them that she felt \nashamed for herself and for them would be to \nbetray her agitation, while to decline their of- \nfers to dress her would prolong their banter \nand insistence. She flushed, her beautiful eyes \ngrew dim, red blotches came on her face, and it \ntook on the unattractive martyrlike expression \nit so often wore, as she submitted herself to \nMademoiselle Bourienne and Lise. Both these \nwomen quite sincerely tried to make her look \npretty. She was so plain that neither of them \ncould think of her as a rival, so they began \ndressing her with perfect sincerity, and with \n\n\n\n121 \n\nthe naive and firm conviction women have \nthat dress can make a face pretty. \n\n"No really, my dear, this dress is not pretty," \nsaid Lise, looking sideways at Princess Mary \nfrom a little distance. "You have a maroon \ndress, have it fetched. Really! You know the \nfate of your whole life may be at stake. But this \none is too light, it's not becoming!" \n\nIt was not the dress, but the face and whole \nfigure of Princess Mary that was not pretty, \nbut neither Mademoiselle Bourienne nor the \nlittle princess felt this; they still thought that \nif a blue ribbon were placed in the hair, the \nhair combed up, and the blue scarf arranged \nlower on the best maroon dress, and so on, all \nwould be well. They forgot that the frightened \nface and the figure could not be altered, and \nthat however they might change the setting and \nadornment of that face, it would still remain \npiteous and plain. After two or three changes \nto which Princess Mary meekly submitted, just \nas her hair had been arranged on the top of \nher head (a style that quite altered and spoiled \nher looks) and she had put on a maroon dress \nwith a pale-blue scarf, the little princess walked \ntwice round her, now adjusting a fold of the \ndress with her little hand, now arranging the \nscarf and looking at her with her head bent \nfirst on one side and then on the other. \n\n"No, it will not do," she said decidedly, clasp- \ning her hands. "No, Mary, really this dress does \nnot suit you. I prefer you in your little gray \neveryday dress. Now please, do it for my sake. \nKatie," she said to the maid, "bring the prin- \ncess her gray dress, and you'll see, Mademoi- \nselle Bourienne, how I shall arrange it," she \nadded,smilingwith a foretaste of artistic pleas- \nure. \n\nBut when Katie brought the required dress, \nPrincess Mary remained sitting motionless be- \nfore the glass, looking at her face, and saw in \nthe mirror her eyes full of tears and her mouth \nquivering, ready to burst into sobs. \n\n"Come, dear princess," said Mademoiselle \nBourienne, "just one more little effort." \n\nThe little princess, taking the dress from the \nmaid, came up to Princess Mary. \n\n"Well, now we'll arrange something quite \nsimple and becoming," she said. \n\nThe three voices, hers, Mademoiselle Bouri- \nenne's, and Katie's, who was laughing at some- \nthing, mingled in a merry sound, like the chirp- \ning of birds. \n\n"No, leave me alone," said Princess Mary. \n\nHer voice sounded so serious and so sad that \nthe chirping of the birds was silenced at once. \n\n\n\n122 \n\nThey looked at the beautiful, large, thought- \nful eyes full of tears and of thoughts, gazing \nshiningly and imploringly at them, and under- \nstood that it was useless and even cruel to in- \nsist. \n\n"At least, change your coiffure," said the lit- \ntle princess. "Didn't I tell you," she went on, \nturning reproachfully to Mademoiselle Bouri- \nenne, "Mary's is a face which such a coiffure \ndoes not suit in the least. Not in the least! \nPlease change it." \n\n"Leave me alone, please leave me alone! It \nis all quite the same to me," answered a voice \nstruggling with tears. \n\nMademoiselle Bourienne and the little prin- \ncess had to own to themselves that Princess \nMary in this guise looked very plain, worse \nthan usual, but it was too late. She was looking \nat them with an expression they both knew, an \nexpression thoughtful and sad. This expres- \nsion in Princess Mary did not frighten them \n(she never inspired fear in anyone), but they \nknew that when it appeared on her face, she \nbecame mute and was not to be shaken in her \ndetermination. \n\n"You will change it, won't you?" said Lise. \nAnd as Princess Mary gave no answer, she left \nthe room. \n\nPrincess Mary was left alone. She did not \ncomply with Lise's request, she not only left \nher hair as it was, but did not even look in her \nglass. Letting her arms fall helplessly, she sat \nwith downcast eyes and pondered. A husband, \na man, a strong dominant and strangely attrac- \ntive being rose in her imagination, and carried \nher into a totally different happy world of his \nown. She fancied a child, her ouw such as she \nhad seen the day before in the arms of her \nnurse's daughter at her own breast, the hus- \nband standing by and gazing tenderly at her \nand the child. "But no, it is impossible, I am \ntoo ugly," she thought. \n\n"Please come to tea. The prince will be out \nin a moment," came the maid's voice at the \ndoor. \n\nShe roused herself, and felt appalled at what \nshe had been thinking, and before going down \nshe went into the room where the icons hung \nand, her eyes fixed on the dark face of a large \nicon of the Saviour lit by a lamp, she stood be- \nfore it with folded hands for a few moments. A \npainful doubt filled her soul. Could the joy of \nlove, of earthly love for a man, be for her? \nIn her thoughts of marriage Princess Mary \ndreamed of happiness and of children, but her \nstrongest, most deeply hidden longing was for \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nearthly love. The more she tried to hide this \nfeeling from others and even from herself, the \nstronger it grew. "O God," she said, "how am \nI to stifle in my heart these temptations of the \ndevil? How am I to renounce forever these vile \nfancies, so as peacefully to fulfill Thy will?" \nAnd scarcely had she put that question than \nGod gave her the answer in her own heart. \n"Desire nothing for thyself, seek nothing, be \nnot anxious or envious. Man's future and thy \nown fate must remain hidden from thee, but \nlive so that thou mayest be ready for anything. \nIf it be God's will to prove thee in the duties \nof marriage, be ready to fulfill His will." With \nthis consoling thought (but yet with a hope \nfor the fulfillment of her forbidden earthly \nlonging) Princess Mary sighed, and having \ncrossed herself went down, thinking neither of \nher gown and coifTure nor of how she would go \nin nor of what she would say. What could all \nthat matter in comparison with the will of \nGod, without Whose care not a hair of man's \nhead can fall? \n\nCHAPTER IV \n\nWHEN PRINCESS MARY came down, Prince Va- \nsili and his son were already in the drawing \nroom, talking to the little princess and Made- \nmoiselle Bourienne. When she entered with \nher heavy step, treading on her heels, the gen- \ntlemen and Mademoiselle Bourienne rose and \nthe little princess, indicating her to the gentle- \nmen, said: "Voila Marie!" Princess Mary saw \nthem all and saw them in detail. She saw Prince \nVasili's face, serious for an instant at the sight \nof her, but immediately smiling again, and the \nlittle princess curiously noting the impression \n"Marie" produced on the visitors. And she saw \nMademoiselle Bourienne, with her ribbon and \npretty face, and her unusually animated look \nwhich was fixed on him, but him she could not \nsee, she only saw something large, brilliant, \nand handsome moving toward her as she en- \ntered the room. Prince Vasf li approached first, \nand she kissed the bold forehead that bent \nover her hand and answered his question by \nsaying that, on the contrary, she remembered \nhim quite well. Then Anatole came up to her. \nShe still could not see him. She only felt a soft \nhand taking hers firmly, and she touched with \nher lips a white forehead, over which was beau- \ntiful light-brown hair smelling of pomade. \nWhen she looked up at him she was struck by \nhis beauty. Anatole stood with his right thumb \nunder a button of his uniform, his chest ex- \npanded and his back drawn in, slightly swing- \n\n\n\nBOOK \n\ning one foot, and, with his head a little bent, \nlooked with beaming face at the princess with- \nout speaking and evidently not thinking about \nher at all. Anatole was not quick-witted, nor \nready or eloquent in conversation, but he had \nthe faculty, so invaluable in society, of compo- \nsure and imperturbable self-possession. If a \nman lacking in self-confidence remains dumb \non a first introduction and betrays a conscious- \nness of the impropriety of such silence and an \nanxiety to find something to say, the effect is \nbad. But Anatole was dumb, swung his foot, and \nsmilingly examined the princess' hair. It was \nevident that he could be silent in this way for \na very long time. "If anyone finds this silence \ninconvenient, let him talk, but I don't want \nto," he seemed to say. Besides this, in his be- \nhavior to women Anatole had a manner which \nparticularly inspires in them curiosity, awe, \nand even lovea supercilious consciousness of \nhis own superiority. It was as if he said to them: \n"I know you, I know you, but why should I \nbother about you? You'd be only too glad, of \ncourse." Perhaps he did not really think this \nwhen he met women even probably he did \nnot, for in general he thought very little but \nhis looks and manner gave that impression. \nThe princess felt this, and as if wishing to show \nhim that she did not even dare expect to in- \nterest him, she turned to his father. The con- \nversation was general and animated, thanks to \nPrincess Lise's voice and little downy lip that \nlifted over her white teeth. She met Prince Va- \nsfli with that playful manner often employed \nby lively chatty people, and consisting in the \nassumption that between the person they so \naddress and themselves there are some semi- \nprivate, long-established jokes and amusing \nreminiscences, though no such reminiscences \nreally existjust as none existed in this case. \nPrince Vasfli readily adopted her tone and the \nlittle princess also drew Anatole, whom she \nhardly knew, into these amusing recollections \nof things that had never occurred. Mademoi- \nselle Bourienne also shared them and even \nPrincess Mary felt herself pleasantly made to \nshare in these merry reminiscences. \n\n"Here at least we shall have the benefit of \nyour company all to ourselves, dear prince," \nsaid the little princess (of course, in French) \nto Prince Vasili. "It's not as at Annette's l re- \nceptions where you always ran away; you re- \nmember cette chere Annette!" \n\n"Ah, but you won't talk politics to me like \nAnnette!" \n\n1 Anna Pavlovna. \n\n\n\n123 \n\n\n\nTHREE \n\n"And our little tea table?" \n\n"Oh, yes!" \n\n"Why is it you were never at Annette's?" the \nlittle princess asked Anatole. "Ah, I know, I \nknow," she said with a sly glance, "your broth- \ner Hippolyte told me about your goings on. \nOh!" and she shook her finger at him, "I have \neven heard of your doings in Paris!" \n\n"And didn't Hippolyte tell you?" asked \nPrince Vasili, turning to his son and seizing \nthe little princess' arm as if she would have run \naway and he had just managed to catch her, \n"didn't he tell you how he himself was pining \nfor the dear princess, and how she showed him \nthe door? Oh, she is a pearl among women, \nPrincess," he added, turning to Princess Mary. \n\nWhen Paris was mentioned, Mademoiselle \nBourienne for her part seized the opportunity \nof joining in the general current of recollec- \ntions. \n\nShe took the liberty of inquiring whether it \nwas long since Anatole had left Paris and how \nhe had liked that city. Anatole answered the \nFrenchwoman very readily and, looking at her \nwith a smile, talked to her about her native \nland. When he saw the pretty little Bourienne, \nAnatole came to the conclusion that he would \nnot find Bald Hills dull either. "Notatall bad!" \nhe thought, examining her, "not at all bad, \nthat little companion! I hope she will bring \nher along with her when we're married, la \npetite est gentille" * \n\nThe old prince dressed leisurely in his study, \nfrowning and considering what he was to do. \nThe coming of these visitors annoyed him. \n"What are Prince Vasili and that son of his to \nme? Prince Vasili is a shallow braggart and his \nson, no doubt, is a fine specimen, "he grumbled \nto himself. What angered him was that the \ncoming of these visitors revived in his mind an \nunsettled question he always tried to stifle, one \nabout which he always deceived himself. The \nquestion was whether he could ever bring him- \nself to part from his daughter and give her to \na husband. The prince never directly asked \nhimself that question, knowing beforehand \nthat he would have to answer it justly, and jus- \ntice clashed not only with his feelings but with \nthe very possibility of life. Life without Prin- \ncess Mary, little as he seemed to value her, was \nunthinkable to him. "And why should she \nmarry?" he thought. "To be unhappy for cer- \ntain. There's Lise, married to Andrew a bet- \nter husband one would think could hardly be \nfound nowadays but is she contented with \n\nThe little one is charming. \n\n\n\n124 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nher lot? And who would marry Marie for love? \nPlain and awkward! They'll take her for her \nconnections and wealth. Are there no women \nliving unmarried, and even the happier for it?" \nSo thought Prince Bolk6nski while dressing, \nand yet the question he was always putting off \ndemanded an immediate answer. Prince Vasfli \nhad brought his son with the evident inten- \ntion of proposing, and today or tomorrow he \nwould probably ask for an answer. His birth \nand position in society were not bad. "Well, \nI've nothing against it," the prince said to him- \nself, "but he must be worthy of her. And that \nis what we shall see." \n\n"That is what we shall see! That is what we \nshall see!" he added aloud. \n\nHe entered the drawing room with his usual \nalert step, glancing rapidly round the com- \npany. He noticed the change in the little prin- \ncess' dress, Mademoiselle Bourienne's ribbon, \nPrincess Mary's unbecoming coiffure, Made- \nmoiselle Bourienne's and Anatole's smiles, and \nthe loneliness of his daughter amid the general \nconversation. "Got herself up like a fool!" he \nthought, looking irritably at her. "She is shame- \nless, and he ignores her!" \n\nHe went straight up to Prince Vasili. \n"Well! How d'ye do? How d'ye do? Glad to \nsee you!" \n\n"Friendship laughs at distance," began Prince \nVasfli in his usual rapid, self-confident, familiar \ntone. "Here is my second son; please love and \nbefriend him." \n\nPrince Bolk6nski surveyed Anatole. \n"Fine young fellow! Fine young fellow!" he \nsaid. "Well, come and kiss me," and he offered \nhis cheek. \n\nAnatole kissed the old man, and looked at \nhim with curiosity and perfect composure, \nwaiting for a display of the eccentricities his \nfather had told him to expect. \n\nPrince Bolk6nski sat down in his usual place \nin the corner of the sofa and, drawing up an \narmchair for Prince Vasili, pointed to it and \nbegan questioning him about political affairs \nand news. He seemed to listen attentively to \nwhat Prince Vasfli said, but kept glancing at \nPrincess Mary. \n\n"And so they are writing from Potsdam al- \nready?" he said, repeating Prince Vasfli's last \nwords. Then rising, he suddenly went up to \nhis daughter. \n\n"Is it for visitors you've got yourself up like \nthat, eh?" said he. "Fine, very fine! You have \ndone up your hair in this new way for the visi- \ntors, and before the visitors I tell you that in \n\n\n\nfuture you are never to dare to change your \nway of dress without my consent." \n\n"It was my fault, mon pkre" interceded the \nlittle princess, with a blush. \n\n"You must do as you please," said Prince \nBolk6nski, bowing to his daughter-in-law, "but \nshe need not make a fool of herself, she's plain \nenough as it is." \n\nAnd he sat down again, paying no more at- \ntention to his daughter, who was reduced to \ntears. \n\n"On the contrary, that coiffure suits the \nprincess very well," said Prince Vasfli. \n\n"Now you, young prince, what's your name?" \nsaid Prince Bolk6nski, turning to Anatole, \n"come here, let us talk and get acquainted." \n\n"Now the fun begins," thought Anatole, sit- \nting down with a smile beside the old prince. \n\n"Well, my dear boy, I hear you've been edu- \ncated abroad, not taught to read and write by \nthe deacon, like your father and me. Now tell \nme, my dear boy, are you serving in the Horse \nGuards?" asked the old man, scrutinizing Ana- \ntole closely and intently. \n\n"No, I have been transferred to the line," \nsaid Anatole, hardly able to restrain his laugh- \nter. \n\n"Ah! That's a good thing. So, my dear boy, \nyou wish to serve the Tsar and the country? It \nis wartime. Such a fine fellow must serve. Well, \nare you off to the front?" \n\n"No, Prince, our regiment has gone to the \nfront, but I am attached . . . what is it I am at- \ntached to, Papa?" said Anatole, turning to his \nfather with a laugh. \n\n"A splendid soldier, splendid! 'What am I \nattached to!' Ha, ha, ha!" laughed Prince Bol- \nk6nski, and Anatole laughed still louder. Sud- \ndenly Prince Bolk6nski frowned. \n\n"You may go," he said to Anatole. \n\nAnatole returned smiling to the ladies. \n\n"And so you've had him educated abroad, \nPrince Vasfli, haven't you?" said the old prince \nto Prince Vasfli. \n\n"I have done my best for him, and I can as- \nsure you the education there is much better \nthan ours." \n\n"Yes, everything is different nowadays, every- \nthing is changed. The lad's a fine fellow, a fine \nfellow! Well, come with me now." He took \nPrince Vasfli's arm and led him to his study. \nAs soon as they were alone together, Prince \nVasfli announced his hopes and wishes to the \nold prince. \n\n"Well, do you think I shall prevent her, that \nI can't part from her?" said the old prince an- \n\n\n\nBOOK THREE \n\n\n\n125 \n\n\n\ngrily. "What an ideal I'm ready for it tomor- \nrow! Only let me tell you, I want to know my \nson-in-law better. You know my principles \neverything aboveboardl I will ask her tomor- \nrow in your presence; if she is willing, then he \ncan stay on. He can stay and I'll see." The old \nprince snorted. "Let her marry, it's all the same \nto me!" he screamed in the same piercing tone \nas when parting from his son. \n\n"I will tell you frankly," said Prince Vasili \nin the tone of a crafty man convinced of the \nfutility of being cunning with so keen-sighted \na companion. "You know, you see right through \npeople. Anatole is no genius, but he is an hon- \nest, goodhearted lad; an excellent son or kins- \nman." \n\n"All right, all right, we'll seel" \n\nAs always happens when women lead lonely \nlives for any length of time without male soci- \nety, on Anatole's appearance all the three wom- \nen of Prince Bolk6nski's household felt that \ntheir life had not been real till then. Their \npowers of reasoning, feeling, and observing \nimmediately increased tenfold, and their life, \nwhich seemed to have been passed in darkness, \nwas suddenly lit up by a new brightness, full of \nsignificance. \n\nPrincess Mary grew quite unconscious of her \nface and coiffure. The handsome open face of \nthe man who might perhaps be her husband \nabsorbed all her attention. He seemed to her \nkind, brave, determined, manly, and magnani- \nmous. She felt convinced of that. Thousands \nof dreams of a future family life continually \nrose in her imagination. She drove them away \nand tried to conceal them. \n\n"But am I not too cold with him?" thought \nthe princess. "I try to be reserved because in \nthe depth of my soul I feel too near to him al- \nready, but then he cannot know what I think of \nhim and may imagine that I do not like him." \n\nAnd Princess Mary tried, but could not man- \nage, to be cordial to her new guest. "Poor girl, \nshe's devilish ugly!" thought Anatole. \n\nMademoiselle Bourienne, also roused to \ngreat excitement by Anatole's arrival, thought \nin another way. Of course, she, a handsome \nyoung woman without any definite position, \nwithout relations or even a country, did not in- \ntend to devote her life to serving Prince Bol- \nk6nski, to reading aloud to him and being \nfriends with Princess Mary. Mademoiselle \nBourienne had long been waiting for a Rus- \nsian prince who, able to appreciate at a glance \nher superiority to the plain, badly dressed, un- \ngainly Russian princesses, would fall in love \n\n\n\nwith her and carry her off; and here at last \nwas a Russian prince. Mademoiselle Bourienne \nknew a story, heard from her aunt but finished \nin her own way, which she liked to repeat to \nherself. It was the story of a girl who had been \nseduced, and to whom her poor mother (sa \npauvre mtre) appeared, and reproached her \nfor yielding to a man without being married. \nMademoiselle Bourienne was often touched to \ntears as in imagination she told this story to \nhim, her seducer. And now he, a real Russian \nprince, had appeared. He would carry her \naway and then sa pauvre mtre would appear \nand he would marry her. So her future shaped \nitself in Mademoiselle Bourienne's head at the \nvery time she was talking to Anatole about \nParis. It was not calculation that guided her \n(she did not even for a moment consider what \nshe should do), but all this had long been famil- \niar to her, and now that Anatole had appeared \nit just grouped itself around him and she \nwished and tried to please him as much as pos- \nsible. \n\nThe little princess, like an old war horse \nthat hears the trumpet, unconsciously and quite \nforgetting her condition, prepared for the fa- \nmiliar gallop of coquetry, without any ulterior \nmotive or any struggle, but with naive and \nlighthearted gaiety. \n\nAlthough in female society Anatole usually \nassumed the role of a man tired of being run \nafter by women, his vanity was flattered by the \nspectacle of his power over these three women. \nBesides that, he was beginning to feel for the \npretty and provocative Mademoiselle Bouri- \nenne that passionate animal feeling which was \napt to master him with great suddenness and \nprompt him to the coarsest and most reckless \nactions. \n\nAfter tea, the company went into the sitting \nroom and Princess Mary was asked to play on \nthe clavichord. Anatole, laughing and in high \nspirits, came and leaned on his elbows, facing \nher and beside Mademoiselle Bourienne. Prin- \ncess Mary felt his look with a painfully joy- \nous emotion. Her favorite sonata bore her in- \nto a most intimately poetic world and the look \nshe felt upon her made that world still more \npoetic. But Anatole's expression, though \nhis eyes were fixed on her, referred not to \nher but to the movements of Mademoiselle \nBourienne's little foot, which he was. then \ntouching with his own under the clavichord. \nMademoiselle Bourienne was also look- \ning at Princess Mary, and in her lovely eyes \nthere was a look of fearful joy and hope \n\n\n\n126 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nthat was also new to the princess. \n\n"How she loves me I" thought Princess Mary. \n"How happy I am now, and how happy I may \nbe with such a friend and such a husband! \nHusband? Can it be possible?" she thought, \nnot daring to look at his face, but still feeling \nhis eyes gazing at her. \n\nIn the evening, after supper, when all were \nabout to retire, Anatole kissed Princess Mary's \nhand. She did not know how she found the \ncourage, but she looked straight into his hand- \nsome face as it came near to her shortsighted \n-eyes. Turning from Princess Mary he went up \nand kissed Mademoiselle Bourienne's hand. \n(This was not etiquette, but then he did every- \nthing so simply and with such assurancel) \nMademoiselle Bourienne flushed, and gave the \nprincess a frightened look. \n\n"What delicacy!" thought the princess. "Is it \npossible that Amdlie" (Mademoiselle Bouri- \nenne) "thinks I could be jealous of her, and \nnot value her pure affection and devotion to \nme?" She went up to her and kissed her warm- \nly. Anatole went up to kiss the little princess' \nhand. \n\n"No! No! No! When your father writfes to \ntell me that you are behaving well I will give \nyou my hand to kiss. Not till then!" she said. \nAnd smilingly raising a finger at him, she left \nthe room. \n\nCHAPTER V \n\nTHEY ALL SEPARATED, but, except Anatole who \nfell asleep as soon as he got into bed, all kept \nawake a long time that night. \n\n"Is he really to be my husband, this stranger \nwho is so kind yes, kind, that is the chief \nthing," thought Princess Mary; and fear, which \nshe had seldom experienced, came upon her. \nShe feared to look round, it seemed to her that \nsomeone was there standing behind the screen \nin the dark corner. And this someone was he \nthe devil and he was also this man with the \nwhite forehead, black eyebrows, and red lips. \n\nShe rang for her maid and asked her to sleep \nin her room. \n\nMademoiselle Bourienne walked up and \ndown the conservatory for a long time that eve- \nning, vainly expecting someone, now smiling \nat someone, now working herself up to tears \nwith the imaginary words of her pauvre mere \nrebuking her for her fall. \n\nThe ij^tle princess grumbled to her maid \nthat her bed was badly made. She could not lie \neither on her face or on her side. Every posi- \ntion was awkward and uncomfortable, and her \n\n\n\nburden oppressed her now more than ever be- \ncause Anatole's presence had vividly recalled \nto her the time when she was not like that and \nwhen everything was light and gay. She sat in \nan armchair in her dressing jacket and night- \ncap and Katie, sleepy and disheveled, beat and \nturned the heavy feather bed for the third \ntime, muttering to herself. \n\n"I told you it was all lumps and holes!" \nthe little princess repeated. "I should be glad \nenough to fall asleep, so it's not my fault!" and \nher voice quivered like that of a child about to \ncry. \n\nThe old prince did not sleep either. Tikhon, \nhalf asleep, heard him pacing angrily about \nand snorting. The old prince felt as though he \nhad been insulted through his daughter. The \ninsult was the more pointed because it con- \ncerned not himself but another, his daughter, \nwhom he loved more than himself. He kept \ntelling himself that he would consider the \nwhole matter and decide what was right and \nhow he should act, but instead of that he only \nexcited himself more and more. \n\n"The first man that turns up she forgets \nher father and everything else, runs upstairs \nand does up her hair and wags her tail and is \nunlike herself! Glad to throw her father over! \nAnd she knew I should notice it. Fr . . . fr . . . \nfr . . . ! And don't I see that that idiot had eyes \nonly for Bourienne I shall have to get rid of \nher. And how is it she has not pride enough \nto see it? If she has no pride for herself she \nmight at least have some for my sake! She must \nbe shown that the blockhead thinks nothing of \nher and looks only at Bourienne. No, she has \nno pride . . . but I'll let her see. . . ." \n\nThe old prince knew that if he told his \ndaughter she was making a mistake and that \nAna tole meant to flirt with Mademoiselle Bouri- \nenne, Princess Mary's self-esteem would be \nwounded and his point (not to be parted from \nher) would be gained, so pacifying himself \nwith this thought, he called Tikhon and began \nto undress. \n\n"What devil brought them here?" thought \nhe, while Tikhon was putting the nightshirt \nover his dried-up old body and gray-haired \nchest. "I never invited them. They came to dis- \nturb my life and there is not much of it left." \n\n"Devil take'em!" he muttered, while his head \nwas still covered by the shirt. \n\nTikhon knew his master's habit of some- \ntimes thinking aloud, and therefore met with \nunaltered looks the angrily inquisitive expres- \nsion of the face that emerged from the shirt. \n\n\n\nBOOK THREE \n\n\n\n127 \n\n\n\n"Gone to bed?" asked the prince. \n\nTikhon, like all good valets, instinctively \nknew the direction of his master's thoughts. He \nguessed that the question referred to Prince \nVasfli and his son. \n\n"They have gone to bed and put out their \nlights, your excellency." \n\n"No good ... no good . . ." said the prince \nrapidly, and thrusting his feet into his slippers \nand his arms into the sleeves of his dressing \ngown, he went to the couch on which he slept. \n\nThough no words had passed between Ana- \ntole and Mademoiselle Bourienne, they quite \nunderstood one another as to the first part of \ntheir romance, up to the appearance of the \npauvre mere; they understood that they had \nmuch to say to one another in private and so \nthey had been seeking an opportunity since \nmorning to meet one another alone. When \nPrincess Mary went to her father's room at the \nusual hour, Mademoiselle Bourienne and Ana- \ntole met in the conservatory. \n\nPrincess Mary went to the door of the study \nwith special trepidation. It seemed to her that \nnot only did everybody know that her fate \nwould be decided that day, but that they also \nknew what she thought about it. She read this \nin Tikhon's face and in that of Prince Vasili's \nvalet, who made her a low bow when she met \nhim in the corridor carrying hot water. \n\nThe old prince was very affectionate and \ncareful in his treatment of his daughter that \nmorning. Princess Mary well knew this pains- \ntaking expression of her father's. His face wore \nthat expression when his dry hands clenched \nwith vexation at her not understanding a sum \nin arithmetic, when rising from his chair he \nwould walk away from her, repeating in a low \nvoice the same words several times over. \n\nHe came to the point at once, treating her \nceremoniously. \n\n"I have had a proposition made me concern- \ning you," he said with an unnatural smile. "I \nexpect you have guessed that Prince Vasili has \nnot come and brought his pupil with him" \n(for some reason Prince Bolktinski referred to \nAnatole as a "pupil") "for the sake of my beau- \ntiful eyes. Last night a proposition was made \nme on your account and, as you know my prin- \nciples, I refer it to you." \n\n"How am I to understand you, man perel" \nsaid the princess, growing pale and then blush- \ning. \n\n"How understand me!" cried her father an- \ngrily. "Prince Vasfli finds you to his taste as a \ndaughter-in-law and makes a proposal to you \n\n\n\non his pupil's behalf. That's how it's to be un- \nderstood 1 'How understand it'! ... And I ask \nyou!" \n\n"I do not know what you think, Father," \nwhispered the princess. \n\n"I? I? What of me? Leave me out of the \nquestion. I'm not going to get married. What \nabout you? That's what I want to know." \n\nThe princess saw that her father regarded \nthe matter with disapproval, but at that mo- \nment the thought occurred to her that her fate \nwould be decided now or never. She lowered \nher eyes so as not to see the gaze under which \nshe felt that she could not think, but would \nonly be able to submit from habit, and she \nsaid: "I wish only to do your will, but if I had \nto express my own desire . . ." She had no time \nto finish. The old prince interrupted her. \n\n"That's admirable!" he shouted. "He will \ntake you with your dowry and take Mademoi- \nselle Bourienne into the bargain. She'll be the \nwife, while you . . ." \n\nThe prince stopped. He saw the effect these \nwords had produced on his daughter. She low- \nered her head and was ready to burst into tears. \n\n"Now then, now then, I'm only joking!" he \nsaid. "Remember this, Princess, I hold to the \nprinciple that a maiden has a full right to \nchoose. I give you freedom. Only remember \nthat your life's happiness depends on your de- \ncision. Never mind me!" \n\n"But I do not know. Father!" \n\n"There's no need to talk! He receives his \norders and will marry you or anybody; but you \nare free to choose. ... Go to your room, think \nit over, and come back in an hour and tell me \nin his presence: yes or no. I know you will pray \nover it. Well, pray if you like, but you had bet- \nter think it over. Go! Yes or no, yes or no, yes \nor no!" he still shouted when the princess, as \nif lost in a fog, had already staggered out of the \nstudy. \n\nHer fate was decided and happily decided. \nBut what her father had said about Mademoi- \nselle Bourienne was dreadful. It was untrue to \nbe sure, but still it was terrible, and she could \nnot help thinking of it. She was going straight \non through the conservatory, neither seeing \nnor hearing anything, when suddenly the well- \nknown whisperingof Mademoiselle Bourienne \naroused her. She raised her eyes, and two steps \naway saw Anatole embracing the Frenchwom- \nan and whispering something to her. With a \nhorrified expression on his handsome face, An- \natole looked at Princess Mary, but did not at \nonce take his arm from the waist of Mademoi- \n\n\n\n128 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nselle Bourienne who had not yet seen her. \n\n"Who's that? Why? Wait a moment!" Ana- \ntole's face seemed to say. Princess Mary looked \nat them in silence. She could not understand \nit. At last Mademoiselle Bourienne gave a \nscream and ran away. Anatole bowed to Prin- \ncess Mary with a gay smile, as if inviting her to \njoin in a laugh at this strange incident, and \nthen shrugging his shoulders went to the door \nthat led to his own apartments. \n\nAn hour later, Ti'khon came to call Princess \nMary to the old prince; he added that Prince \nVasiii was also there. When Tikhon came to \nher Princess Mary was sitting on the sofa in \nher room, holding the weeping Mademoiselle \nBourienne in her arms and gently stroking her \nhair. The princess* beautiful eyes with all their \nformer calm radiance were looking with tend- \ner affection and pity at Mademoiselle Bouri- \nenne's pretty face. \n\n"No, Princess, I have lost your affection for- \never 1" said Mademoiselle Bourienne. \n\n"Why? I love you more than ever/'said Prin- \ncess Mary, "and I will try to do all I can for \nyour happiness." \n\n"But you despise me. You who are so pure \ncan never understand being so carried away by \npassion. Oh, only my poor mother . . ." \n\n"I quite understand," answered Princess \nMary, with a sad smile. "Calm yourself, my \ndear. I will go to my father," she said, and went \nout. \n\nPrince Vasiii, with one leg thrown high over \nthe other and a snuffbox in his hand, was sit- \nting there with a smile of deep emotion on his \nface, as if stirred to his heart's core and himself \nregretting and laughing at his own sensibility, \nwhen Princess Mary entered. He hurriedly took \na pinch of snuff. \n\n"Ah, my dear, my dear!" he began, rising \nand taking her by both hands. Then, sighing, \nhe added: "My son's fate is in your hands. De- \ncide, my dear, good, gentle Marie, whom I have \nalways loved as a daughter!" \n\nHe drew back and a real tear appeared in \nhis eye. \n\n"Fr ... fr ..." snorted Prince Bolkdnski. \n"The prince is making a proposition to you in \nhis pupil's I mean, his son'sname. Do you \nwish or not to be Prince Anatole Kurdgin's \nwife? Reply: yes or no," he shouted, "and then \nI shall reserve the right to state my opinion al- \nso. Yes, my opinion, and only my opinion," \nadded Prince Bolk6nski, turning to Prince Va- \nsiii and answering his imploring look. "Yes, or \nno?" \n\n\n\n"My desire is never to leave you, Father, nev- \ner to separate my life from yours. I don't wish \nto marry," she answered positively, glancing at \nPrince Vasiii and at her father with her beauti- \nful eyes. \n\n"Humbug! Nonsense! Humbug, humbug, \nhumbug!" cried Prince Bolk6nski, frowning \nand taking his daughter's hand; he did not kiss \nher, but only bending his forehead to hers just \ntouched it, and pressed her hand so that she \nwinced and uttered a cry. \n\nPrince Vasfli rose. \n\n"My dear, I must tell you that this is a \nmoment I shall never, never forget. But, \nmy dear, will you not give us a little hope of \ntouching this heart, so kind and generous? \nSay 'perhaps' . . . The future is so long. Say \n'perhaps.' " \n\n"Prince, what I have said is all there is in my \nheart. I thank you for the honor, but I shall \nnever be your son's wife." \n\n"Well, so that's finished, my dear fellow! I \nam very glad to have seen you. Very glad! Go \nback to your rooms, Princess. Go!" said the old \nprince. "Very, very glad to have seen you," re* \npeated he, embracing Prince Vasfli. \n\n"My vocation is a different one," thought \nPrincess Mary. "My vocation is to be happy \nwith another kind of happiness, the happiness \nof love and self-sacrifice. And cost what it may, \nI will arrange poor Am^lie's happiness, she \nloves him so passionately, and so passionately \nrepents. I will do all I can to arrange tjje match \nbetween them. If he is not rich I will^give her \nthe means; I will ask my father and Andrew. I \nshall be so happy when she is his wife. She is \nso unfortunate, a stranger, alone, helpless! And, \noh God, how passionately she must love him if \nshe could so far forget herself! Perhaps I might \nhave done the same! . . ." thought Princess \nMary. \n\nCHAPTER VI \n\nIT WAS long since the Rost6vs had news of \nNicholas. Not till midwinter was the count at \nlast handed a letter addressed in his son's hand- \nwriting. On receiving it, he ran on tiptoe to his \nstudy in alarm and haste, trying to escape no- \ntice, closed the door, and began to read the \nletter. \n\nAnna Mikhdylovna, who always knew every- \nthing that passed in the house, on hearing of \nthe arrival of the letter went softly into the \nroom and found the count with it in his hand, \nsobbing and laughing at the same time. \n\nAnna MikMylovna, though her circum- \n\n\n\nBOOK \n\nstances had improved, was still living with the \nRost6vs. \n\n"My dear friend?" said she, in a tone of pa- \nthetic inquiry, prepared to sympathize in any \nway. \n\nThe count sobbed yet more. \n\n"Nik61enka ... a letter ... wa ... a ... s \n. . . wounded . . . my darling boy . . . the count- \ness ... promoted to be an officer . . . thank God \n. . . How tell the little countessl" \n\nAnna Mikhaylovna sat down beside him, with \nher own handkerchief wiped the tears from his \neyes and from the letter, then having dried her \nown eyes she comforted the count, and decided \nthat at dinner and till teatime she would pre- \npare the countess, and after tea, with God's \nhelp, would inform her. \n\nAt dinner Anna Mikhaylovna talked the \nwhole time about the war news and about Ni- \nk61enka, twice asked when the last letter had \nbeen received from him, though she knew that \nalready, and remarked that they might very \nlikely be getting a letter from him that day. \nEach time that these hints began to make the \ncountess anxious and she glanced uneasily at \nthe count and at Anna Mikhaylovna, the lat- \nter very adroitly turned the conversation to in- \nsignificant matters. Natasha, who, of the whole \nfamily, was the most gifted with a capacity to \nfeel any shades of intonation, look, and ex- \npression, pricked up her ears from the begin- \nning of the meal and was certain that there \nwas some secret between her father and Anna \nMikhay'-vna, that it had something to do with \nher brotuer, and that Anna Mikh;iylovna was \npreparing them for it. Bold as she was, Nata- \nsha, who knew how sensitive her mother was \nto anything relating to Nik61enka,did not ven- \nture to ask any questions at dinner, but she \nwas too excited to eat anything and kept wrig- \ngling about on her chair regardless of her gov- \nerness' remarks. After dinner, she rushed head- \nlong after Anna Mikhdylovna and, dashing at \nher, flung herself on her neck as soon as she \novertook her in the sitting room. \n\n"Auntie, darling, do tell me what it is!" \n\n"Nothing, my dear." \n\n"No, dearest, sweet one, honey, I won't give \nup I know you know something." \n\nAnna Mikhaylovna shook her head. \n\n"You are a little slyboots," she said. \n\n"A letter from Nik61enka! I'm sure of it!" \nexclaimed Natasha, reading confirmation in \nAnna Mikhaylovna's face. \n\n"But for God's sake, be careful, you know \nhow it may affect your mamma." \n\n\n\nTHREE 129 \n\n"I will, I will, only tell mel You won't? Then \nI will go and tell at once." \n\nAnna Mikhaylovna, in a few words, told her \nthe contents of the letter, on condition that \nshe should tell no one. \n\n"No, on my true word of honor," said Nata- \nsha, crossing herself, "I won't tell anyone!" and \nshe ran off at once to S6nya. \n\n"Nik61enka . . . wounded ... a letter," she \nannounced in gleeful triumph. \n\n"Nicholas!" was all Sonya said, instantly \nturning white. \n\nNatasha, seeing the impression the news of \nher brother's wound produced on S6nya, felt for*' \nthe first time the sorrowful side of the news. \n\nShe rushed to S6nya, hugged her, and began \nto cry. \n\n"A little wound, but he has been made an \nofficer; he is well now, he wrote himself," said \nshe through her tears. \n\n"There now! It's true that all you women \nare crybabies," remarked Pe*tya, pacing the \nroom with large, resolute strides. "Now I'm \nvery glad, very glad indeed, that my brother \nhas distinguished himself so. You are all blub- \nberers and understand nothing." \n\nNatasha smiled through her tears. \n\n"You haven't read the letter?" asked Sonya. \n\n"No, but she said that it was all over and \nthat he's now an officer." \n\n"Thank God!" said S6nya, crossing herself. \n"But perhaps she deceived you. Let us go to \nMamma." \n\nPdtya paced the room in silence for a time. \n\n"If I'd been in Nik61enka's place I would \nhave killed even more of those Frenchmen," \nhe said. "What nasty brutes they are! I'd have \nkilled so many that there'd have been a heap \nof them." \n\n"Hold your tongue, P(hya, what a goose you \nare!" \n\n"I'm not a goose, but they are who cry about \ntrifles," said Pdtya. \n\n"Do you remember him?" Natdsha suddenly \nasked, after a moment's silence. \n\nS6nya smiled. \n\n"Do I remember Nicholas?" \n\n"No, S6nya, but do you remember so that \nyou remember him perfectly, remember every- \nthing?" said Natdsha, with an expressive ges- \nture, evidently wishing to give her words a very \ndefinite meaning. "I remember Nik61enka too, \nI remember him well," she said. "But I don't \nremember Borfs. I don't remember him a bit." \n\n"What! You don't remember Boris?" asked \nS6nya in surprise. \n\n\n\n130 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\n"It's not that I don't rememberI know what \nhe is like, but not as I remember Nik61enka. \nHimI just shut my eyes and remember, but \nBoris . . . No!" (She shut her eyes.) "No! there's \nnothing at all." \n\n"Oh, Natdsha!" said S6nya, looking ecstati- \ncally and earnestly at her friend as if she did \n-ot consider her worthy to hear what she meant \n&gt; say and as if she were saying it to someone \nIse, with whom joking was out of the ques- \n[on, "I am in love with your brother once for \n11 and, whatever may happen to him or to me, \nhall never cease to love him as long as I live." \n\nNatdsha looked at S6nya with wondering \n\nnd inquisitive eyes, and said nothing. She felt \n\nlat Sonya was speaking the truth, that there \n\nras such love as S6nya was speaking of. But \n\n_ Jatdsha had not yet felt anything like it. She \n\nbelieved it could be, but did not understand it. \n\n"Shall you write to him?" she asked. \n\nS6nya became thoughtful. The question of \nhow to write to Nicholas, and whether she \nought to write, tormented her. Now that he \nwas already an officer and a wounded hero, \nwould it be right to remind him of herself and, \nas it might seem, of the obligations to her he \nhad taken on himself? \n\n"I don't know. I think if he writes, I will \nwrite too," she said, blushing. \n\n"And you won't feel ashamed to write to \nhim?" \n\nS6nya smiled. \n\n"No." \n\n"And I should be ashamed to write to Boris. \nI'm not going to." \n\n"Why should you be ashamed?" \n\n"Well, I don't know. It's awkward and \nwould make me ashamed." \n\n"And I know why she'd be ashamed," said \nPe'tya, offended by Natasha's previous remark. \n"It's because she was in love with that fat one \nin spectacles" (that was how Ptya described \nhis namesake, the new Count Bezukhov) "and \nnow she's in love with that singer" (he meant \nNatdsha's Italian singing master), "that's why \nshe's ashamed!" \n\n"Ptya, you're a stupid!" said Natdsha. \n\n"Not more stupid than you, madam," said \nthe nine-year-old Ptya, with the air of an old \nbrigadier. \n\nThe countess had been prepared by Anna \nMikhdylovna's hints at dinner. On retiring to \nher own room, she sat in an armchair, her eyes \nfixed on a miniature portrait of her son on the \nlid of a snuffbox, while the tears kept coming \ninto her eyes. Anna Mikhdylovna, with the let- \n\n\n\nter, came on tiptoe to the countess' door and \npaused. \n\n"Don't come in," she said to the old count \nwho was following her, "Come later." And she \nwent in, closing the door behind her. \n\nThe count put his ear to the keyhole and lis- \ntened. \n\nAt first he heard the sound of indifferent \nvoices, then Anna Mikhdylovna's voice alone \nin a long speech, then a cry, then silence, then \nboth voices together with glad intonations, \nand then footsteps. Anna Mikhdylovna opened \nthe door. Her face wore the proud expression \nof a surgeon who has just performed a difficult \noperation and admits the public to appreciate \nhis skill. \n\n"It is donel" she said to the count, pointing \ntriumphantly to the countess, who sat holding \nin one hand the snuffbox with its portrait and \nin the other the letter, and pressing them al- \nternately to her lips. \n\nWhen she saw the count, she stretched out \nher arms to him, embraced his bald head, over \nwhich she again looked at the letter and the \nportrait, and in order to press them again to \nher lips, she slightly pushed away the bald \nhead. Ve&gt;a, Natasha, S6nya, and Ptya now en- \ntered the room, and the reading of the letter \nbegan. After a brief description of the cam- \npaign and the two battles in which he had tak- \nen part, and his promotion, Nicholas said that \nhe kissed his father's and mother's hands ask- \ning for their blessing, and that he kissed Vra, \nNatdsha, and PiHya. Besides that, he sent greet- \nings to Monsieur Schelling, Madame Schoss, \nand his old nurse, and asked them to kiss for \nhim "dear S6nya, whom he loved and thought \nof just the same as ever." When she heard this \nS6nya blushed so that tears came into her eyes \nand, unable to bear the looks turned upon her, \nran away into the dancing hall, whirled round \nit at full speed with her dress puffed out like a \nballoon, and, flushed and smiling, plumped \ndown on the floor. The countess was crying. \n\n"Why are you crying, Mamma?" asked Vdra. \n"From all he says one should be glad and not \ncry." \n\nThis was quite true, but the count, the count- \ness, and Natasha looked at her reproachfully. \n"And who is it she takes after?" thought the \ncountess. \n\nNicholas' letter was read over hundreds of \ntimes, and those who were considered worthy \nto hear it had to come to the countess, for she \ndid not let it out of her hands. The tutors came, \nand the nurses, and Dmitri, and several ac \n\n\n\nBOOK THREE \n\n\n\nquaintances, and the countess reread the letter \neach time with fresh pleasure and each time \ndiscovered in it fresh proofs of Nik61enka's vir- \ntues. How strange, how extraordinary, how joy- \nful it seemed, that her son, the scarcely per- \nceptible motion of whose tiny limbs she had \nfelt twenty years ago within her, that son about \nwhom she used to have quarrels with the too- \nindulgent count, that son who had first learned \nto say "pear" and then "granny," that this son \nshould now be away in a foreign land amid \nstrange surroundings, a manly warrior doing \nsome kind of man's work of his own, without \nhelp or guidance. The universal experience of \nages, showing that children do grow impercep- \ntibly from the cradle to manhood, did not exist \nfor the countess. Her son's growth toward man- \nhood, at each of its stages, had seemed as extra- \nordinary to her as if there had never existed \nthe millions of human beings who grew up in \nthe same way. As twenty years before, it seemed \nimpossible that the little creature who lived \nsomewhere under her heart would ever cry, \nsuck her breast, and begin to speak, so now she \ncould not believe that that little creature could \nbe this strong, brave man, this model son and \nofficer that, judging by this letter, he now was. \n\n"What a style! How charmingly he describes!" \nsaid she, reading the descriptive part of the let- \nter. "And what a soul! Not a word about him- \nself. . . . Not a word! About some Denisov or \nother, though he himself, I dare say, is braver \nthan any of them. He says nothing about his \nsufferings. What a heart! How like him it is! \nAnd how he has remembered everybody! Not \nforgetting anyone. I always said when he was \nonly so high I always said . . ." \n\nFor more than a week preparations were be- \ning made, rough drafts of letters to Nicholas \nfrom all the household were written and copied \nout, while under the supervision of the count- \ness and the solicitude of the count, money and \nall things necessary for the uniform and equip- \nment of the newly commissioned officer were \ncollected. Anna Mikhaylovna, practical wom- \nan that she was, had even managed by favor \nwith army authorities to secure advantageous \nmeans of communication for herself and her \nson . She had opportunities of sending her letters \nto the Grand Duke Constan tine Pdvlovich, who \ncommanded the Guards. The Rost6vs supposed \nthat The Russian Guards, A broad, was quite a \ndefinite address, and that if a letter reached \nthe Grand Duke in command of the Guards \nthere was no reason why it should not reach \nthe Pavlograd regiment, which was presuma- \n\n\n\nbly somewhere in the same neighborhood. And \nso it was decided to send the letters and money \nby the Grand Duke's courier to Boris and Boris \nwas to forward them to Nicholas. The letters \nwere from the old count, the countess, Ptya, \nVe*ra, Natasha, and S6nya, and finally there \nwere six thousand rubles for his outfit and vari- \nous other things the old count sent to his son. \n\nCHAPTER VII \n\nON THE twelfth of November, Kutiizov's active \narmy, in camp before Olmiitz, was preparing \nto be reviewed next day by the two Emperors \nthe Russian and the Austrian. The Guards, \njust arrived from Russia, spent the night ten \nmiles from Olmiitz and next morning were to \ncome straight to the review, reaching the field \nat Olmiitz by ten o'clock. \n\nThat day Nicholas Rost6v received a letter \nfrom Borfs, telling him that the Ismaylov regi- \nment was quartered for the night ten miles \nfrom Olmiitz and that he wanted to see him as \nhe had a letter and money for him. Rostov was \nparticularly in need of money now that the \ntroops, after their active service, were stationed \nnear Olmiitz and the camp swarmed with well- \nprovisioned sutlers and Austrian Jews offering \nall sorts of tempting wares. The Pavlograds \nheld feast after feast, celebrating awards they \nhad received for the campaign, and made ex- \npeditions to Olmiitz to visit a certain Caroline \nthe Hungarian, who had recently opened ares- \ntaurant there with girls as waitresses. Rost6v, \nwho had just celebrated his promotion to a \ncornetcy and bought Denfsov's horse, Bedouin, \nwas in debt all round, to his comrades and the \nsutlers. On receiving Boris' letter he rode with \na fellow officer to Olmiitz, dined there, drank \na bottle of wine, and then set off alone to the \nGuards' camp to find his old playmate. Rost6v \nhad not yet had time to get his uniform. He \nhad on a shabby cadet jacket, decorated with \na soldier's cross, equally shabby cadet's riding \nbreeches lined with worn leather, and an of- \nficer's saber with a sword knot. The Don horse \nhe was riding was one he had bought from a \nCossack during the campaign, and he wore a \ncrumpled hussar cap stuck jauntily back on \none side of his head. As he rode up to the camp \nhe thought how he would impress Borfs and all \nhis comrades of the Guards by his appearance \nthat of a fighting hussar who had been under \nfire. \n\nThe Guards had made their whole march as \nif on a pleasure trip, parading their cleanli- \nness and discipline. They had come by easy \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nstages, their knapsacks conveyed on carts, and \nthe Austrian authorities had provided excel- \nlent dinners for the officers at every halting \nplace. The regiments had entered and left the \ntown with their bands playing, and by the \nGrand Duke's orders the men had marched all \nthe way instep (a practice on which the Guards \nprided themselves), the officers on foot and at \ntheir proper posts. Boris had been quartered, \nand had marched all the way, with Berg who \nwas already in command of a company. Berg, \nwho had obtained his captaincy during the \ncampaign, had gained the confidence of his \nsuperiors by his promptitude and accuracy and \nhad arranged his money matters very satisfac- \ntorily. Boris, during the campaign, had made \nthe acquaintance of many persons who might \nprove useful to him, and by a letter of recom- \nmendation he had brought from Pierre had be- \ncome acquainted with Prince Andrew Bolk6n- \nski, through whom he hoped to obtain a post \non the commander in chief's staff. Berg and \nBoris, having rested after yesterday's march, \nwere sitting, clean and neatly dressed, at a \nround table in the clean quarters allotted to \nthem, playing chess. Berg held a smoking pipe \nbetween his knees. Boris, in the accurate way \ncharacteristic of him, was building a little pyra- \nmid of chessmen with his delicate white fingers \nwhile awaiting Berg's move, and watched his \nopponent's face, evidently thinking about the \ngame as he always thought only of whatever he \nwas engaged on. \n\n"Well, how are you going to get out of that?" \nhe remarked. \n\n"We'll try to," replied Berg, touching a \npawn and then removing his hand. \n\nAt that moment the door opened. \n\n"Here he is at last!" shouted Rost6v. "And \nBerg too! Oh, you petisenfans, allay cushay \ndormir!" * he exclaimed, imitating his Russian \nnurse's French, at which he and Boris used to \nlaugh long ago. \n\n"Dear me, how you have changed!" \n\nBoris rose to meet Rost6v, but in doing so \ndid not omit to steady and replace some chess- \nmen that were falling. He was about to em- \nbrace his friend, but Nicholas avoided him. \nWith that peculiar feeling of youth, that dread \nof beaten tracks, and wish to express itself in a \nmanner different from that of its elders which \nis often insincere, Nicholas wished to do some- \nthing special on meeting his friend. He wanted \nto pinch him, push him, do anything but kiss \nhima thing everybody did. But notwithstand- \n\n1 "Little children, go to bed and sleep."-TR. \n\n\n\ning this, Boris embraced him in a quiet, friend- \nly way and kissed him three times. \n\nThey had not met for nearly half a year and, \nbeing at the age when young men take their \nfirst steps on life's road, each saw immense \nchanges in the other, quite a new reflection of \nthe society in which they had taken those first \nsteps. Both had changed greatly since they last \nmet and both were in a hurry to show the \nchanges that had taken place in them. \n\n"Oh, you damned dandies! Clean and fresh \nas if you'd been to a fete, not like us sinners of \nthe line," cried Rost6v, with martial swagger \nand with baritone notes in his voice, new to \nBoris, pointing to his own mud-bespattered \nbreeches. The German landlady, hearing Ros- \ntov's loud voice, popped her head in at the \ndoor. \n\n"Eh, is she pretty?" he asked with a wink. \n\n"Why do you shout so? You'll frighten them ! " \nsaid Boris. "I did not expect you today," he \nadded. "I only sent you the note yesterday by \nBolk6nski an adjutant of Kutuzov's, who's a \nfriend of mine. I did not think he would get it \n\nto you so quickly Well, how are you? Been \n\nunder fire already?" asked Boris. \n\nWithout answering, Rostov shook the sol- \ndier's Cross of St. George fastened to the cord- \ning of his uniform and, indicating a bandaged \narm, glanced at Berg with a smile. \n\n"As you see," he said. \n\n"Indeed? Yes, yes!" said Boris, with a smile. \n"And we too have had a splendid march. You \nknow, of course, that His Imperial Highness \nrode with our regiment all the time, so that we \nhad every comfort and every advantage. What \nreceptions we had in Poland! What dinners \nand balls! I can't tell you. And the Tsarvich \nwas very gracious to all our officers." \n\nAnd the two friends told each other of their \ndoings, the one of his hussar revels and life in \nthe fighting line, the other of the pleasures \nand advantages of service under members of \nthe Imperial family. \n\n"Oh, you Guards!" said Rost6v. "I say, send \nfor some wine." \n\nBoris made a grimace. \n\n"If you really want it," said he. \n\nHe went to his bed, drew a purse from un- \nder the clean pillow, and sent for wine. \n\n"Yes, and I have some money and a letter to \ngive you," he added. \n\nRost6v took the letter and, throwing the \nmoney on the sofa, put both arms on the table \nand began to read. After reading a few lines, \nhe glanced angrily at Berg, then, meeting his \n\n\n\nBOOK THREE \n\n\n\n133 \n\n\n\neyes, hid his face behind the letter. \n\n"Well, they've sent you a tidy sum," said \nBerg, eying the heavy purse that sank into the \nsofa. "As for us, Count, -we get along on our \npay. I can tell you for myself . . ." \n\n"I say, Berg, my dear fellow," said Rost6v, \n"when you get a letter from home and meet \none of your own people whom you want to \ntalk everything over with, and I happen to be \nthere, I'll go at once, to be out of your way! \nDo go somewhere, anywhere ... to the devil 1" \nhe exclaimed, and immediately seizing him by \nthe shoulder and looking amiably into his face, \nevidently wishing to soften the rudeness of his \nwords, he added, "Don't be hurt, my dear fel- \nlow; you know I speak from my heart as to an \nold acquaintance." \n\n"Oh, don't mention it, Count! I quite un- \nderstand," said Berg, getting up and speaking \nin a muffled and guttural voice. \n\n"Go across to our hosts: they invited you," \nadded Boris. \n\nBerg put on the cleanest of coats, without a \nspot or speck of dust, stood before a looking \nglass and brushed the hair on his temples up- \nwards, in the way affected by the Emperor \nAlexander, and, having assured himself from \nthe way Rostov looked at it that his coat had \nbeen noticed, left the room with a pleasant \nsmile. \n\n"Oh dear, what a beast I am!" muttered Ros- \ntov, as he read the letter. \n\n"Why?" \n\n"Oh, what a pig I am, not to have written \nand to have given them such a fright! Oh, what \na pig I am!" he repeated, flushing suddenly. \n"Well, have you sent Gabriel for some wine? \nAll right let's have some!" \n\nIn the letter from his parents was enclosed a \nletter of recommendation to Bagrati6n which \nthe old countess at Anna Mikhdylovna's advice \nhad obtained through an acquaintance and \nsent to her son, asking him to take it to its des- \ntination and make use of it. \n\n"What nonsense! Much I need it!" said Ros- \nt6v, throwing the letter under the table. \n\n"Why have you thrown that away?" asked \nBoris. \n\n"It is some letter of recommendation . . . \nwhat the devil do I want it for!" \n\n"Why 'What the devil'?" said Boris, picking \nit up and reading the address. "This letter \nwould be of great use to you." \n\n"I want nothing, and I won't be anyone's \nadjutant." \n\n"Why not?" inquired Boris. \n\n\n\n"It's a lackey's job!" \n\n"You are still the same dreamer, I see," re- \nmarked Boris, shaking his head. \n\n"And you're still the same diplomatist! But \nthat's not the point. . . . Come, how are you?" \nasked Rost6v. \n\n"Well, as you see. So far everything's all \nright, but I confess I should much like to be an \nadjutant and not remain at the front." \n\n"Why?" \n\n"Because when once a man starts on military \nservice, he should try to make as successful a \ncareer of it as possible." \n\n"Oh, that's it!" said Rost6v, evidently think- \ning of something else. \n\nHe looked intently and inquiringly into his \nfriend's eyes, evidently trying in vain to find \nthe answer to some question. \n\nOld Gabriel brought in the wine. \n\n"Shouldn't we now send for Berg?" asked \nBoris. "He would drink with you. I can't." \n\n"Well, send for him . . . and how do you get \non with that German?" asked Rost6v, with a \ncontemptuous smile. \n\n"He is a very, very nice, honest, and pleasant \nfellow," answered Boris. \n\nAgain Rost6v looked intently into Boris* \neyes and sighed. Berg returned, and over the \nbottle of wine conversation between the three \nofficers became animated. The Guardsmen told \nRost6v of their march and how they had been \nmade much of in Russia, Poland, and abroad. \nThey spoke of the sayings and doings of their \ncommander, the Grand Duke, and told stories \nof his kindness and irascibility. Berg, as usual, \nkept silent when the subject did not relate to \nhimself, but in connection with the stories of \nthe Grand Duke's quick temper he related with \ngusto how in Galicia he had managed to deal \nwith the Grand Duke when the latter made a \ntour of the regiments and was annoyed at the \nirregularity of a movement. With a pleasant \nsmile Berg related how the Grand Duke had \nridden up to him in a violent passion, shout- \ning: "Arnautsl" 1 ("Arnauts" was the Tsare"- \nvich's favorite expression when he was in a \nrage) and called for the company commander, \n\n"Would you believe it, Count, I was not at \nall alarmed, because I knew I was right. With- \nout boasting, you know, I may say that I know \nthe Army Orders by heart and know the Regu- \nlations as well as I do the Lord's Prayer. So, \nCount, there never is any negligence in my \n\n1 Arnauts is a Turkish name for the Albanians, \nwho supplied the Turks with irregular cavalry. \n\n-TR. \n\n\n\n'34 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\ncompany, and so my conscience was at ease. I \n\ncame forward " (Berg stood up and showed \n\nhow he presented himself, with his hand to his \ncap, and really it would have been difficult for \na face to express greater respect and self- \ncomplacency than his did.) "Well, he stormed \nat me, as the saying is, stormed andstormedand \nstormed! It was not a matter of life but rather \nof death, as the saying is. 'Albanians!' and 'dev- \nils!' and 'To Siberia!' " said Berg with a saga- \ncious smile. "I knew I was in the right so I kept \nsilent; was not that best, Count? . . . 'Hey, are \nyou dumb?' he shouted. Still I remained silent. \nAnd what do you think, Count? The next day \nit was not even mentioned in the Orders of the \nDay. That's what keeping one's head means. \nThat's the way, Count," said Berg, lighting his \npipe and emitting rings of smoke. \n\n"Yes, that was fine," said Rostov, smiling. \n\nBut Boris noticed that he was preparing to \nmake fun of Berg, and skillfully changed the \nsubject. He asked him to tell them how and \nwhere he got his wound. This pleased Rost6v \nand he began talking about it, and as he went \non became more and more animated. He told \nthem of his Schon Grabern affair, just as those \nwho have taken part in a battle generally do \ndescribe it, that is, as they would like it to have \nbeen, as they have heard it described by others, \nand as sounds well, but not at all as it really \nwas. Rost6v was a truthful young man and \nwould on no account have told a deliberate lie. \nHe began his story meaning to tell everything \njust as it happened, but imperceptibly, invol- \nuntarily, and inevitably he lapsed into false- \nhood. If he had told the truth to his hearers \nwho like himself had often heard stories of at- \ntacks and had formed a definite idea of what \nan attack was and were expecting to hear just \nsuch a story they would either not have be- \nlieved him or, still worse, would have thought \nthat Rostov was himself to blame since what \ngenerally happens to the narrators of cavalry \nattacks had not happened to him. He could \nnot tell them simply that everyone went at a \ntrot and that he fell off his horse and sprained \nhis arm and then ran as hard as he could from \na Frenchman into the wood. Besides, to tell \neverything as it really happened, it would have \nbeen necessary to make an effort of will to tell \nonly what happened. It is very difficult to tell \nthe truth, and young people are rarely capable \nof it. His hearers expected a story of how be- \nside himself and all aflame with excitement, he \nhad flown like a storm at the square, cut his \nway in, slashed right and left, how his saber \n\n\n\nhad tasted flesh and he had fallen exhausted, \nand so on. And so he told them all that. \n\nIn the middle of his story, just as he was \nsaying: "You cannot imagine what a strange \nfrenzy one experiences duringanattack/'Prince \nAndrew, whom Boris was expecting, entered \nthe room. Prince Andrew, who liked to help \nyoung men, was flattered by being asked for \nhis assistance and being well disposed toward \nBoris, who had managed to please him the day \nbefore, he wished to do what the young man \nwanted. Having been sent with papers from \nKutii/ov to the Tsardvich, he looked in on \nBoris, hoping to find him alone. When he came \nin and saw an hussar of the line recounting his \nmilitary exploits (Prince Andrew could not \nendure that sort of man), he gave Boris a pleas- \nant smile, frowned as with half-closed eyes \nhe looked at Rost6v, bowed slightly and wea- \nrily, and sat down languidly on the sofa: he \nfelt it unpleasant to have dropped in on bad \ncompany. Rostov flushed up on noticing this, \nbut he did not care, this was a mere stran- \nger. Glancing, however, at Boris, he saw that \nhe too seemed ashamed of the hussar of the \nline. \n\nIn spite of Prince Andrew's disagreeable, \nironical tone, in spite of the contempt with \nwhich Rostov, from his fighting army point of \nview, regarded all these little adjutants on the \nstaff, of whom the newcomer was evidently one, \nRost6v felt confused, blushed, and became si- \nlent. Boris inquired what news there might be \non the staff, and what, without indiscretion, \none might ask about our plans. \n\n"We shall probably advance," replied Bol- \nk6nski, evidently reluctant to say more in the \npresence of a stranger. \n\nBerg took the opportunity to ask, with great \npoliteness, whether, as was rumored, the allow- \nance of forage money to captains of companies \nwould be doubled. To this Prince Andrew an- \nswered with a smile that he could give no \nopinion on such an important government or- \nder, and Berg laughed gaily. \n\n"As to your business," Prince Andrew con- \ntinued, addressing Boris, "we will talk of it \nlater" (and he looked round at Rost6v). "Come \nto me after the review and we will do what is \npossible." \n\nAnd, having glanced round the room, Prince \nAndrew turned to Rostov, whose state of \nunconquerable childish embarrassment now \nchanging to anger he did not condescend to \nnotice, and said: "I think you were talking of \nthe Schon Grabern affair? Were you there?" \n\n\n\nBOOK THREE \n\n\n\n"I was there," said Rost6v angrily, as if in- \ntending to insult the aide-de-camp. \n\nBolk6nski noticed the hussar's state of mind, \nand it amused him. With a slightly contemptu- \nous smile, he said: "Yes, there are many stories \nnow told about that affair!" \n\n"Yes, stories!" repeated Rost6v loudly, look- \ning with eyes suddenly grown furious, now at \nBoris, now at Bolk6nski. "Yes, many stories! \nBut our stories are the stories of men who have \nbeen under the enemy's fire! Our stories have \nsome weight, not like the stories of those fel- \nlows on the staff who get rewards without do- \ning anything!" \n\n"Of whom you imagine me to be one?" said \nPrince Andrew, with a quiet and particularly \namiable smile. \n\nA strange feeling of exasperation and yet of \nrespect for this man's self-possession mingled \nat that moment in Rost6v's soul. \n\n"I am not talking about you," he said, "I \ndon't know you and, frankly, I don't want to. \nI am speaking of the staff in general." \n\n"And I will tell you this," Prince Andrew in- \nterrupted in a tone of quiet authority, "you \nwish to insult me, and I am ready to agree with \nyou that it would be very easy to do so if you \nhaven't sufficient self-respect, but admit that \nthe time and place are very badly chosen. In a \nday or two we shall all have to take part in a \ngreater and more serious duel, and besides, \nDrubetsk6y, who says he is an old friend of \nyours, is not at all to blame that my face has \nthe misfortune to displease you. However," he \nadded rising, "you know my name and where \nto find me, but don't forget that I do not re- \ngard either myself or you as having been at all \ninsulted, and as a man older than you, my ad- \nvice is to let the matter drop. Well then, on \nFriday after the review I shall expect you, \nDrubetsk6y. Au revoir!" exclaimed Prince An- \ndrew, and with a bow to them both he went \nout. \n\nOnly when Prince Andrew was gone did \nRost6v think of what he ought to have said. \nAnd he was still more angry at having omitted \nto say it. He ordered his horse at once and, \ncoldly taking leave of Boris, rode home. Should \nhe go to headquarters next day and challenge \nthat affected adjutant, or really let the matter \ndrop, was the question that worried him all \nthe way. He thought angrily of the pleasure he \nwould have at seeing the fright of that small \nand frail but proud man when covered by his \npistol, and then he felt with surprise that of \nall the men he knew there was none he would \n\n\n\nso much like to have for a friend as that very \nadjutant whom he so hated. \n\nCHAPTER VIII \n\nTHE DAY AFTER Rost6v had been to see Boris, \na review was held of the Austrian and Russian \ntroops, both those freshly arrived from Russia \nand those who had been campaigning under \nKutuzov. The two Emperors, the Russian with \nhis heir the Tsardvich, and the Austrian with \nthe Archduke, inspected the allied army of \neighty thousand men. \n\nFrom early morning the smart clean troops \nwere on the move, forming up on the field be- \nfore the fortress. Now thousands of feet and \nbayonets moved and halted at the officers' com- \nmand, turned with banners flying, formed up \nat intervals, and wheeled round other similar \nmasses of infantry in different uniforms; now \nwas heard the rhythmic beat of hoofs and the \njingling of showy cavalry in blue, red, and \ngreen braided uniforms, with smartly dressed \nbandsmen in front mounted on black, roan, or \ngray horses; then again, spreading out with the \nbrazen clatter of the polished shining cannon \nthat quivered on the gun carriages and with \nthe smell of linstocks, came the artillery which \ncrawled between the infantry and cavalry and \ntook up its appointed position. Not only the \ngenerals in full parade uniforms, with their \nthin or thick waists drawn in to the utmost, \ntheir red necks squeezed into their stiff collars, \nand wearing scarves and all their decorations, \nnot only the elegant, pomaded officers, but \nevery soldier with his freshly washed and \nshaven face and his weapons clean and pol- \nished to the utmost, and every horse groomed \ntill its coat shone like satin and every hair of \nits wetted mane lay smooth felt that no small \nmatter was happening, but an important and \nsolemn affair. Every general and every soldier \nwas conscious of his own insignificance, aware \nof being but a drop in that ocean of men, and \nyet at thesame time was conscious of his strength \nas a part of that enormous whole. \n\nFrom early morning strenuous activities and \nefforts had begun and by ten o'clock all had \nbeen brought into due order. The ranks were \ndrown up on the vast field. The whole army \nwas extended in three lines: the cavalry in \nfront, behind it the artillery, and behind that \nagain the infantry. \n\nA space like a street was left between each \ntwo lines of troops. The three parts of that \narmy were sharply distinguished: Kutiizov's \nfighting army (with the Pdvlograds on the right \n\n\n\n136 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nflank of the front); those recently arrived from \nRussia, both Guards and regiments of the line; \nand the Austrian troops. But they all stood in \nthe same lines, under one command, and in a \nlike order. \n\nLike wind over leaves ran an excited \nwhisper: "They're coming! They're com- \ning!" Alarmed voices were heard, and a \nstir of final preparation swept over all the \ntroops. \n\nFrom the direction of Olmiitz in front of \nthem, a group was seen approaching. And at \nthat moment, though the day was still, a light \ngust of wind blowing over the army slightly \nstirred the streamers on the lances and the un- \nfolded standards fluttered against their staffs. \nIt looked as if by that slight motion the army \nitself was expressing its joy at the approach of \nthe Emperors. One voice was heard shouting: \n"Eyes front!" Then, like the crowing of cocks \nat sunrise, this was repeated by others from \nvarious sides and all became silent. \n\nIn the deathlike stillness only the tramp of \nhorses was heard. This was the Emperors' suites. \nThe Emperors rode up to the flank, and the \ntrumpets of the first cavalry regiment played \nthe general march. It seemed as though not the \ntrumpeters were playing, but as if the army it- \nself, rejoicing at the Emperors' approach, had \nnaturally burst into music. Amid these sounds, \nonly the youthful kindly voice of the Emperor \nAlexander was clearly heard. He gave the words \nof greeting, and the first regiment roared "Hur- \nrah!" so deafeningly, continuously, and joy- \nfully that the men themselves were awed by \ntheir multitude and the immensity of the pow- \ner they constituted. \n\nRostov, standing in the front lines of Kutu- \nzov's army which the Tsar approached first, ex- \nperienced the same feeling as every other man \nin that army: a feeling of self-forgetfulness, a \nproud consciousness of might, and a passion- \nate attraction to him who was the cause of this \ntriumph. \n\nHe felt that at a single word from that man \nall this vast mass (and he himself an insignifi- \ncant atom in it) would go through fire and \nwater, commit crime, die, or perform deeds of \nhighest heroism, and so he could not but trem- \nble and his heart stand still at the imminence \nof that word. \n\n"Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!" thundered \nfrom all sides, one regiment after another greet- \ning the Tsar with the strains of the march, and \nthen "Hurrah!" . . . Then the general march, \nand again "Hurrah! Hurrah!" growing ever \n\n\n\nstronger and fuller and merging into a deafen- \ning roar. \n\nTill the Tsar reached it, each regiment in its \nsilence and immobility seemed like a lifeless \nbody, but as soon as he came up it became \nalive, its thunder joining the roar of the whole \nline along which he had already passed. \nThrough the terrible and deafening roar of \nthose voices, amid the square masses of troops \nstanding motionless as if turned to stone, hun- \ndreds of riders composing the suites moved \ncarelessly but symmetrically and above all free- \nly, and in front of them two men the Emper- \nors. Upon them the undivided, tensely passion- \nate attention of that whole mass of men was \nconcentrated. \n\nThe handsome young Emperor Alexander, \nin the uniform of the Horse Guards, wearing \na cocked hat with its peaks front and back, \nwith his pleasant face and resonant though not \nloud voice, attracted everyone's attention. \n\nRostov was not far from the trumpeters, and \nwith his keen sight had recognized the Tsar \nand watched his approach. When he was with- \nin twenty paces, and Nicholas could clearly \ndistinguish every detail of his handsome, hap- \npy young face, he experienced a feeling of tend- \nerness and ecstasy such as he had never be- \nfore known. Every trait and every movement \nof the Tsar's seemed to him enchanting. \n\nStopping in front of the Pdvlograds, the Tsar \nsaid something in French to the Austrian Em- \nperor and smiled. \n\nSeeing that smile, Rost6v involuntarily smiled \nhimself and felt a still stronger flow of love \nfor his sovereign. He longed to show that love \nin some way and knowing that this was impos- \nsible was ready to cry. The Tsar called the colo- \nnel of the regiment and said a few words to \nhim. \n\n"Oh God, what would happen to me if the \nEmperor spoke to me?" thought Rost6v. "I \nshould die of happiness!" \n\nThe Tsar addressed the officers also: "I thank \nyou all, gentlemen, I thank you with my whole \nheart." To Rost6v every word sounded like a \nvoice from heaven. How gladly would he have \ndied at once for his Tsar! \n\n"You have earned the St. George's standards \nand will be worthy of them." \n\n"Oh, to die, to die for him!" thought Rost6v. \n\nThe Tsar said something more which Ros- \nt6v did not hear, and the soldiers, straining \ntheir lungs, shouted "Hurrah!" \n\nRost6v too, bending over his saddle, shouted \n"Hurrah!" with all his might, feeling that he \n\n\n\nBOOK \n\nwould like to injure himself by that shout, if \nonly to express his rapture fully. \n\nThe Tsar stopped a few minutes in front of \nthe hussars as if undecided. \n\n"How can the Emperor be undecided?" \nthought Rost6v, but then even this indecision \nappeared to him majestic and enchanting, like \neverything else the Tsar did. \n\nThat hesitation lasted only an instant. The \nTsar's foot, in the narrow pointed boot then \nfashionable, touched the groin of the bobtailed \nbay mare he rode, his hand in a white glove \ngathered up the reins, and he moved off accom- \npanied by an irregularly swaying sea of aides- \nde-camp. Farther and farther he rode away, \nstopping at other regiments, till at last only \nhis white plumes were visible to Rost6v from \namid the suites that surrounded the Emperors. \n\nAmong the gentlemen of the suite, Rost6v \nnoticed Bolk6nski, sitting his horse indolently \nand carelessly. Rost6v recalled their quarrel of \nyesterday and the question presented itself \nwhether he ought or ought not to challenge \nBolk6nski. "Of course not!" he now thought. \n"Is it worth thinking or speaking of it at such \na moment? At a time of such love, such rap- \nture, and such self-sacrifice, what do any of our \nquarrels and affronts matter? I love and for- \ngive everybody now." \n\nWhen the Emperor had passed nearly all \nthe regiments, the troops began a ceremonial \nmarch past him, and Rost6v on Bedouin, re- \ncently purchased from Denfsov, rode past too, \nat the rear of his squadron that is, alone and \nin full view of the Emperor. \n\nBefore he reached him, Rost6v, who was a \nsplendid horseman, spurred Bedouin twice \nand successfully put him to the showy trot in \nwhich the animal went when excited. Bend- \ning his foaming muzzle to his chest, his tail ex- \ntended, Bedouin, as if also conscious of the \nEmperor's eye upon him, passed splendidly, \nlifting his feet with a high and graceful action, \nas if flying through the air without touching \nthe ground. \n\nRost6v himself, his legs well back and his \nstomach drawn in and feeling himself one with \nhis horse, rode past the Emperor with a frown- \ning but blissful face "like a vewy devil," as \nDenfsov expressed it. \n\n"Fine fellows, the Pdvlogradsl" remarked \nthe Emperor. \n\n"My God, how happy I should be if he or- \ndered me to leap into the fire this instant!" \nthought Rost6v. \n\nWhen the review was over, the newly ar- \n\n\n\nTHREE 137 \n\nrived officers, and also Kuttizov's, collected in \ngroups and began to talk about the awards, \nabout the Austrians and their uniforms, about \ntheir lines, about Bonaparte, and how badly \nthe latter would fare now, especially if the Es- \nsen corps arrived and Prussia took our side. \n\nBut the talk in every group was chiefly about \nthe Emperor Alexander. His every word and \nmovement was described with ecstasy. \n\nThey all had but one wish: to advance as \nsoon as possible against the enemy under the \nEmperor's command. Commanded by the Em- \nperor himself they could not fail to vanquish \nanyone, be it whom it might: so thought Ros- \ntov and most of the officers after the review. \n\nAll were then more confident of victory than \nthe winning of two battles would have made \nthem. \n\nCHAPTER IX \n\nTHE DAY AFTER the review, Boris, in his best \nuniform and with his comrade Berg's best \nwishes for success, rode to Olmiitz to see Bol- \nkonski, wishing to profit by his friendliness and \nobtain for himself the best post he could pref- \nerably that of adjutant to some important \npersonage, a position in the army which seemed \nto him most attractive. "It is all very well for \nRost6v, whose father sends him ten thousand \nrubles at a time, to talk about not wishing to \ncringe to anybody and not be anyone's lackey, \nbut I who have nothing but my brains have to \nmake a career and must not miss opportunities, \nbut must avail myself of them!" he reflected. \n\nHe did not find Prince Andrew in Olmiitz \nthat day, but the appearance of the town where \nthe headquarters and the diplomatic corps \nwere stationed and the two Emperors were \nliving with their suites, households, and courts \nonly strengthened his desire to belong to that \nhigher world. \n\nHe knew no one, and despite his smart \nGuardsman's uniform, all these exalted per- \nsonages passing in the streets in their elegant \ncarriages with their plumes, ribbons, and med- \nals, both courtiers and military men, seemed \nso immeasurably above him, an insignificant \nofficer of the Guards, that they not only did \nnot wish to, but simply could not, be aware of \nhis existence. At the quarters of the command- \ner in chief, Kutiizov, where he inquired for \nBolk6nski, all the adjutants and even the or- \nderlies looked at him as if they wished to im- \npress on him that a great many officers like \nhim were always coming there and that every- \nbody was heartily sick of them. In spite of this, \n\n\n\n138 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nor rather because of it, next day, November 15, \nafter dinner he again went to Olmiitz and, en- \ntering the house occupied by Kutiizov, asked \nfor Bolk6nski. Prince Andrew was in and Boris \nwas shown into a large hall probably formerly \nused for dancing, but in which five beds now \nstood, and furniture of various kinds: a table, \nchairs, and a clavichord. One adjutant, near- \nest the door, was sitting at the table in a Per- \nsian dressing gown, writing. Another, the red, \nstout Nesvitski, lay on a bed with his arms un- \nder his head, laughing with an officer who had \nsat down beside him. A third was playing a Vi- \nennese waltz on the clavichord, while a fourth, \nlying on the clavichord, sang the tune. Bol- \nk6nski was not there. None of these gentlemen \nchanged his position on seeing Boris. The one \nwho was writing and whom Boris addressed \nturned round crossly and told him Bolk6nski \nwas on duty and that he should go through the \ndoor on the left into the reception room if he \nwished to see him. Boris thanked him and went \nto the reception room, where he found some \nten officers and generals. \n\nWhen he entered, Prince Andrew, his eyes \ndrooping contemptuously (with that peculiar \nexpression of polite weariness which plainly \nsays, "If it were not my duty I would not talk \nto you for a moment"), was listening to an old \nRussian general with decorations, who stood \nvery erect, almost on tiptoe, with a soldier's \nobsequious expression on his purple face, re- \nporting something. \n\n"Very well, then, be so good as to wait," said \nPrince Andrew to the general, in Russian, \nspeaking with the French intonation he affect- \ned when he wished to speak contemptuously, \nand noticing Boris, Prince Andrew, paying no \nmore heed to the general who ran after him \nimploring him to hear something more, nod- \nded and turned to him with a cheerful smile. \n\nAt that moment Boris clearly realized what \nhe had before surmised, that in the army, be- \nsides the subordination and discipline pre- \nscribed in the military code, which he and the \nothers knew in the regiment, there was another, \nmore important, subordination, which made \nthis tight-laced, purple-faced general wait re- \nspectfully while Captain Prince Andrew, for his \nown pleasure, chose to chat with Lieutenant \nDrubetsk6y. More than ever was Boris re- \nsolved to serve in future not according to the \nwritten code, but under this unwritten law. \nHe felt now that merely by having been rec- \nommended to Prince Andrew he had already \nrisen above the general who at the front had \n\n\n\nthe power to annihilate him, a lieutenant of \nthe Guards. Prince Andrew came up to him \nand took his hand. \n\n"I am very sorry you did not find me in yes- \nterday. I was fussing about with Germans all \nday. We went with Weyrother to survey the \ndispositions. When Germans start being ac- \ncurate, there's no end to it I" \n\nBoris smiled, as if he understood what Prince \nAndrew was alluding to as something general- \nly known. But it was the first time he had heard \nWeyrother's name, or even the term "disposi- \ntions." \n\n"Well, my dear fellow, so you still want to \nbe an adjutant? I have been thinking about \nyou." \n\n"Yes, I was thinking" for some reason Boris \ncould not help blushing "of asking the com- \nmander in chief. He has had a letter from \nPrince Kurdgin about me. I only wanted to \nask because I fear the Guards won't be in ac- \ntion," he added as if in apology. \n\n"All right, all right. We'll talk it over," re- \nplied Prince Andrew. "Only let me report this \ngentleman's business, and I shall be at your \ndisposal." \n\nWhile Prince Andrew went to report about \nthe purple-faced general, that gentleman evi- \ndently not sharing Boris' conception of the ad- \nvantages of the unwritten code of subordina- \ntionlooked so fixedly at the presumptuous \nlieutenant who had prevented his finishing \nwhat he had to say to the adjutant that Boris \nfelt uncomfortable. He turned away and waited \nimpatiently for Prince Andrew's return from \nthe commander in chief's room. \n\n"You see, my dear fellow, I have been think- \ning about you," said Prince Andrew when they \nhad gone into the large room where the clavi- \nchord was. "It's no use your going to the com- \nmander in chief. He would say a lot of pleas- \nant things, ask you to dinner" ("That would \nnot be bad as regards the unwritten code," \nthought Boris), "but nothing more would come \nof it. There will soon be a battalion of us aides- \nde-camp and adjutants! But this is what we'll \ndo: I have a good friend, an adjutant general \nand an excellent fellow, Prince Dolgorukov; \nand though you may not know it, the fact is \nthat now Kutiizov with his staff and all of us \ncount for nothing. Everything is now centered \nround the Emperor. So we will go to Dolgoru- \nkov; I have to go there anyhow and I have al- \nready spoken to him about you. We shall see \nwhether he cannot attach you to himself or \nfind a place for you somewhere nearer the sun." \n\n\n\nPrince Andrew always became specially keen \nwhen he had to guide a young man and help \nhim to worldly success. Under cover of obtain- \ning help of this kind for another, which from \npride he would never accept for himself, he \nkept in touch with the circle which confers suc- \ncess and which attracted him. He very readily \ntook up Boris' cause and went with him to Dol- \ngoriikov. \n\nIt was late in the evening when they entered \nthe palace at Olmiitz occupied by the Emper- \nors and their retinues. \n\nThat same day a council of war had been \nheld in which all the members of the Hof- \nkriegsrath and both Emperors took part. At \nthat council, contrary to the views of the old \ngenerals Kutiizov and Prince Schwartzenberg, \nit had been decided to advance immediately \nand give battle to Bonaparte. The council of \nwar was just over when Prince Andrew accom- \npanied by Boris arrived at the palace to find \nDolgorukov. Everyone at headquarters was still \nunder the spell of the day's council, at which \nthe party of the young had triumphed. The \nvoices of those who counseled delay and ad- \nvised waiting for something else before advanc- \ning had been so completely silenced and their \narguments confuted by such conclusive evi- \ndence of the advantages of attacking that what \nhad been discussed at the council the coming \nbattle and the victory that would certainly re- \nsult from it no longer seemed to be in the \nfuture but in the past. All the advantages were \non our side. Our enormous forces, undoubted- \nly superior to Napoleon's, were concentrated \nin one place, the troops inspired by the Em- \nperors' presence were eager for action. The \nstrategic position where the operations would \ntake place was familiar in all its details to the \nAustrian General Weyrother: a lucky accident \nhad ordained that the Austrian army should \nmaneuver the previous year on the very fields \nwhere the French had now to be fought; the \nadjacent locality was known and shown in \nevery detail on the maps, and Bonaparte, evi- \ndently weakened, was undertaking nothing. \n\nDolgorukov, one of the warmest advocates \nof an attack, had just returned from the coun- \ncil, tired and exhausted but eager and proud \nof the victory that had been gained. Prince \nAndrew introduced his prot^g^, but Prince \nDolgonikov politely and firmly pressing his \nhand said nothing to Boris and, evidently un- \nable to suppress the thoughts which were up- \npermost in his mind at that moment, addressed \nPrince Andrew in French, \n\n\n\nBOOK THREE 139 \n\n"Ah, my dear fellow, what a battle we have \n\n\n\ngained! God grant that the one that will result \nfrom it will be as victorious! However, my dear \nfellow," he said abruptly and eagerly, "I must \nconfess to having been unjust to the Austrians \nand especially to Weyrother. What exactitude, \nwhat minuteness, what knowledge of the local- \nity, what foresight for every eventuality, every \npossibility even to the smallest detail 1 No, my \ndear fellow, no conditions better than our pres- \nent ones could have been devised. This combi- \nnation of Austrian precision with Russian val- \norwhat more could be wished for?" \n\n"So the attack is definitely resolved on?" \nasked Bolk6nski. \n\n"And do you know, my dear fellow, it seems \nto me that Bonaparte has decidedly lost his \nbearings, you know that a letter was received \nfrom him today for the Emperor." Dolgorukov \nsmiled significantly. \n\n"Is that so? And what did he say?" inquired \nBolkonski. \n\n"What can he say? Tra-di-ri-di-ra and so on \n. . . merely to gain time. I tell you he is in our \nhands, that's certain! But what was most amus- \ning," he continued, with a sudden, good-na- \ntured laugh, "was that we could not think how \nto address the reply! If not as 'Consul' and of \ncourse not as 'Emperor,' it seemed to me it \nshould be to 'General Bonaparte.' " \n\n"But between not recognizing him as Em- \nperor and calling him General Bonaparte, \nthere is a difference," remarked Bolk6nski. \n\n"That's just it," interrupted Dolgoriikov \nquickly, laughing. "You know Bilfbin he's a \nvery clever fellow. He suggested addressing \nhim as 'Usurper and Enemy of Mankind.' " \n\nDolgorukov laughed merrily. \n\n"Only that?" said Bolk6nski. \n\n"All the same, it was Bilibin who found a \nsuitable form for the address. He is a wise and \nclever fellow." \n\n"What was it?" \n\n"To the Head of the French Government \n. . . Au chef du gouvernement franfais," said \nDolgorukov, with grave satisfaction. "Good, \nwasn't it?" \n\n"Yes, but he will dislike it extremely," said \nBolk6nski. \n\n"Oh yes, very much! My brother knows him, \nhe's dined with him the present Emperor- \nmore than once in Paris, and tells me he never \nmet a more cunning or subtle diplomatist \nyou know, a combination of French adroitness \nand Italian play-acting! Do you know the tale \nabout him and Count Mark6v? Count Mark6v \n\n\n\n140 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nwas the only man who knew how to handle \nhim. You know the story of the handkerchief? \nIt is delightful!" \n\nAnd the talkative Dolgorukov, turning now \nto Boris, now to Prince Andrew, told how \nBonaparte wishing to test Mark6v, our ambas- \nsador, purposely dropped a handkerchief in \nfront of him and stood looking at Mark6v, \nprobably expecting Mark6v to pick it up for \nhim, and how Mark6v immediately dropped \nhis own beside it and picked it up without \ntouching Bonaparte's. \n\n"Delightful!" said Bolk6nski. "But I have \ncome to you, Prince, as a petitioner on behalf \nof this young man. You see . . ." but before \nPrince Andrew could finish, an aide-de-camp \ncame in to summon Dolgorukov to the Emper- \nor. \n\n"Oh, what a nuisance," said Dolgorukov, \ngetting up hurriedly and pressing the hands of \nPrince Andrew and Boris. "You know I should \nbe very glad to do all in my power both for you \nand for this dear young man." Again he pressed \nthe hand of the latter with an expression of \ngood-natured, sincere, and animated levity. \n"But you see . . . another time!" \n\nBoris was excited by the thought of being so \nclose to the higher powers as he felt himself to \nbe at that moment. He was conscious that here \nhe was in contact with the springs that set in \nmotion the enormous movements of the mass \nof which in his regiment he felt himself a tiny, \nobedient, and insignificant atom. They fol- \nlowed Prince Dolgorukov out into the corri- \ndor and met coming out of the door of the \nEmperor's room by which Dolgoriikov had en- \ntereda short man in civilian clothes with a \nclever face and sharply projecting jaw which, \nwithout spoiling his face, gave him a peculiar \nvivacity and shiftiness of expression. This short \nman nodded to Dolgorukov as to an intimate \nfriend and stared at Prince Andrew with cool \nintensity, walking straight toward him and \nevidently expecting him to bow or to step out \nof his way. Prince Andrew did neither: a look \nof animosity appeared on his face and the oth- \ner turned away and went down the side of the \ncorridor. \n\n"Who was that?" asked Boris. \n\n"He is one of the most remarkable, but to \nme most unpleasant of men the Minister of \nForeign Affairs, Prince Adam Czartoryski. . . . \nIt is such men as he who decide the fate of \nnations," added Bolk6nski with a sigh he \ncould not suppress, as they passed out of the \npalace. \n\n\n\nNext day, the army began its campaign, and \nup to tl\e very battle of Austerlitz, Boris was \nunable to see either Prince Andrew or Dol- \ngoriikov again and remained for a while with \nthe Ismdylov regiment. \n\nCHAPTER X \n\nAT DAWN on the sixteenth of November, Denf- \nsov's squadron, in which Nicholas Rost6v served \nand which was in Prince Bagrati6n's detach- \nment, moved from the place where it had \nspent the night, advancing into action as ar- \nranged, and after going behind other columns \nfor about two thirds of a mile was stopped on \nthe highroad. Rost6v saw the Cossacks and \nthen the first and second squadrons of hussars \nand infantry battalions and artillery pass by \nand go forward and then Generals Bagrati6n \nand Dolgorukov ride past with their adjutants. \nAll the fear before action which he had experi- \nenced as previously, all the inner struggle to \nconquer that fear, all his dreams of distin- \nguishing himself as a true hussar in this battle, \nhad been wasted. Their squadron remained in \nreserve and Nicholas Rost6v spent that day in \na dull and wretched mood. At nine in the morn- \ning, he heard firing in front and shouts of hur- \nrah, and saw wounded being brought back \n(there were not many of them), and at last he \nsaw how a whole detachment of French caval- \nry was brought in, convoyed by a sdtnya of \nCossacks. Evidently the affair was over and, \nthough not big, had been a successful engage- \nment. The men and officers returning spoke \nof a brilliant victory, of the occupation of the \ntown of Wischau and the capture of a whole \nFrench squadron. The day was bright and sun- \nny after a sharp night frost, and the cheerful \nglitter of that autumn day was in keeping with \nthe news of victory which was conveyed, not \nonly by the tales of those who had taken part \nin it, but also by the joyful expression on the \nfaces of soldiers, officers, generals, and adju- \ntants, as they passed Rostov going or coming. \nAnd Nicholas, who had vainly suffered all the \ndread that precedes a battle and had spent \nthat happy day in inactivity, was all the more \ndepressed. \n\n"Come here, Wost6v. Let's dwink to dwown \nour gwief!" shouted Denisov, who had settled \ndown by the roadside with a flask and some \nfood. \n\nThe officers gathered round Denfsov's can- \nteen, eating and talking. \n\n"There! They are bringing another!" cried \none of the officers, indicating a captive French \n\n\n\nBOOK THREE \n\n\n\n141 \n\n\n\ndragoon who was being brought in on foot by \ntwo Cossacks. \n\nOne of them was leading by the bridle a fine \nlarge French horse he had taken from the pris- \noner. \n\n"Sell us that horse!" Denfsov called out to \nthe Cossacks. \n\n"If you like, your honor!" \n\nThe officers got up and stood round the Cos- \nsacks and their prisoner. The French dragoon \nwas a young Alsatian who spoke French with a \nGerman accent. He was breathless with agita- \ntion, his face was red, and when he heard some \nFrench spoken he at once began speaking to \nthe officers, addressing first one, then another. \nHe said he would not have been taken, it was \nnot his fault but the corporal's who had sent \nhim to seize some horsecloths, though he had \ntold him the Russians were there. And at every \nword he added: "But don't hurt my little \nhorse!" and stroked the animal. It was plain \nthat he did not quite grasp where he was. Now \nhe excused himself for having been taken pris- \noner and now, imagining himself before his \nown officers, insisted on his soldierly discipline \nand zeal in the service. He brought with him \ninto our rearguard all the freshness of atmos- \nphere of the French army, which was so alien \nto us. \n\nThe Cossacks sold the horse for two gold \npieces, and Rost6v, being the richest of the of- \nficers now that he had received his money, \nbought it. \n\n"But don't hurt my little horse!" said the \nAlsatian good-naturedly to Rost6v when the \nanimal was handed over to the hussar. \n\nRost6v smilingly reassured the dragoon and \ngave him money. \n\n"Alley! Alley!" said the Cossack, touching \nthe prisoner's arm to make him go on. \n\n"The Emperor! The Emperor!" was sud- \ndenly heard among the hussars. \n\nAll began to run and bustle, and Rost6v saw \ncoming up the road behind him several riders \nwith white plumes in their hats. In a moment \neveryone was in his place, waiting. \n\nRost6v did not know or remember how he \nran to his place and mounted. Instantly his re- \ngret at not having been in action and his de- \njected mood amid people of whom he was \nweary had gone, instantly every thought of \nhimself had vanished. He was filled with hap- \npiness at his nearness to the Emperor. He felt \nthat this nearness by itself made up to him for \nthe day he had lost. He was happy as a lover \nwhen the longed-for moment of meeting ar- \n\n\n\nrives. Not daring to look round and without \nlooking round, he was ecstatically conscious \nof his approach. He felt it not only from the \nsound of the hoofs of the approaching caval- \ncade, but because as he drew near everything \ngrew brighter, more joyful, more significant, \nand more festive around him. Nearer and near- \ner to Rost6v came that sun shedding beams of \nmild and majestic light around, and already \nhe felt himself enveloped in those beams, he \nheard his voice, that kindly, calm, and majestic \nvoice that was yet so simple! And as if in ac- \ncord with Rostov's feeling, there was a deathly \nstillness amid which was heard the Emperor's \nvoice. \n\n"The Pavlograd hussars?" he inquired. \n\n"The reserves, sire!" replied a voice, a very \nhuman one compared to that which had said: \n"The Pdvlograd hussars?" \n\nThe Emperor drew level with Rostov and \nhalted. Alexander's face was even more beau- \ntiful than it had been three days before at the \nreview. It shone with such gaiety and youth, \nsuch innocent youth, that it suggested the live- \nliness of a fourteen-year-old boy, and yet it was \nthe face of the majestic Emperor. Casually, \nwhile surveying the squadron, the Emperor's \neyes met Rostov's and rested on them for not \nmore than two seconds. Whether or no the \nEmperor understood what was going on in \nRostov's soul (it seemed to Rostov that he un- \nderstood everything), at any rate his light-blue \neyes gazed for about two seconds into Rost6v's \nface. A gentle, mild light poured from them. \nThen all at once he raised his eyebrows, ab- \nruptly touched his horse with his left foot, and \ngalloped on. \n\nThe younger Emperor could not restrain his \nwish to be present at the battle and, in spite \nof the remonstrances of his courtiers, at twelve \no'clock left the third column with which he \nhad been and galloped toward the vanguard. \nBefore he came up with the hussars, several \nadjutants met him with news of the successful \nresult of the action. \n\nThis battle, which consisted in the capture \nof a French squadron, was represented as a \nbrilliant victory over the French, and so the \nEmperor and the whole army, especially while \nthe smoke hung over the battlefield, believed \nthat the French had been defeated and were \nretreating against their will. A few minutes \nafter the Emperor had passed, the Pavlograd \ndivision was ordered to advance. In Wischau \nitself, a petty German town, Rostov saw the \nEmperor again. In the market place, where \n\n\n\n142 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nthere had been some rather heavy firing before \nthe Emperor's arrival, lay several killed and \nwounded soldiers whom there had not been \ntime to move. The Emperor, surrounded by \nhis suite of officers and courtiers, was riding a \nbobtailed chestnut mare, a different one from \nthat which he had ridden at the review, and \nbending to one side he gracefully held a gold \nlorgnette to his eyes and looked at a soldier \nwho lay prone, with blood on his uncovered \nhead. The wounded soldier was so dirty, coarse, \nand revolting that his proximity to the Emper- \nor shocked Rostov. Rost6v saw how the Em- \nperor's rather round shoulders shuddered as \nif a cold shiver had run down them, how his \nleft foot began convulsively tapping the horse's \nside with the spur, and how the well-trained \nhorse looked round unconcerned and did not \nstir. An adjutant, dismounting, lifted the sol- \ndier under the arms to place him on a stretch- \ner that had been brought. The soldier groaned. \n\n"Gently, gentlyl Can't you do it more gent- \nly?" said the Emperor apparently suffering \nmore than the dying soldier, and he rode away. \n\nRostov saw tears filling the Emperor's eyes \nand heard him, as he was riding away, say to \nCzartoryski: "What a terrible thing war is: \nwhat a terrible thing! Quelle terrible chose \nque la guerre!" \n\nThe troops of the vanguard were stationed \nbefore Wischau, within sight of the enemy's \nlines, which all day long had yielded ground to \nus at the least firing. The Emperor's gratitude \nwas announced to the vanguard, rewards were \npromised, and the men received a double ra- \ntion of vodka. The campfires crackled and the \nsoldiers' songs resounded even more merrily \nthan on theprevious night. Denisov celebrated \nhis promotion to the rank of major, and Ros- \nt6v, who had already drunk enough, at the end \nof the feast proposed the Emperor's health. \n"Not 'our Sovereign, the Emperor,' as they say \nat official dinners," said he, "but the health of \nour Sovereign, that good, enchanting, and great \nman! Let us drink to his health and to the cer- \ntain defeat of the French! \n\n"If we fought before," he said, "not letting \nthe French pass, as at Schon Grabern, what \nshall we not do now when he is at the front? \nWe will all die for him gladly! Is it not so, gen- \ntlemen? Perhaps I am not saying it right, I \nhave drunk a good dealbut that is how I feel, \nand so do you too! To the health of Alexander \nthe First! Hurrah!" \n\n"Hurrah!" rang the enthusiastic voices of \nthe officers. \n\n\n\nAnd the old cavalry captain, Kfrsten, shouted \nenthusiastically and no less sincerely than the \ntwenty-year-old Rost6v. \n\nWhen the officers had emptied and smashed \ntheir glasses, Kirsten filled others and, in shirt \nsleeves and breeches, went glass in hand to the \nsoldiers' bonfires and with his long gray mus- \ntache, his white chest showing under his open \nshirt, he stood in a majestic pose in the light of \nthe campfire, waving his uplifted arm. \n\n"Lads! here's to our Sovereign, the Emper- \nor, and victory over our enemies! Hurrah!" he \nexclaimed in his dashing, old, hussar's bari- \ntone. \n\nThe hussars crowded round and responded \nheartily with loud shouts. \n\nLate that night, when all had separated, \nDenfsov with his short hand patted his favor- \nite, Rost6v, on the shoulder. \n\n"As there's no one to fall in love with on \ncampaign, he's fallen in love with the Tsar," \nhe said. \n\n"Denisov, don't make fun of it!" cried Ros- \nt6v. "It is such a lofty, beautiful feeling, such \n\n\n\n"I believe it, I believe it, fwiend, and I share \nand appwove. . . ." \n\n"No, you don't understand!" \n\nAnd Rostov got up and went wandering \namong the campfires, dreaming of what happi- \nness it would be to die not in saving the Em- \nperor's life (he did not even dare to dream of \nthat), but simply to die before his eyes. He \nreally was in love with the Tsar and the glory \nof the Russian arms and the hope of future \ntriumph. And he was not the only man to ex- \nperience that feeling during those memorable \ndays preceding the battle of Austcrlitz: nine \ntenths of the men in the Russian army were \nthen in love, though less ecstatically, with their \nTsar and the glory of the Russian arms. \n\nCHAPTER XI \n\nTHE NEXT DAY the Emperor stopped at Wis- \nchau, and Villier, his physician, was repeated- \nly summoned to see him. At headquarters and \namong the troops near by the news spread that \nthe Emperor was unwell. He ate nothing and \nhad slept badly that night, those around him \nreported. The cause of this indisposition was \nthe strong impression made on his sensitive \nmind by the sight of the killed and wounded. \nAt daybreak on the seventeenth, a French \nofficer who had come with a flag of truce, de- \nmanding an audience with the Russian Em- \nperor, was brought into Wischau from our out- \n\n\n\nBOOK THREE \n\n\n\n143 \n\n\n\nposts. This officer was Savary. The Emperor \nhad only just fallen asleep and so Savary had \nto wait. At midday he was admitted to the Em- \nperor, and an hour later he rode off with Prince \nDolgoriikovtothe advanced post of the French \narmy. \n\nIt was rumored that Savary had been sent to \npropose to Alexander a meeting with Napo- \nleon. To the joy and pride of the whole army, \na personal interview was refused, and instead \nof the Sovereign, Prince Dolgorukov, the vic- \ntor at Wischau, was sent with Savary to negoti- \nate with Napoleon if, contrary to expectations, \nthese negotiations were actuated by a real de- \nsire for peace. \n\nToward evening Dolgorukov came back, \nwent straight to the Tsar, and remained alone \nwith him for a long time. \n\nOn the eighteenth and nineteenth of No- \nvember, the army advanced two days' march \nand the enemy's outposts after a brief inter- \nchange of shots retreated. In the highest army \ncircles from midday on the nineteenth, a great, \nexcitedly bustling activity began whLh lasted \ntill the morning of the twentieth, when the \nmemorable battle of Austerlitz was fought. \n\nTill midday on the nineteenth, the activity \nthe eager talk, running to and fro, and dis- \npatching of adjutants was con fined to the Em- \nperor's headquarters. But on the afternoon of \nthat day, this activity reached Kutiizov's head- \nquarters and the staffs of the commanders of \ncolumns. By evening, the adjutants had spread \nit to all ends and parts of the army, and in the \nnight from the nineteenth to the twentieth, \nthe whole eighty thousand allied troops rose \nfrom their bivouacs to the hum of voices, and \nthe army swayed and started in one enormous \nmass six miles long. \n\nThe concentrated activity which had begun \nat the Emperor's headquarters in the morning \nand had started the whole movement that fol- \nlowed was like the first movement of the main \nwheel of a large tower clock. One wheel slow- \nly moved, another was set in motion, and a \nthird, and wheels began to revolve faster and \nfaster, levers and cogwheels to work, chimes to \nplay, figures to pop out, and the hands to ad- \nvance with regular motion as a result of all \nthat activity. \n\nJust as in the mechanism of a clock, so in \nthe mechanism of the military machine, an im- \npulse once given leads to the final result; and \njust as indifferently quiescent till the moment \nwhen motion is transmitted to them are the \nparts of the mechanism which the impulse has \n\n\n\nnot yet reached. Wheels creak on their axles as \nthe cogs engage one another and the revolving \npulleys whirr with the rapidity of their move- \nment, but a neighboring wheel is as quiet and \nmotionless as though it were prepared to re- \nmain so for a hundred years; but the moment \ncomes when the lever catches it and obeying \nthe impulse that wheel begins to creak and \njoins in the common motion the result and \naim of which are beyond its ken. \n\nJust as in a clock, the result of the compli- \ncated motion of innumerable wheels and pul- \nleys is merely a slow and regular movement of \nthe hands which show the time, so the result \nof all the complicated human activities of \n1 60,000 Russians and French all their passions, \ndesires, remorse, humiliations, sufferings, out- \nbursts of pride, fear, and enthusiasm was only \nthe loss of the battle of Austerlitz, the so-called \nbattle of the three Emperors that is to say, a \nslow movement of the hand on the dial of hu- \nman history. \n\nPrince Andrew was on duty that day and in \nconstant attendance on the commander in \nchief. \n\nAt six in the evening, Kutiizov went to the \nEmperor's headquarters and after staying but \na short time with the Tsar went to see the grand \nmarshal of the court, Count Tolst6y. \n\nBolk6nski took the opportunity to go in to \nget some details of the coming action from \nDolgorukov. He felt that Kutiizov was upset \nand dissatisfied about something and that at \nheadquarters they were dissatisfied with him, \nand also that at the Emperor's headquarters \neveryone adopted toward him the tone of men \nwho know something others do not know: he \ntherefore wished to speak to Dolgorukov. \n\n"Well, how d'you do, my dear fellow?" said \nDolgorukov, who was sitting at tea with Bili- \nbin. "The fete is for tomorrow. How is your \nold fellow? Out of sorts?" \n\n"I won't say he is out of sorts, but I fancy he \nwould like to be heard." \n\n"But they heard him at the council of war \nand will hear him when he talks sense, but to \ntemporize and wait for something now when \nBonaparte fears nothing so much as a general \nbattle is impossible." \n\n"Yes, you have seen him?" said Prince An- \ndrew. "Well, what is Bonaparte like? How did \nhe impress you?" \n\n"Yes, I saw him, and am convinced that he \nfears nothing so much as a general engage- \nment," repeated Dolgonikov, evidently priz- \ning this general conclusion which he had ar- \n\n\n\n144 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nrived at from his interview with Napoleon. "If \nhe weren't afraid of a battle why did he ask for \nthat interview? Why negotiate, and above all \nwhy retreat, when to retreat is so contrary to \nhis method of conducting war? Believe me, he \nis afraid, afraid of a general battle. His hour \nhas come! Mark my words I" \n\n"But tell me, what is he like, eh?" said Prince \nAndrew again. \n\n"He is a man in a gray overcoat, very anxi- \nous that I should call him 'Your Majesty/ but \nwho, to his chagrin, got no title frommel That's \nthe sort of man he is, and nothing more," re- \nplied Dolgoriikov, looking round at Bilibin \nwith a smile. \n\n"Despite my great respect for old Kutiizov," \nhe continued, "we should be a nice set of fel- \nlows if we were to wait about and so give him \na chance to escape, or to trick us, now that we \ncertainly have him in our hands! No, we \nmustn't forget Suv6rov and his rule not to \nput yourself in a position to be attacked, but \nyourself to attack. Believe me in war the en- \nergy of young men often shows the way better \nthan all the experience of old Cunctators." \n\n"But in what position are we going to at- \ntack him? I have been at the outposts today \nand it is impossible to say where his chief \nforces are situated," said Prince Andrew. \n\nHe wished to explain to Dolgoriikov a plan \nof attack he had himself formed. \n\n"Oh, that is all the same," Dolgoriikov said \nquickly, and getting up he spread a map on \nthe table. "All eventualities have been fore- \nseen. If he is standing before Brunn . . ." \n\nAnd Prince Dolgoriikov rapidly but indis- \ntinctly explained Weyrother's plan of a flank- \ning movement. \n\nPrince Andrew began to reply and to state \nhis own plan, which might have been as good \nas Weyrother's, but for the disadvantage that \nWeyrother's had already been approved. As \nsoon as Prince Andrew began to demonstrate \nthe defects of the latter and the merits of his \nown plan, Prince Dolgoriikov ceased to listen \nto him and gazed absent-mindedly not at the \nmap, but at Prince Andrew's face. \n\n"There will be a council of war at Kutiizov's \ntonight, though; you can say all this there," re- \nmarked Dolgorukov. \n\n"I will do so," said Prince Andrew, moving \naway from the map. \n\n"Whatever are you bothering about, gentle- \nmen?" said Bilibin, who, till then, had listened \nwith an amused smile to their conversation \nand now was evidently ready with a joke. \n\n\n\n"Whether tomorrow brings victory or defeat, \nthe glory of our Russian arms is secure. Except \nyour Kutiizov, there is not a single Russian in \ncommand of a column! The commanders are: \nHerr General Wimpfen, le Comte de Langer- \non, le Prince de Lichtenstein, le Prince de Ho- \nhenlohe, and finally Prishprish, 1 and so on like \nall those Polish names." \n\n"Be quiet, backbiter!" said Dolgoriikov. "It \nis not true; there are now two Russians, Milo- \nrddovich, and Dokhtiirov, and there would be \na third, Count Arakchev, if his nerves were \nnot too weak." \n\n"However, I think General Kutiizov has \ncome out," said Prince Andrew. "I wish you \ngood luck and success, gentlemen!" he added \nand went out after shaking hands with Dol- \ngorukov and Bilibin. \n\nOn the way home, Prince Andrew could not \nrefrain from asking Kutiizov, who was sitting \nsilently beside him, what he thought of tomor- \nrow's battle. \n\nKutiizov looked sternly at his adjutant and, \nafter a pause, replied: "I think the battle will \nbe lost, and so I told Count Tolst6y and asked \nhim to tell the Emperor. What do you think \nhe replied? 'But, my dear general, I am en- \ngaged with rice and cutlets, look after military \nmatters yourself!' Yes . . . That was the answer \nI got!" \n\nCHAPTER XII \n\nSHORTLY AFTER nine o'clock that evening, Wey- \nrother drove with his plans to Kutiizov's quar- \nters where the council of war was to be held. \nAll the commanders of columns were sum- \nmoned to the commander in chief's and with \nthe exception of Prince Bagrati6n, who de- \nclined to come, were all there at the appointed \ntime. \n\nWeyrother, who was in full control of the \nproposed battle, by his eagerness and briskness \npresented a marked contrast to the dissatisfied \nand drowsy Kutiizov, who reluctantly played \nthe part of chairman and president of the \ncouncil of war. Weyrother evidently felt him- \nself to be at the head of a movement that had \nalready become unrestrainable. He was like a \nhorse running downhill harnessed to a heavy \ncart. Whether he was pulling it or beingpushed \nby it he did not know, but rushed along at \nheadlong speed with no time to consider what \nthis movement might lead to. Weyrother had \nbeen twice that evening to the enemy's picket \nline to reconnoiter personally, and twice to the \n\n1 General Przebysz^wski. TR. \n\n\n\nBOOK THREE \n\n\n\nEmperors, Russian and Austrian, to report \nand explain, and to his headquarters where he \nhad dictated the dispositions in German, and \nnow, much exhausted, he arrived at Kutiizov's. \n\nHe was evidently so busy that he even for- \ngot to be polite to the commander in chief. He \ninterrupted him, talked rapidly and indistinct- \nly, without looking at the man he was address- \ning, and did not reply to questions put to him. \nHe was bespattered with mud and had a piti- \nful, weary, and distracted air, though at the \nsame time he was haughty and self-confident. \n\nKutiizov was occupying a nobleman's castle \nof modest dimensions near Ostralitz. In the \nlarge drawing room which had become the \ncommander in chief's office were gathered Ku- \ntiizov himself, Weyrother, and the members of \nthe council of war. They were drinking tea, \nand only awaited Prince Bagrati6n to begin \nthe council. At last Bagrati6n's orderly came \nwith the news that the prince could not at- \ntend. Prince Andrew came in to inform the \ncommander in chief of this and, availing him- \nself of permission previously given him by Ku- \ntiizov to be present at the council, he remained \nin the room. \n\n"Since Prince Bagration is not coming, we \nmay begin," said Weyrother, hurriedly rising \nfrom his seat and going up to the table on \nwhich an enormous map of the environs of \nBriinn was spread out. \n\nKutiizov, with his uniform unbuttoned so \nthat his fat neck bulged over his collar as if es- \ncaping, was sitting almost asleep in a low chair, \nwith his podgy old hands resting symmetri- \ncally on its arms. At the sound of Weyrother's \nvoice, he opened his one eye with an effort. \n\n"Yes, yes, if you please 1 It is already late," \nsaid he, and nodding his head he let it droop \nand again closed his eye. \n\nIf at first the members of the council thought \nthat Kutiizov was pretending to sleep, the \nsounds his nose emitted during the reading \nthat followed proved that the commander in \nchief at that moment was absorbed by a far \nmore serious matter than a desire to show his \ncontempt for the dispositions or anything else \nhe was engaged in satisfying the irresistible \nhuman need for sleep. He really was asleep. \nWeyrother, with the gesture of a man too busy \nto lose a moment, glanced at Kutiizov and, \nhaving convinced himself that he was asleep, \ntook up a paper and in a loud, monotonous \nvoice began to read out the dispositions for \nthe impending battle, under a heading which \nhe also read out: \n\n\n\n"Dispositions for an attack on the enemy \nposition behind Kobelnitz and Sokolnitz, No- \nvember 30, 1805." \n\nThe dispositions were very complicated and \ndifficult. They began as follows: \n\n"As the enemy's left wing rests on wooded \nhills and his right extends along Kobelnitz \nand Sokolnitz behind the pondsuhat are there, \nwhile we, on the other hand, with our left wing \nby far outflank his right, it is advantageous to \nattack the enemy's latter wing especially if we \noccupy the villages of Sokolnitz and Kobelnitz, \nwhereby we can both fall on his flank and pur- \nsue him over the plain between Schlappanitz \nand the Thuerassa forest, avoiding the defiles \nof Schlappanitz and Bellowitz which cover the \nenemy's front. For this object it is necessary \nthat . . . The first column inarches . . . The \nsecond column marches . . . The third column \nmarches . . ." and so on, read Weyrother. \n\nThe generals seemed to listen reluctantly to \nthe difficult dispositions. The tall, fair-haired \nGeneral Buxhowden stood, leaning his back \nagainst the wall, his eyes fixed on a burning \ncandle, and seemed not to listen or even to \nwish to be thought to listen. Exactly opposite \nWeyrother, with his glistening wide-open eyes \nfixed upon him and his mustache twisted up- \nwards, sat the ruddy Milorddovich in a mili- \ntary pose, his elbows turned outwards, his \nhands on his knees, and his shoulders raised. \nHe remained stubbornly silent, gazing at Wey- \nrother's face, and only turned away his eyes \nwhen the Austrian chief of staff finished read- \ning. Then Milorddovich looked round signifi- \ncantly at the other generals. But one could not \ntell from that significant look whether he \nagreed or disagreed and was satisfied or not with \nthe arrangements. Next to Weyrother sat Count \nLangeron who, with a subtle smile that never \nleft his typically southern French face during \nthe whole time of the reading, gazed at his deli- \ncate fingers which rapidly twirled by its cor- \nners a gold snuffbox on which was a portrait. \nIn the middle of one of the longest sentences, \nhe stopped the rotary motion of the snuffbox, \nraised his head, and with inimical politeness \nlurking in the corners of his thin lips inter- \nrupted Weyrother, wishing to say something. \nBut the Austrian general, continuing to read, \nfrowned angrily and jerked his elbows, as if to \nsay: "You can tell me your views later, but now \nbe so good as to look at the map and listen." \nLangeron lifted his eyes with an expression of \nperplexity, turned round to Milorddovich as \nif seeking an explanation, but meeting the lat- \n\n\n\n146 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nter's impressive but meaningless gaze drooped \nhis eyes sadly and again took to twirling his \nsnuffbox. \n\n"A geography lesson I " he muttered as if to \nhimself, but loud enough to be heard. \n\nPrzebysz^wski, with respectful but dignified \npoliteness, held his hand to his ear toward \nWeyrother, with the air of a man absorbed in \nattention. Dohktiirov, a little man, sat opposite \nWeyrother, with an assiduous and modest \nmien, and stooping over the outspread map \nconscientiously studied the dispositions and \nthe unfamiliar locality. He asked Weyrother \nseveral times to repeat words he had not clear- \nly heard and the difficult names of villages. \nWeyrother complied and Dohkturov noted \nthem down. \n\nWhen the reading which lasted more than \nan hour was over, Langeron again brought his \nsnuffbox to rest and, without looking at Wey- \nrother or at anyone in particular, began to say \nhow difficult it was to carry out such a plan in \nwhich the enemy's position was assumed to be \nknown, whereas it was perhaps not known, \nsince the enemy was in movement. Langeron 's \nobjections were valid but it was obvious that \ntheir chief aim was to show General Weyroth- \ner who had read his dispositions with as much \nself-confidence as if he were addressing school \nchildren that he had to do, not with fools, but \nwitlrmen who could teach him something in \nmilitary matters. \n\nWhen the monotonous sound of Weyroth- \ner's voice ceased, Kutuzov opened his eye as a \nmiller wakes up when the soporific drone of \nthe mill wheel is interrupted. He listened to \nwhat Langeron said, as if remarking, "So you \nare still at that silly business!" quickly closed \nhis eye again, and let his head sink still lower. \n\nLangeron, trying as virulently as possible to \nsting Weyrother's vanity as author of the mili- \ntary plan, argued that Bonaparte might easily \nattack instead of being attacked, and so render \nthe whole of this plan perfectly worthless. \nWeyrother met all objections with a firm and \ncontemptuous smile, evidently prepared be- \nforehand to meet all objections be they what \nthey might. \n\n"If he could attack us, he would have done \nso today," said he. \n\n"So you think he is powerless?" said Langer- \non. \n\n"He has forty thousand men at most," re- \nplied Weyrother, with the smile of a doctor to \nwhom an old wife wishes to explain the treat- \nment of a case. \n\n\n\n"In that case he is inviting his doom by \nawaiting our attack," said Langeron, with a \nsubtly ironical smile, again glancing round for \nsupport to Milorddovich who was near him. \n\nBut Milorddovich was at that moment evi- \ndently thinking of anything rather than of \nwhat the generals were disputing about. \n\n"Ma foil" said he, "tomorrow we shall see \nall that on the battlefield." \n\nWeyrother again gave that smile which \nseemed to say that to him it was strange and \nridiculous to meet objections from Russian \ngenerals and to have to prove to them what he \nhad not merely convinced himself of, but had \nalso convinced the sovereign Emperors of. \n\n"The enemy has quenched his fires and a \ncontinual noise is heard from his camp," said \nhe. "What does that mean? Either he is retreat- \ning, which is the only thing we need fear, or \nhe is changing his position." (He smiled iron- \nically.) "But even if he also took up a position \nin the Thuerassa, he merely saves us a great \ndeal of trouble and all our arrangements to \nthe minutest detail remain the same." \n\n"How is that? . . ." began Prince Andrew, \nwho had for long been waiting an opportunity \nto express his doubts. \n\nKutuzov here woke up, coughed heavily, and \nlooked round at the generals. \n\n"Gentlemen, the dispositions for tomorrow \nor rather for today, for it is past midnight \ncannot now be altered," said he. "You have \nheard them, and we shall all do our duty. But \nbefore a battle, there is nothing more impor- \ntant . . ." he paused, "than to have a good \nsleep." \n\nHe moved as if to rise. The generals bowed \nand retired. It was past midnight. Prince An- \ndrew went out. \n\nThe council of war, at which Prince Andrew \nhad not been able to express his opinion as he \nhad hoped to, left on him a vague and uneasy \nimpression. Whether Dolgoriikov and Wey- \nrother, or Kutuzov, Langeron, and the others \nwho did not approve of the plan of attack, \nwere right he did not know. "But was it really \nnot possible for Kutiizov to state his views \nplainly to the Emperor? Is it possible that on \naccount of court and personal considerations \ntens of thousands of lives, and my life, my life," \nhe thought, "must be risked?" \n\n"Yes, it is very likely that I shall be killed \ntomorrow," he thought. And suddenly, at this \nthought of death, a whole series of most dis- \ntant, most intimate, memories rose in his im- \n\n\n\nBOOK \n\nagination: he remembered his last parting from \nhis father and his wife; he remembered the \ndays when he first loved her. He thought of \nher pregnancy and felt sorry for her and for \nhimself, and in a nervously emotional and sof- \ntened mood he went out of the hut in which \nhe was billeted with Nesvitski and began to \nwalk up and down before it. \n\nThe night was foggy and through the fog the \nmoonlight gleamed mysteriously. "Yes, tomor- \nrow, tomorrow!" he thought. "Tomorrow ev- \nerything may be over for me! All these mem- \nories will be no more, none of them will have \nany meaning for me. Tomorrow perhaps, even \ncertainly, I have a presentiment that for the \nfirst time I shall have to show all I can do." \nAnd his fancy pictured the battle, its loss, the \nconcentration of fighting at one point, and the \nhesitation of all the commanders. And then \nthat happy moment, that Toulon for which he \nhad so long waited, presents itself to him at \nlast. He firmly and clearly expresses his opin- \nion to Kutuzov, to Weyrother, and to the Em- \nperors. All are struck by the justness of his \nviews, but no one undertakes to carry them \nout, so he takes a regiment, a divisionstipu- \nlates that no one is to interfere with his ar- \nrangementsleads his division to the decisive \npoint, and gains the victory alone. "But death \nand suffering?" suggested another voice. Prince \nAndrew, however, did not answer that voice \nand went on dreaming of his triumphs. The \ndispositions for the next battle are planned by \nhim alone. Nominally he is only an adjutant \non Kutiizov's staff, but he does everything \nalone. The next battle is won by him alone. \nKutuzov is removed and he is appointed . . . \n"Well and then?" asked the other voice. "If \nbefore that you are not ten times wounded, \nkilled, or betrayed, well . . . what then? . . ." \n"Well then," Prince Andrew answered himself, \n"I don't know what will happen and don't \nwant to know, and can't, but if I want this \nwant glory, want to be known to men, want to \nbe loved by them, it is not my fault that I want \nit and want nothing but that and live only for \nthat. Yes, for that alone! I shall never tell any- \none, but, oh God! what am I to do if I love \nnothing but fame and men's esteem? Death, \nwounds, the loss of family I fear nothing. And \nprecious and dear as many persons are to me \nfather, sister, wife those dearest to me yet \ndreadful and unnatural as it seems, I would give \nthem all at once for a moment of glory, of tri- \numph over men, of love from men I don't \nknow and never shall know, for the love of \n\n\n\nTHREE 147 \n\nthese men here," he thought, as he listened to \nvoices in Kuttizov's courtyard. The voices were \nthose of the orderlies who were packing up; \none voice, probably a coachman's, was teasing \nKutiizov's old cook whom Prince Andrew knew, \nand who was called Tit. He was saying, "Tit, \nI say, Tit!" \n\n"Well?" returned the old man. \n\n"Go, Tit, thresh a bit!" said the wag. \n\n"Oh, go to the devil!" called out a voice, \ndrowned by the laughter of the orderlies and \nservants. \n\n"All the same, I love and value nothing but \ntriumph over them all, I value this mystic pow- \ner and glory that is floating here above me in \nthis mist!" \n\nCHAPTER XIII \n\nTHAT SAME NIGHT, Rost6v was with a platoon \non skirmishing duty in front of Bagrati6n's \ndetachment. His hussars were placed along the \nline in couples and he himself rode along the \nline trying to master the sleepiness that kept \ncoming over him. An enormous space, with \nour army's campfires dimly glowing in the fog, \ncould be seen behind him; in front of him was \nmisty darkness. Rostov could see nothing, peer \nas he would into that foggy distance: now some- \nthing gleamed gray, now there was something \nblack, now little lights seemed to glimmer \nwhere the enemy ought to be, now he fancied \nit was only something in his own eyes. His eyes \nkept closing, and in his fancy appeared now \nthe Emperor, now Denfsov, and now Moscow \nmemories and he again hurriedly opened his \neyes and saw close before him the head and \nears of the horse he was riding, and sometimes, \nwhen he came within six paces of them, the \nblack figures of hussars, but in the distance \nwas still the same misty darkness. "Why not? \n... It might easily happen," thought Rost6v, \n"that the Emperor will meet me and give me \nan order as he would to any other officer; he'll \nsay: 'Go and find out what's there.' There are \nmany stories of his getting to know an officer in \njust such a chance way and attaching him to \nhimself! What if he gave me a place near him? \nOh, how I would guard him, how I would tell \nhim the truth, how I would unmask his deceiv- \ners!" And in order to realize vividly his love and \ndevotion to the sovereign, Rost6v pictured to \nhimself an enemy or a deceitful German, whom \nhe would not only kill with pleasure but whom \nhe would slap in the face before the Emperor. \nSuddenly a distant shout aroused him. He \nstarted and opened his eyes. \n\n\n\n148 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\n"Where am I? Oh yes, in the skirmishing line \n. . . pass and watchword sh aft, Olmutz. What a \nnuisance that our squadron will be in reserve \ntomorrow/' he thought. "I'll ask leave to go to \nthe front, this may be my only chance of see- \ning the Emperor. It won't be long now before \nI am off duty. I'll take another turn and when \nI get back I'll go to the general and ask him." \nHe readjusted himself in the saddle and touched \nup his horse to ride once more round his hus- \nsars. It seemed to him that it was getting light- \ner. To the left he saw a sloping descent lit up, \nand facing it a black knoll that seemed as steep \nas a wall. On this knoll there was a white patch \nthat Rost6v could not at all make out: was it a \nglade in the wood lit up by the moon, or some \nunmelted snow, or some white houses? He even \nthought something moved on that white spot. \n"I expect it's snow . . . that spot ... a spot une \ntache/' he thought. "There now . . . it's not a \ntache . . . Natasha . . . sister, black eyes . . . Na \n. . . tasha . . . (Won't she be surprised when I \ntell her how I've seen the Emperor?) Natcisha \n. . . take mysabretache . . .""Keep to theright, \nyour honor, there are bushes here," came the \nvoice of an hussar, past whom Rost6v was rid- \ning in the act of falling asleep. Rost6v lifted his \nhead that had sunk almost to his horse's mane \nand pulled up beside the hussar. He was suc- \ncumbing to irresistible, youthful, childish drow- \nsiness. "But what was I thinking? I mustn't for- \nget. How shall I speak to the Emperor? No, \nthat's not it that's tomorrow. Oh yes! Natdsha \n. . . sabretache . . . saber them . . . Whom? The \nhussars . . . Ah, the hussars with mustaches. \nAlong the Tverskiya Street rode the hussar \nwith mustaches ... I thought about him too, \njust opposite Guryev's house . . . Old Guryev \n. . . Oh, but Denfsov's a fine fellow. But that's \nall nonsense. The chief thing is that the Em- \nperor is here. How he looked at me and wished \n\nto say something, but dared not No, it was \n\nI who dared not. But that's nonsense, the chief \nthing is not to forget the important thing I was \nthinking of. Yes, Na-tdsha, sabretache, oh, yes, \nyes! That's right!" And his head once more \nsank to his horse's neck. All at once it seemed \nto him that he was being fired at. "What? \nWhat? What? . . . Cut them down! What? . . ." \nsaid Rost6v, waking up. At the moment he \nopened his eyes he heard in front of him, where \nthe enemy was, the long-drawn shouts of thou- \nsands of voices. His horse and the horse of the \nhussar near him pricked their ears at these \nshouts. Over there, where the shouting came \nfrom, a fire flared up and went out again, then \n\n\n\nanother, and all along the French line on the \nhill fires flared up and the shouting grew loud- \ner and louder. Rost6v could hear the sound of \nFrench words but could not distinguish them. \nThe din of many voices was too great; all he \ncould hear was: "ahahah!" and "rrrr!" \n\n"What's that? What do you make of it?" said \nRost6v to the hussar beside him. "That must \nbe the enemy's camp!" \n\nThe hussar did not reply. \n\n"Why, don't you hear it?" Rost6v asked \nagain, after waiting for a reply. \n\n"Who can tell, your honor?" replied the hus- \nsar reluctantly. \n\n"From the direction, it must be the enemy," \nrepeated Rost6v. \n\n"It may be he or it may be nothing," muttered \nthe hussar. "It's dark . . . Steady!" he cried to \nhis fidgeting horse. \n\nRost6v's horse was also getting restive: it \npawed the frozen ground, pricking its ears at \nthe noise and looking at the lights. The shout- \ning grew still louder and merged into a general \nroar that only an army of several thousand \nmen could produce. The lights spread farther \nand farther, probably along the line of the \nFrench camp. Rost6v no longer wanted to \nsleep. The gay triumphant shouting of the \nenemy army had a stimulating effect on him. \n"Vive I'Empereur! VEmpereur!" he now \nheard distinctly. \n\n"They can't be far off, probably just beyond \nthe stream," he said to the hussar beside him. \n\nThe hussar only sighed without replying and \ncoughed angrily. The sound of horse's hoofs \napproaching at a trot along the line of hussars \nwas heard, and out of the foggy darkness the \nfigure of a sergeant of hussars suddenly ap- \npeared, looming huge as an elephant. \n\n"Your honor, the generals I "said the sergeant, \nriding up to Rost6v. \n\nRostov, still looking round toward the fires \nand the shouts, rode with the sergeant to meet \nsome mounted men who were riding along the \nline. One was on a white horse. Prince Bagra- \nti6n and Prince Dolgorukov with their adju- \ntants had come to witness the curious phenom- \nenon of the lights and shouts in the enemy's \ncamp. Rost6v rode up to Bagrati6n, reported \nto him, and then joined the adjutants listen- \ning to what the generals were saying. \n\n"Believe me," said Prince Dolgorukov, ad- \ndressing Bagrati6n, "it is nothing but a trick! \nHe has retreated and ordered the rearguard to \nkindle fires and make a noise to deceive us." \n\n"Hardly," said Bagrati6n. "I saw them this \n\n\n\nBOOK THREE \n\n\n\n149 \n\n\n\nevening on that knoll; if they had retreated \nthey would have withdrawn from that too. . . . \nOfficer!" said Bagratidn to Rost6v, "are the en- \nemy's skirmishers still there?" \n\n"They were there this evening, but now I \ndon't know, your excellency. Shall I go with \nsome of my hussars to see?" replied Rost6v. \n\nBagrati6n stopped and, before replying, \ntried to see Rost6v's face in the mist. \n\n"Well, go and see," he said, after a pause. \n\n"Yes, sir." \n\nRost6v spurred his horse, called to Sergeant \nFddchenko and two other hussars, told them to \nfollow him, and trotted downhill in the direc- \ntion from which the shouting came. He felt \nboth frightened and pleased to be riding alone \nwith three hussars into that mysterious and \ndangerous misty distance where no one had \nbeen before him. Bagrati6n called to him from \nthe hill not to go beyond the stream, but Ros- \ntdv pretended not to hear him and did not \nstop but rodeon and on, continually mistaking \nbushes for trees and gullies for men and con- \ntinually discovering his mistakes. Having de- \nscended the hill at a trot, he no longer saw ei- \nther our own or the enemy's fires, but heard \nthe shouting of the French more loudly and \ndistinctly. In the valley he saw before him \nsomething like a river, but when he reached it \nhe found it was a road. Having come out onto \nthe road he reined in his horse, hesitating \nwhether to ride along it or cross it and ride \nover the black field up the hillside. To keep to \nthe road which gleamed white in the mist \nwould have been safer because it would be \neasier to see people coming along it. "Follow \nme!" said he, crossed the road, and began rid- \ning up the hill at a gallop toward the point \nwhere the French pickets had been standing \nthat evening. \n\n"Your honor, there he is!" cried one of the \nhussars behind him. And before Rost6v had \ntime to make out what the black thing was \nthat had suddenly appeared in the fog, there \nwas a flash, followed by a report, and a bullet \nwhizzing high up in the mist with a plaintive \nsound passed out of hearing. Another musket \nmissed fire but flashed in the pan. Rost6v \nturned his horse and galloped back. Four more \nreports followed at intervals, and the bullets \npassed somewhere in the fog singing in differ- \nent tones. Rost6v reined in his horse, whose \nspirits had risen, like his own, at the firing, and \nwent back at a footpace. "Well, some more! \nSome more!" a merry voice was saying in his \nsoul. But no more shots came. \n\n\n\nOnly when approaching Bagrati6n did Ros- \nt6v let his horse gallop again, and with his hand \nat the salute rode up to the general. \n\nDolgorukov was still insisting that the \nFrench had retreated and had only lit fires to \ndeceive us. \n\n"What does that prove?" he was saying as \nRost6v rode up. "They might rejreat and leave \nthe pickets." \n\n"It's plain that they have not all gone yet, \nPrince," said Bagration. "Wait till tomorrow \nmorning, we'll find out everything tomorrow." \n\n"The picket is still on the hill, your excel- \nlency, just where itwas in the even ing, "report- \ned Rostov, stooping forward with his hand at \nthe salute and unable to repress the smile of \ndelight induced by his ride and especially by \nthe sound of the bullets. \n\n"Very good, very good," said Bagrati6n. \n"Thank you, officer." \n\n"Your excellency," said Rost6v, "may I ask a \nfavor?" \n\n"What is it?" \n\n"Tomorrow our squadron is to be in reserve. \nMay I ask to beattached to the first squadron?" \n\n"What's your name?" \n\n"Count Rost6v." \n\n"Oh, very well, you may stay in attendance \non me." \n\n"Count Ily Rost6v's son?" asked Dolgoru- \nkov. \n\nBut Rost6v did not reply. \n\n"Then I may reckon on it, your excellency?" \n\n"I will give the order." \n\n"Tomorrow very likely I may be sent with \nsome message to the Emperor," thought Rost6v. \n"Thank God!" \n\nThe fires and shouting in the enemy's army \nwere occasioned by the fact that while Napole- \non's proclamation was being read to the troops \nthe Emperor himself rode round his bivouacs. \nThe soldiers, on seeing him, lit wisps of straw \nand ran after him, shouting, "Vive I'Emper- \neurl" Napoleon's proclamation was as follows: \n\nSoldiers! The Russian army is advancing against \nyou to avenge the Austrian army of Ulm. They are \nthe same battalions you broke at Hollabrunn and \nhave pursued ever since to this place. The position \nwe occupy is a strong one, and while they are \nmarching to go round me on the right they will \nexpose a flank to me. Soldiers! I will myself direct \nyour battalions. I will keep out of fire if you with \nyour habitual valor carry disorder and confusion \ninto the enemy's ranks, but should victory be in \ndoubt, even for a moment, you will see your Em- \n\n\n\n1 5 \n\nperor exposing himself to the first blows of the \nenemy, for there must be no doubt of victory, es- \npecially on this day when what is at stake is the \nhonor of the French infantry, so necessary to the \nhonor of our nation. \n\nDo not break your ranks on the plea of remov- \ning the wounded! Let every man be fully imbued \nwith the thought that we must defeat these hire- \nlings of England, inspired by such hatred of our \nnation! This victory will conclude our campaign \nand we can return to winter quarters, where fresh \nFrench troops who are being raised in France will \njoin us, and the peace I shall conclude will be \nworthy of my people, of you, and of myself. \n\nNAPOLEON \n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV \n\nAT FIVE in the morning it was still quite dark. \nThe troops of the center, the reserves, and Ba- \ngrati6n's right flank had not yet moved, but on \nthe left flank the columns of infantry, cavalry, \nand artillery, which were to be the first to de- \nscend the heights to attack the French right \nflank and drive it into the Bohemian moun- \ntains according to plan, were already up and \nastir. The smoke of the campfires, into which \nthey were throwing everything superfluous, \nmade the eyes smart. It was cold and dark. The \nofficers were hurriedly drinking tea and break- \nfasting, the soldiers, munching biscuitand beat- \ning a tattoo with their feet to warm themselves, \ngathering round the fires throwing into the \nflames the remains of sheds, chairs, tables, \nwheels, tubs, and everything that they did not \nwant or could not carry away with them. Aus- \ntrian column guides were moving in and out \namong the Russian troops and served as her- \nalds of the advance. As soon as an Austrian of- \nficer showed himself near a commanding offi- \ncer's quarters, the regiment began to move: the \nsoldiers ran from the fires, thrust their pipes in- \nto their boots, their bags into the carts, got \ntheir muskets ready, and formed rank. The of- \nficers buttoned up their coats, buckled on their \nswords and pouches, and moved along the ranks \nshouting. The train drivers and orderlies har- \nnessed and packed the wagons and tied on the \nloads. The adjutants and battalion and regi- \nmental commanders mounted, crossed them- \nselves, gave final instructions, orders, and com- \nmissions to the baggage men who remained be- \nhind, and the monotonous tramp of thousands \nof feet resounded. The column moved forward \nwithout knowing where and unable, from the \nmasses around them, the smoke and the increas- \ning fog, to see either the place they were leav- \ning or that to which they were going. \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\nA soldier on the march is hemmed in and \nborne along by his regiment as much as a \nsailor is by his ship. However far he has walked, \nwhatever strange, unknown, and dangerous \nplaces he reaches, just as a sailor is always sur- \nrounded by the same decks, masts, and rigging \nof his ship, so the soldier always has around \nhim the same comrades, the same ranks, the \nsame sergeant major Ivan Mitrich, the same \ncompany dog Jack, and the same commanders. \nThe sailor rarely cares to know the latitude in \nwhich his ship is sailing, but on the day of bat- \ntleheaven knows how and whencea stern \nnote of which all are conscious sounds in the \nmoral atmosphere of an army, announcing the \napproach of something decisive and solemn, \nand awakening in the men an unusual curios- \nity. On the day of battle the soldiers excitedly \ntry to get beyond the interests of their regiment, \nthey listen intently, look about, and eagerly \nask concerning what is going on around them. \n\nThe fog had grown so dense that though it \nwas growing light they could not see ten paces \nahead. Bushes looked like gigantic trees and \nlevel ground like cliffs and slopes. Anywhere, \non any side, one might encounter an enemy in- \nvisible ten paces off. But the columns advanced \nfor a long time, always in thesame fog, descend- \ning and ascending hills, avoiding gardens and \nenclosures, going over new and unknown \nground, and nowhere encountering the enemy. \nOn the contrary, the soldiers became aware \nthat in front, behind, and on all sides, other \nRussian columns were moving in the same di- \nrection. Every soldier felt glad to know that to \nthe unknown place where he was going, many \nmore of our men were going too. \n\n"There now, the Kiirskies have also gone \npast," was being said in the ranks. \n\n"It's wonderful what a lot of our troops have \ngathered, lads 1 Last night I looked at thecamp- \nfires and there was no end of them. A regular \nMoscow 1" \n\nThough none of the column commanders \nrode up to the ranks or talked to the men (the \ncommanders, as we saw at the council of war, \nwere out of humor and dissatisfied with the af- \nfair, and so did not exert themselves to cheer \nthe men but merely carried out the orders), yet \nthe troops marched gaily, as they always do \nwhen going into action, especially to an attack. \nBut when they had marched for about an hour \nin the dense fog, the greater part of the men \nhad to halt and an unpleasant consciousness of \nsome dislocation and blunder spread through \nthe ranks. How such a consciousness is com- \n\n\n\nBOOK THREE \n\n\n\nmunicated is very difficult to define, but it cer- \ntainly is communicated very surely, and flows \nrapidly, imperceptibly, and irrepressibly, as \nwater does in a creek. Had the Russian army \nbeen alone without any allies, it might perhaps \nhave been a long time before this consciousness \nof mismanagement became a general convic- \ntion, but as it was, the disorder was readily \nandnaturally attributed to thestupid Germans, \nand everyone was convinced that a dangerous \nmuddle had been occasioned by the sausage \neaters. \n\n"Why have we stopped? Is the way blocked? \nOr have we already come up against the \nFrench?" \n\n"No, one can't hear them. They'd be firing \nif we had." \n\n"They were in a hurry enough to start us, \nand now here we stand in the middle of a field \nwithout rhyme or reason. It's all those damned \nGermans' muddling! What stupid devils!" \n\n"Yes, I'd send them on in front, but no fear, \nthey're crowding up behind. And now here we \nstand hungry." \n\n"I say, shall we soon be clear? They say the \ncavalry are blocking the way," said an officer. \n\n"Ah, those damned Germans! They don't \nknow their own country!" said another. \n\n"What division are you?" shouted an adju- \ntant, riding up. \n\n"The Eighteenth." \n\n"Then why are you here? You should have \ngone on long ago, now you won't get there till \nevening." \n\n"What stupid orders! They don't themselves \nknow what they are doing!" said the officer and \nrode off. \n\nThen a general rode past shouting something \nangrily, not in Russian. \n\n"Tafa-lafa! But what he's jabbering no one \ncan make out," said a soldier, mimicking the \ngeneral who had ridden away. "I'd shoot them, \nthe scoundrels!" \n\n"We were ordered to be at the place before \nnine, but we haven't got halfway. Fine orders!" \nwas being repeated on different sides. \n\nAnd the feeling of energy with which the \ntroops had started began to turn into vexation \nand anger at the stupid arrangements and at \nthe Germans. \n\nThe cause of the confusion was that while \nthe Austrian cavalry was moving toward our \nleft flank, the higher command found that our \ncenter was too far separated from our right \nflank and the cavalry were all ordered to turn \nback to the right. Several thousand cavalry \n\n\n\ncrossed in front of the infantry, who had to \nwait. \n\nAt the front an altercation occurred between \nan Austrian guide and a Russian general. The \ngeneral shouted a demand that the cavalry \nshould be halted, the Austrian argued that not \nhe, but the higher command, was to blame. \nThe troops meanwhile stood growing listless \nand dispirited. After an hour's delay they at \nlast moved on, descending the hill. The fog \nthat was dispersing on the hill lay still more \ndensely below, where they were descending. In \nfront in the fog a shot was heard and then an- \nother, at first irregularly at varying intervals \ntrata . . . tat and then more and more regular- \nly and rapidly, and the action at the Goldbach \nStream began. \n\nNot expecting to come on the enemy down \nby the stream, and having stumbled on him in \nthe fog, hearing no encouraging word from \ntheir commanders, and with a consciousness of \nbeing too late spreading through the ranks, \nand above all being unable to see anything in \nfront or around them in the thick fog, the \nRussians exchanged shots with the enemy la- \nzily and advanced and again halted, receiving \nno timely orders from ttye officers or adjutants \nwho wandered about in the fog in those un- \nknown surroundings unable to find their own \nregiments. In this way the action began for \nthe first, second, and third columns, which had \ngone down into the valley. The fourth col- \numn, with which Kutiizov was, stood on the \nPratzen Heights. \n\nBelow, where the fight was beginning, there \nwas still thick fog; on the higher ground it was \nclearing, but nothing could be seen of what \nwas going on in front. Whether all the enemy \nforces were, as we supposed, six miles away, or \nwhether they were near by in that sea of mist, \nno one knew till after eight o'clock. \n\nIt was nine o'clock in the morning. The fog \nlay unbroken like a sea down below, but high- \ner up at the village of Schlappanitz where Na- \npoleon stood with his marshals around him, it \nwas quite light. Above him was a clear blue sky, \nand the sun's vast orb quivered like a huge hol- \nlow, crimson float on the surface of that milky \nsea of mist. The whole French army, and even \nNapoleon himself with his staff, were not on \nthe far side of the streams and hollows of Sok- \nolnitz and Schlappanitz beyond which we in- \ntended to take up our position and begin the \naction, but were on this side, so close to our \nown forces that Napoleon with the naked eye \ncould distinguish a mounted man from one on \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nfoot. Napoleon, in the blue cloak which he had \nworn on his Italian campaign, sat on his small \ngray Arab horse a little in front of his marshals. \nHe gazed silently at the hills which seemed to \nrise out of the sea of mist and on which the \nRussian troops were moving in the distance, \nand he listened to the sounds of firing in the \nvalley. Not a single muscle of his face which \nin those days was still thin moved. His gleam- \ning eyes were fixed intently on one spot. His \npredictions were being justified. Part of the \nRussian force had already descended into the \nvalley toward the ponds and lakes and part \nwere leaving these Pratzen Heights which he \nintended to attack and regarded as the key to \nthe position. He saw over the mist that in a hol- \nlow between two hills near the village of Prat- \nzen, the Russian columns, their bayonets glit- \ntering, were moving continuously in one direc- \ntion toward the valley and disappearing one \nafter another into the mist. From information \nhe had received the evening before, from the \nsound of wheels and footsteps heard by the out- \nposts during the night, by the disorderly move- \nment of the Russian columns, and from all in- \ndications, he saw clearly that the allies believed \nhim to be far away in front of them, and that \nthe columns moving near Pratzen constituted \nthe center of the Russian army, and that that \ncenter was already sufficiently weakened to be \nsuccessfully attacked. But still he did not begin \nthe engagement. \n\nToday was a great day for him the anniver- \nsary of his coronation. Before dawn he had \nslept for a few hours, and refreshed, vigorous, \nand in good spirits, he mounted his horse and \nrode out into the field in that happy mood in \nwhich every thing seems possible and everything \nsucceeds. He sat motionless, looking at the \nheights visible above the mist, and his cold face \nwore that special look of confident, self-com- \nplacent happiness that one sees on the face of \na boy happily in love. The marshals stood be- \nfeind him not venturing to distract his atten- \ntion. He looked now at the Pratzen Heights, \nnow at the sun floating up out of the mist. \n\nWhen the sun had entirely emerged from \nthe fog, and fields and mist were aglow with \ndazzling light as if he had only awaited this to \nbegin the action he drew the glove from his \nshapely white hand, made a sign with it to the \nmarshals, and ordered the action to begin. The \nmarshals, accompanied by adjutants, galloped \noff in different directions, and a few minutes \nlater the chief forces of the French army moved \nrapidly toward those Pratzen Heights which \n\n\n\nwere being more and more denuded by Rus- \nsian troops moving down the valley to their \nleft \n\nCHAPTER XV \n\nAT EIGHT O'CLOCK Kuttizov rode to Pratzen at \nthe head of the fourth column, Milorddovich's, \nthe one that was to take the place of Przeby- \nszlwski's and Langeron's columns which had \nalready gone down into the valley. He greeted \nthe men of the foremost regiment and gave \nthem the order to march, thereby indicating \nthat he intended to lead that column himself. \nWhen he had reached the village of Pratzen he \nhalted. Prince Andrew was behind, among the \nimmense number forming the commander in \nchiefs suite. He was in a state of suppressed ex- \ncitement and irritation, though controlledly \ncalm as a man is at the approach of a long- \nawaited moment. He was firmly convinced that \nthis was the day of his Toulon, or his bridge of \nArcola. 1 How it would come about he did not \nknow, but he felt sure it would do so. The lo- \ncality and the position of our troops were \nknown to him as far as they could be known to \nanyone in our army. His own strategic plan, \nwhich obviously could not now be carried out, \nwas forgotten. Now, entering into Weyrother's \nplan, Prince Andrew considered possible con- \ntingencies and formed new projects such as \nmight call for his rapidity of perception and \ndecision. \n\nTo the left down below in the mist, the mus- \nketry fire of unseen forces could be heard. It \nwas there Prince Andrew thought the fight \nwould concentrate. "There we shall encounter \ndifficulties, and there," thought he, "I shall be \nsent with a brigade or division, and there, stand- \nard in hand, I shall go forward and break what- \never is in front of me." \n\nHe could not look calmly at the standards of \nthe passing battalions. Seeing them he kept \nthinking, "That may be the very standard with \nwhich I shall lead the army." \n\nIn the morning all that was left of the night \nmist on the heights was a hoar frost now turn- \ning to dew, but in the valleys it still lay like a \nmilk-white sea. Nothing was visible in the val- \nley to the left into which our troops had de- \nscended and from whence came the sounds of \nfiring. Above the heights was the dark clear sky, \nand to the right the vast orb of the sun. In \nfront, far off on the farther shore of that sea of \n\nx The scene of Napoleon's brilliant victory in \nthe province of Verona over greatly superior Aus- \ntrian forces, in 1796. TR. \n\n\n\nBOOK THREE \n\n\n\n153 \n\n\n\nmist, some wooded hills were discernible, and \nit was there the enemy probably was, for some- \nthing could be descried. On the right the \nGuards were entering the misty region with a \nsound of hoofs and wheels and now and then \na gleam of bayonets; to the left beyond the vil- \nlage similar masses of cavalry came up and dis- \nappeared in the sea of mist. In front and behind \nmoved infantry. The commander in chief was \nstanding at the end of the village letting the \ntroops pass by him. That morning Kutuzov \nseemed worn and irritable. The infantry pass- \ning before him came to a halt without any \ncommand being given, apparently obstructed \nby something in front. \n\n"Do order them to form into battalion col- \numns and go round the villagel" he said angri- \nly to a general who had ridden up. "Don't you \nunderstand, your excellency, my dear sir, that \nyou must not defile through narrow village \nstreets when we are marching against the ene- \nmy?" \n\n"I intended to re-form them beyond the vil- \nlage, your excellency," answered the general. \n\nKutuzov laughed bitterly. \n\n"You'll make a fine thing of it, deploying in \nsight of the enemy! Very fine!" \n\n"The enemy is still far away, your excellency. \nAccording to the dispositions . . ." \n\n"The dispositions!" exclaimed Kutuzov bit- \nterly. "Who told you that? . . . Kindly do as you \nare ordered." \n\n"Yes, sir." \n\n"My dear fellow," Nesvftski whispered to \nPrince Andrew, "the old man is as surly as a \ndog." \n\nAn Austrian officer in a white uniform with \ngreen plumes in his hat galloped up to Kutu- \nzov and asked in the Emperor's name had the \nfourth column advanced into action. \n\nKutuzov turned round without answering \nand his eye happened to fall upon Prince An- \ndrew, who was beside him. Seeing him, Kutu- \nzov's malevolent and caustic expression sof- \ntened, as if admitting that what was being done \nwas not his adjutant's fault, and still not an- \nswering the Austrian adjutant, he addressed \nBolk6nski. \n\n"Go, my dear fellow, and see whether the \nthird division has passed the village. Tell it to \nstop and await my orders." \n\nHardly had Prince Andrew started than he \nstopped him. \n\n"And ask whether sharpshooters have been \nposted," he added. "What are they doing? \nWhat are they doing?" he murmured to him- \n\n\n\nself, still not replying to the Austrian. \n\nPrince Andrew galloped off to execute the \norder. \n\nOvertaking the battalions that continued to \nadvance, he stopped the third division and con- \nvinced himself that there really were no sharp- \nshooters in front of our columns. The colonel \nat the head of the regiment was much surprised \nat the commander in chief's order to throw out \nskirmishers. He had felt perfectly sure that \nthere were other troops in front of him and \nthat the enemy must be at least six miles away. \nThere was really nothing to be seen in front \nexcept a barren descent hidden by dense mist. \nHaving given orders in the commander in \nchief's name to rectify this omission, Prince \nAndrew galloped back. Kutuzov still in the \nsame place, his stout body resting heavily in \nthe saddle with the lassitude of age, sat yawn- \ning wearily with closed eyes. The troops were \nno longer moving, but stood with the butts of \ntheir muskets on the ground. \n\n"All right, all right!" he said to Prince An- \ndrew, and turned to a general who, watch in \nhand, was saying it was time they started as all \nthe left-flank columns had already descended. \n\n"Plenty of time, your excellency," muttered \nKutuzov in the midst of a yawn. "Plenty of \ntime," he repeated. \n\nJust then at a distance behind Kutuzov was \nheard the sound of regiments saluting, and \nthis sound rap idly came nearer along the whole \nextended line of the advancing Russian col- \numns. Evidently the person they were greeting \nwas riding quickly. When the soldiers of the \nregiment in front of which Kutuzov was stand- \ning began to shout, he rode a little to one side \nand looked round with a frown. Along the road \nfrom Pratzen galloped what looked like a \nsquadron of horsemen in various uniforms. \nTwo of them rode side by side in front, at full \ngallop. One in a black uniform with white \nplumes in his hat rode a bobtailed chestnut \nhorse, the other who was in a white uniform \nrode a black one. These were the two Emper- \nors followed by their suites. Kutuzov, affecting \nthe manners of an old soldier at the front, \ngave the command "Attention!" and rode up \nto the Emperors with a salute. His whole ap- \npearance and manner were suddenly trans- \nformed. He put on the air of a subordinate \nwho obeys without reasoning. With an affecta- \ntion of respect which evidently struck Alex- \nander unpleasantly, he rode up and saluted. \n\nThis unpleasant impression merely flitted \nover the young and happy face of the Emperor \n\n\n\n154 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nlike a cloud of haze across a clear sky and van- \nished. After his illness he looked rather thin- \nner that day than on the field of Olmiitz where \nBolkonski had seen him for the first time \nabroad, but there was still the same bewitching \ncombination of majesty and mildness in his \nfine gray eyes, and on his delicate lips the same \ncapacity for varying expression and the same \nprevalent appearance of goodhearted innocent \nyouth. \n\nAt the Olmiitz review he had seemed more \nmajestic; here he seemed brighter and more \nenergetic. He was slightly flushed after gallop- \ning two miles, and reining in his horse he \nsighed restfully and looked round at the faces \nof his suite, young and animated as his own. \nCzartoryski, Novosiltsev, Prince Volk6nsky, \nStr6gonov, and the others, all richly dressed \ngay young men on splendid, well-groomed, \nfresh, only slightly heated horses, exchanging \nremarks and smiling, had stopped behind the \nEmperor. The Emperor Francis, a rosy, long- \nfaced young man, sat very erect on his hand- \nsome black horse, looking about him in a lei- \nsurely and preoccupied manner. He beckoned \nto one of his white adjutants and asked some \nquestion"Most likely he is asking at what \no'clock they started," thought Prince Andrew, \nwatching his old acquaintance with a smile he \ncould not repress as he recalled his reception \nat Brtinn. In the Emperors' suite were the \npicked young orderly officers of the Guard and \nline regiments, Russian and Austrian. Among \nthem were grooms leading the Tsar's beautiful \nrelay horses covered with embroidered cloths. \n\nAs when a window is opened a whiff of fresh \nair from the fields enters a stuffy room, so a \nwhiff of youthfulness, energy, and confidence \nof success reached Kutuzov's cheerless staff \nwith the galloping advent of all these brilliant \nyoung men. \n\n"Why aren't you beginning, Michael Ilari6n- \novich?" said the Emperor Alexander hurried- \nly to Kutuzov, glancing courteously at the \nsame time at the Emperor Francis. \n\n"I am waiting, Your Majesty," answered Ku- \ntuzov, bending forward respectfully. \n\nThe Emperor, frowning slightly, bent his \near forward as if he had not quite heard. \n\n"Waiting, Your Majesty," repeated Kutiizov. \n(Prince Andrew noted that Kutiizov's upper \nlip twitched unnaturally as he said the word \n"waiting.") "Not all the columns have formed \nup yet, Your Majesty." \n\nThe Tsar heard but obviously did not like \nthe reply; he shrugged his rather round shoul- \n\n\n\nders and glanced at Novosiltsev who was near \nhim, as if complaining of Kutiizov. \n\n"You know, Michael Ilari6novich, we are not \non the Empress' Field where a parade does not \nbegin till all the troops are assembled," said \nthe Tsar with another glance at the Emperor \nFrancis, as if inviting him if not to join in at \nleast to listen to what he was saying. But the \nEmperor Francis continued to look about him \nand did not listen. \n\n"That is just why I do not begin, sire," said \nKutuzov in a resounding voice, apparently to \npreclude the possibility of not being heard, \nand again something in his face twitched \n"That is just why I do not begin, sire, because \nwe are not on parade and not on the Empress' \nField," said he clearly and distinctly. \n\nIn the Emperor's suite all exchanged rapid \nlooks that expressed dissatisfaction and re- \nproach. "Old though he may be, he should not, \nhe certainly should not, speak like that," their \nglances seemed to say. \n\nThe Tsar looked intently and observantly \ninto Kutuzov's eye waiting to hear whether he \nwould say anything more. But Kutuzov, with \nrespectfully bowed head, seemed also to be \nwaiting. The silence lasted for about a min- \nute. \n\n"However, if you command it, Your Majes- \nty," said Kutiizov, lifting his head and again \nassuming his former tone of a dull, unreason- \ning, but submissive general. \n\nHe touched his horse and having called Mil- \norddovich, the commander of the column, gave \nhim the order to advance. \n\nThe troops again began to move, and two \nbattalions of the N6vgorod and one of the Ap- \nsheron regiment went forward past the Emper- \nor. \n\nAs this Apsheron battalion marched by, the \nred- faced Milorddovich, without his greatcoat, \nwith his Orders on his breast and an enormous \ntuft of plumes in his cocked hat worn on one \nside with its corners front and back, galloped \nstrenuously forward, and with a dashing salute \nreined in his horse before the Emperor. \n\n"God be with you, general!" said the Em- \nperor. \n\n"Ma foi, sire, nous ferons ce qui sera dans \nnoire possibility, sire"' 1 he answered gaily, \nraising nevertheless ironic smiles among the \ngentlemen of the Tsar's suite by his poor \nFrench. \n\nMilorddovich wheeled his horse sharply and \n\n1 "Indeed, Sire, we shall do everything that it is \npossible to do, Sire." \n\n\n\nBOOK \n\nstationed himself a little behind the Emperor. \nThe Apsheron men, excited by the Tsar's pres- \nence, passed in step before the Emperors and \ntheir suites at a bold, brisk pace. \n\n"Lads 1" shouted Milorddovich in a loud, self- \nconfident, and cheery voice, obviously so elat- \ned by the sound of firing, by the prospect of \nbattle, and by the sight of the gallant Apsher- \nons, his comrades in Suv6rov's time, now \npassing so gallantly before the Emperors, \nthat he forgot the sovereigns' presence. "Lads, \nit's not the first village you've had to take," \ncried he. \n\n"Glad to do our best!" shouted the soldiers. \n\nThe Emperor's horse started at the sudden \ncry. This horse that had carried the sovereign \nat reviews in Russia bore him also here on the \nfield of Austerlitz, enduring the heedless blows \nof his left foot and pricking its ears at the sound \nof shots just as it had done on the Empress' Field, \nnot understanding the significance of the fir- \ning, nor of the nearness of the Emperor Fran- \ncis' black cob, nor of all that was being said, \nthought, and felt that day by its rider. \n\nThe Emperor turned with a smile to one of \nhis followers and made a remark to him, point- \ning to the gallant Apsherons. \n\nCHAPTER XVI \n\nKUTI/ZOV accompanied by his adjutants rode \nat a walking pace behind the carabineers. \n\nWhen he had gone less than half a mile in \nthe rear of the column he stopped at a solitary, \ndeserted house that had probably once been an \ninn, where two roads parted. Both of them led \ndownhill and troops were marching along \nboth. \n\nThe fog had begun to clear and enemy \ntroops were already dimly visible about a mile \nand a half off on the opposite heights. Down \nbelow, on the left, the firing became more dis- \ntinct. Kutiizov had stopped and was speaking \nto an Austrian general. Prince Andrew, who \nwas a little behind and looking at them, turned \nto an adjutant to ask him for a field glass. \n\n"Look, look! "said this adjutant, looking not \nat the troops in the distance, but down the hill \nbefore him. "It's the French!" \n\nThe two generals and the adjutant took hold \nof the field glass, trying to snatch it from one \nanother. The expression on all their faces sud- \ndenly changed to one of horror. The French \nwere supposed to be a mile and a half away, \nbut had suddenly and unexpectedly appeared \njust in front of us. \n\n"It's the enemy? . . . No! . . . Yes, see it isl \n\n\n\nTHREE 155 \n\n... for certain. . . . But how is that?" said dif- \nferent voices. \n\nWith the naked eye Prince Andrew saw be- \nlow them to the right, not more than five hun- \ndred paces from where Kutiizov was standing, \na dense French column coining up to meet the \nApsherons. *&gt; \n\n"Here it is! The decisive moment has arrived. \nMy turn has come," thought Prince Andrew, \nand striking his horse he rode up to Kutiizov. \n\n"The Apsherons must be stopped, your ex- \ncellency," cried he. But at that very instant a \ncloud of smoke spread all round, firing was \nheard quite close at hand, and a voice of naive \nterror barely two steps from Prince Andrew \nshouted, "Brothers! All's lost!" And at this \nvoice, as if at a command, everyone began to \nrun. \n\nConfused and ever-increasing crowds were \nrunning back to where five minutes before the \ntroops had passed the Emperors. Not only \nwould it have been difficult to stop that crowd, \nit was even impossible not to be carried back \nwith it oneself. Bolk6nski only tried not to lose \ntouch with it, and looked around bewildered \nand unable to grasp what was happening in \nfront of him. Nesvftski with an angry face, red \nand unlike himself, was shouting to Kutiizov \nthat if he did not ride away at once he would \ncertainly be taken prisoner. Kutiizov remained \nin the same place and without answering drew \nout a handkerchief. Blood was flowing from \nhis cheek. Prince Andrew forced his way to \nhim. \n\n"You are wounded?" he asked, hardly able \nto master the trembling of his lower jaw. \n\n"The wound is not here, it is there!" said \nKutiizov, pressing the handkerchief to his \nwounded cheek and pointing to the fleeing \nsoldiers. "Stop them!" he shouted, and at the \nsame moment, probably realizing that it was \nimpossible to stop them, spurred his horse and \nrode to the right. \n\nA fresh wave of the flying mob caught him \nand bore him back with it. \n\nThe troops were running in such a dense \nmass that once surrounded by them it was dif- \nficult to get out again. One was shouting, "Get \non! Why are you hinderingus?" Another in the \nsame place turned round and fired in the air; a \nthird was striking the horse Kutiizov himself \nrode. Having by a great effort got away to the \nleft from that flood of men, Kutiizov, with his \nsuite diminished by more than half, rode to- \nward a sound of artillery fire near by. Having \nforced his way out of the crowd of fugitives, \n\n\n\n156 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nPrince Andrew, trying to keep near Kutuzov, \nsaw on the slope of the hill amid the smoke a \nRussian battery that was still firingand French- \nmen running toward it. Higher up stood some \nRussian infantry, neither moving forward to \nprotect the battery nor backward with the flee- \ning crowd. A mounted general separated him- \nself from the infantry and approached Kuttizov. \nOf Kutrizov's suite only four remained. They \nwere all pale and exchanged looks in silence. \n\n"Stop those wretches 1" gasped Kutuzov to \nthe regimental commander, pointing to the \nflying soldiers; but at that instant, as if to pun- \nish him for those words, bullets flew hissing \nacross the regiment and across Kutiizov's suite \nlike a flock of little birds. \n\nThe French had attacked the battery and, \nseeing Kutuzov, were firing at him. After this \nvolley the regimental commander clutched at \nhis leg; several soldiers fell, and a second lieu- \ntenant who was holding the flag let it fall from \nhis hands. It swayed and fell, but caught on the \nmuskets of the nearest soldiers. The soldiers \nstarted firing without orders. \n\n"Oh! Oh! Oh I 1 ' groaned Kutuzov despairing- \nly and looked around. . . . "Bolk6nski!" he \nwhispered, his voice trembling from a con- \nsciousness of the feebleness of age, "Bolk6nski ! " \nhe whispered, pointing to the disordered bat- \ntalion and at the enemy, "what's that?" \n\nBut before he had finished speaking, Prince \nAndrew, feeling tears of shame and anger \nchoking him, had already leapt from his horse \nand run to the standard. \n\n"Forward, lads!" he shouted in a voice pierc- \ning as a child's. \n\n"Here it is!" thought he, seizing the staff of \nthe standard and hearing with pleasure the \nwhistle of 'bullets evidently aimed at him. Sev- \neral soldiers fell. \n\n"Hurrah!" shouted Prince Andrew, and, \nscarcely able to hold up the heavy standard, he \nran forward with full confidence that the whole \nbattalion would follow him. \n\nAnd really he only ran a few steps alone. \nOne soldier moved and then another and soon \nthe whole battalion ran forward shouting "Hur- \nrah!" and overtook him. A sergeant of the bat- \ntalion ran up and took the flag that was sway- \ning from its weight in Prince Andrew's hands, \nbut he was immediately killed. Prince Andrew \nagain seized the standard and, dragging it by \nthe staff, ran on with the battalion. In front he \nsaw our artillerymen, some of whom were fight- \ning, while others, having abandoned theirguns, \nwere running toward him. He also saw French \n\n\n\ninfantry soldiers who were seizing the artillery \nhorses and turning the guns round. Prince An- \ndrew and the battalion were already within \ntwenty paces of the cannon. He heard the whis- \ntle of bullets above him unceasingly and to \nright and left of him soldiers continually \ngroaned and dropped. But he did not look at \nthem: he looked only at what was going on in \nfront of him at the battery. He now saw clear- \nly the figure of a red-haired gunner with his \nshako knocked awry, pulling one end of a mop \nwhile a French soldier tugged at the other. He \ncould distinctly see the distraught yet angry \nexpression on the faces of these two men, \nwho evidently did not realize what they were \ndoing. \n\n"What are they about?" thought Prince An- \ndrew as he gazed at them. "Why doesn't the \nred-haired gunner run away as he is unarmed? \nWhy doesn't the Frenchman stab him? He will \nnot get away before the Frenchman remembers \nhis bayonet and stabs him. . . ." \n\nAnd really another French soldier, trailing \nhis musket, ran up to the struggling men, and \nthe fate of the red-haired gunner, who had tri- \numphantly secured the mop and still did not \nrealize what awaited him, was about to be de- \ncided. But Prince Andrew did not see how it \nended. It seemed to him as though one of the \nsoldiers near him hit him on the head with the \nfull swing of a bludgeon. It hurt a little, but \nthe worst of it was that the pain distracted him \nand prevented his seeing what he had been \nlooking at. \n\n"What's this? Am I falling? My legs are giv- \ning way," thought he, and fell on his back. He \nopened his eyes, hoping to see how the strug- \ngle of the Frenchmen with the gunners ended, \nwhether the red-haired gunner had been killed \nor not and whether the cannon had been cap- \ntured or saved. But he saw nothing. Above \nhim there was now nothing but the sky the \nlofty sky, not clear yet still immeasurably lofty, \nwith gray clouds gliding slowly across it. "How \nquiet, peaceful, and solemn; notat all as I ran," \nthought Prince Andrew "not as we ran, shout- \ning and fighting, not at all as the gunner and \nthe Frenchman with frightened and angry \nfaces struggled for the mop: how differently do \nthose clouds glide across that lofty infinite sky! \nHow was it I did not see that lofty sky before? \nAnd how happy I am to have found it at last! \nYes! All is vanity, all falsehood, except that in- \nfinite sky. There is nothing, nothing, but that. \nBut even it does not exist, there is nothing but \nquiet and peace. Thank God! . . ." \n\n\n\nBOOK THREE \n\n\n\n'57 \n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII \n\nON OUR RIGHT FLANK commanded by Bagrati6n, \nat nine o'clock the battle had not yet begun. \nNot wishing to agree to Dolgorukov's demand \nto commence the action, and wishing to avert \nresponsibility from himself, Prince Bagrati6n \nproposed to Dolgorukov to send to inquire of \nthe commander in chief. Bagrati6n knew that \nas the distance between the two flanks was \nmore than six miles, even if the messenger \nwere not killed (which he very likely would \nbe), and found the commander in chief (which \nwould be very difficult), he would not be able \nto get back before evening. \n\nBagrati6n cast his large, expressionless, sleepy \neyes round his suite, and the boyish face of Ros- \ntov, breathless with excitement and hope, was \nthe first to catch his eye. He sent him. \n\n"And if I should meet His Majesty before I \nmeet the commander in chief, your excellency?" \nsaid Rost6v, with his hand to his cap. \n\n"You can give the message to His Majesty," \nsaid Dolgorukov, hurriedly interrupting Ba- \ngrati6n. \n\nOn being relieved from picket duty Rost6v \nhad managed to get a few hours' sleep before \nmorning and felt cheerful, bold, and resolute, \nwith elasticity of movement, faith in his good \nfortune, and generally in that state of mind \nwhich makes everything seem possible, pleas- \nant, and easy. \n\nAll his wishes were being fulfilled that morn- \ning: there was to be a general engagement in \nwhich he was taking part, more than that, he \nwas orderly to the bravest general, and still \nmore, he was going with a message to Kutiizov, \nperhaps even to the sovereign himself. The \nmorning was bright, he had a good horse under \nhim, and his heart was full of joy and happi- \nness. On receiving the order he gave his horse \nthe rein and galloped along the line. At first \nhe rode along the line of Bagrati6n's troops, \nwhich had not yet advanced into action but \nwere standing motionless; then he came to the \nregion occupied by Uvarov's cavalry and here \nhe noticed a stir and signs of preparation for \nbattle; having passed Uvarov's cavalry he clear- \nly heard the sound of cannon and musketry \nahead of him. The firing grew louder and loud- \ner. \n\nIn the fresh morning air were now heard, \nnot two or three musket shots at irregular in- \ntervals as before, followed by one or two can- \nnon shots, but a roll of volleys of musketry \nfrom the slopes of the hill before Pratzen, in- \nterrupted by such frequent reports of cannon \n\n\n\nthat sometimes several of them were not sep- \narated from one another but merged into a \ngeneral roar. \n\nHe could see puffs of musketry smoke that \nseemed to chase one another down the hill- \nsides, and clouds of cannon smoke rolling, \nspreading, and mingling with one another. He \ncould also, by the gleam of bayonets visible \nthrough the smoke, make out moving masses \nof infantry and narrow lines of artillery with \ngreen caissons. \n\nRost6v stopped his horse for a moment on a \nhillock to see what was going on, but strain his \nattention as he would he could not understand \nor make out anything of what was happening: \nthere in the smoke men of some sort were mov- \ning about, and in front and behind moved lines \nof troops; but why, whither, and who they were, \nit was impossible to make out. These sights and \nsounds had no depressing or intimidating ef- \nfect on him; on the contrary, they stimulated \nhis energy and determination. \n\n"Go on! Go on! Give it them!" he mentally \nexclaimed at these sounds, and again proceed- \ned to gallop along the line, penetrating farther \nand farther into the region where the army \nwas already in action. \n\n"How it will be there I don't know, but all \nwill be well!" thought Rost6v. \n\nAfter passing some Austrian troops he no- \nticed that the next part of the line (the Guards) \nwas already in action. \n\n"So much the better! I shall see it close," he \nthought. \n\nHe was riding almost along the front line. A \nhandful of men came galloping toward him. \nThey were our Uhlans who with disordered \nranks were returning from the attack. Rost6v \ngot out of their way, involuntarily noticed that \none of them was bleeding, and galloped on. \n\n"That is no business of mine," he thought. \nHe had not ridden many hundred yards after \nthat before he saw to his left, across the whole \nwidth of the field, an enormous mass of caval- \nry in brilliant white uniforms, mounted on \nblack horses, trotting straight toward him and \nacross his path. Rostov put his horse to full \ngallop to get out of the way of these men, and \nhe would have got clear had they continued at \nthe same speed, but they kept increasing their \npace, so that some of the horses were already \ngalloping. Rost6v heard the thud of their hoofs \nand the jingle of their weapons and saw their \nhorses, their figures, and even their faces, \nmore and more distinctly. They were our \nHorse Guards, advancing to attack the French \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\ncavalry that was coming to meet them. \n\nThe Horse Guards were galloping, but still \nholding in their horses. Rost6v could already \nsee their faces and heard the command: \n"Charge! "shouted by an officer who was urging \nhis thoroughbred to full speed. Rost6v, fearing \nto be crushed or swept into the attack on the \nFrench, galloped along the front as hard as his \nhorse could go, but still was not in time to avoid \nthem. \n\nThe last of the Horse Guards, a huge pock- \nmarked fellow, frowned angrily on seeing Ros- \nt6v before him, with whom he would inevita- \nbly collide. This Guardsman would certainly \nhave bowled Rost6v and his Bedouin over \n(Rost6v felt himself quite tiny and weak com- \npared to these gigantic men and horses) had it \nnot occurred to Rost6v to flourish his whip be- \nfore the eyes of the Guardsman's horse. The \nheavy black horse, sixteen hands high, shied, \nthrowing back its ears; but the pockmarked \nGuardsman drove his huge spurs in violently, \nand the horse, flourishing its tail and extending \nits neck, galloped on yet faster. Hardly had the \nHorse Guards passed Rost6v before he heard \nthem shout, "Hurrah!" and looking back saw \nthat their foremost ranks were mixed up with \nsome foreign cavalry with red epaulets, prob- \nably French. He could see nothing more, for \nimmediately afterwards cannon began firing \nfrom somewhere and smoke enveloped every- \nthing. \n\nAt that moment, as the Horse Guards, hav- \ning passed him, disappeared in the smoke, Ros- \nt6v hesitated whether to gallop after them or \nto go where he was sent. This was the brilliant \ncharge of the Horse Guards that amazed the \nFrench themselves. Rost6v was horrified to \nhear later that of all that mass of huge and \nhandsome men, of all those brilliant, rich \nyouths, officers and cadets, who had galloped \npast him on their thousand-ruble horses, only \neighteen were left after the charge. \n\n"Why should I envy them? My chance is not \nlost, ancUnaybe I shall see the Emperor imme- \ndiately!" thojught Rost6v and galloped on. \n\nWhen he came level with the Foot Guards \nhe noticed that about them and around them \ncannon balls were flying, of which he was \naware not so much because he heard their \nsound as because he saw uneasiness on the sol- \ndiers' faces and unnatural warlike solemnity \non those of the officers. \n\nPassing behind one of the lines of a regiment \nof Foot Guards he heard a voice calling him \nby name. \n\n\n\n"Rost6v!" \n\n"What?" he answered, not recognizing Boris. \n\n"I say, we've been in the front line! Our reg- \niment attacked!" said Boris with the happy \nsmile seen on the faces of young men who have \nbeen under fire for the first time. \n\nRost6v stopped. \n\n"Have you?" he said. "Well, how did it go?" \n\n"We drove them back!" said Boris with an- \nimation, growing talkative. "Can you imagine \nit?" and he began describing how the Guards, \nhaving taken up their position and seeing \ntroops before them, thought they were Austri- \nans, and all at once discovered from the cannon \nballs discharged by those troops that they were \nthemselves in the front line and had unexpect- \nedly to go into action. RostcW without hearing \nBoris to the end spurred his horse. \n\n"Where are you off to?" asked Boris. \n\n"With a message to His Majesty." \n\n"There he is!" said Boris, thinking Rost6v \nhad said "His Highness," and pointing to the \nGrand Duke who with his high shoulders and \nfrowning brows stood a hundred paces away \nfrom them in his helmet and Horse Guards' \njacket, shouting something to a pale, white- \nuniformed Austrian officer. \n\n"But that's the Grand Duke, and I want the \ncommander in chief or the Emperor," said \nRost6v, and was about to spur his horse. \n\n"Count! Count!" shouted Berg who ran up \nfrom the other side as eager as Boris. "Count! \nI am wounded in my right hand" (and he \nshowed his bleeding hand with a handkerchief \ntied round it) "and I remained at the front. I \nheld my sword in my left hand, Count. All oui \nfamily the von Bergs have been knights!" \n\nHe said something more, but Rost6v did \nnot wait to hear it and rode away. \n\nHaving passed the Guards and traversed an \nempty space, Rostov, to avoid again getting in \nfront of the first line as he had done when the \nHorse Guards charged, followed the line of \nreserves, going far round the place where the \nhottest musket fire and cannonade were heard. \nSuddenly he heard musket fire quite close in \nfront of him and behind our troops, where he \ncould never have expected the enemy to be. \n\n"What can it be?" he thought. "The enemy \nin the rear of our army? Impossible!" And sud- \ndenly he was seized by a panic of fear for him- \nself and for the issue of the whole battle. "But \nbe that what it may," he reflected, "there is no \nriding round it now. I must look for the com- \nmander in chief here, and if all is lost it is for \nme to perish with the rest." \n\n\n\nBOOK THREE \n\n\n\nThe foreboding of evil that had suddenly \ncome over Rost6v was more and more con- \nfirmed the farther he rode into the region be- \nhind the village of Pratzen, which was full of \ntroops of all kinds. \n\n"What does it mean? What is it? Whom are \nthey firing at? Who is firing?" Rost6v kept ask- \ning as he came up to Russian and Austrian sol- \ndiers running in confused crowds across his \npath. \n\n"The devil knowsl They've killed everybody! \nIt's all up nowl" he was told in Russian, Ger- \nman, and Czech by the crowd of fugitives who \nunderstood what was happening as little as he \ndid. \n\n"Kill the Germans!" shouted one. \n\n"May the devil take them the traitors!" \n\n"Zum Henker diese Russen!" l muttered a \nGerman. \n\nSeveral wounded men passed along the road, \nand words of abuse, screams, and groans min- \ngled in a general hubbub, then the firing died \ndown. Rost6v learned later that Russian and \nAustrian soldiers had been firing at one anoth- \ner. \n\n"My God! What does it all mean?" thought \nhe. "And here, where at any moment the Em- \nperor may see them. . . . But no, these must be \nonly a handful of scoundrels. It will soon be \nover, it can't be that, it can't be! Only to get \npast them quicker, quicker! " \n\nThe idea of defeat and flight could not en- \nter Rostov's head. Though he saw French can- \nnon and French troops on the Pratzen Heights \njust where he had been ordered to look for the \ncommander in chief, he could not, did not \nwish to, believe that. \n\nCHAPTER XVIII \n\nRosx6v had been ordered to look for Kutuzov \nand the Emperor near the village of Pratzen. \nBut neither they nor a single commanding of- \nficer were there, only disorganized crowds of \ntroops of various kinds. He urged on his al- \nready weary horse to get quickly past these \ncrowds, but the farther he went the more dis- \norganized they were. The highroad on which \nhe had come out was thronged with caliches, \ncarriages of all sorts, and Russian and Austri- \nan soldiers of all arms, some wounded and \nsome not. This whole mass droned and jostled \nin confusion under the dismal influence of \ncannon balls flying from the French batteries \nstationed on the Pratzen Heights. \n\n"Where is the Emperor? Where is Kutuzov?" \n\n1 "Hang these Russians!" \n\n\n\nRost6v kept asking everyone he could stop \nbut got no answer from anyone. \n\nAt last seizing a soldier by his collar he forcec \nhim to answer. \n\n"Eh, brother! They've all bolted long ago!' \nsaid the soldier, laughing for some reason anc \nshaking himself free. \n\nHaving left that soldier who was evidently \ndrunk, Rost6v stopped the horse of a batmar \nor groom of some important personage and be \ngan to question him. The man announcec \nthat the Tsar had been driven in a carriage ai \nfull speed about an hour before along thatver \nroad and that he was dangerously wounded. \n\n"It can't be!" said Rost6v. "It must hav&lt; \nbeen someone else." \n\n"I saw him myself," replied the man with ; \nself-confident smile of derision. "I ought tc \nknow the Emperor by now, after the times I'v&lt; \nseen him in Petersburg. I saw him just as I se&lt; \nyou. . . . There he sat in the carriage as pale a \nany thing. How they made the four black horse \nfly! Gracious me, they did rattle past! It's tim&lt; \nI knew the Imperial horses and Ilya Ivdnych. \ndon't think Ilya drives anyone except th&lt; \nTsar!" \n\nRost6v let go of the horse and was about t&lt; \nride on, when a wounded officer passing by ad \ndressed him: \n\n"Who is it you want?" he asked. "The com \nmander in chief? He was killed by a cannoi \nball struck in the breast before our regiment. 1 \n\n"Not killed wounded!" another officer coi \nreeled him. \n\n"Who? Kutuzov?" asked Rost6v. \n\n"Not Kutuzov, but what's his name well \nnever mind . . . there are not many left alive \nGo that way, to that village, all the command \ners are there," said the officer, pointing to th&lt; \nvillage of Hosjeradek, and he walked on. \n\nRost6v rode on at a footpace not knowin] \nwhy or to whom he was now going. The Em \nperor was wounded, the battle lost. It was im \npossible to doubt it now. Rost6v rode in th \ndirection pointed out to him, in which he sa\ \nturrets and a church. What need to hurry \nWhat was he now to say to the Tsar or to Ku \ntiizov, even if they were alive and un wounded \n\n"Take this road, your honor, that way yoi \nwill be killed at oncel" a soldier shouted t&lt; \nhim. "They'd kill you there!" \n\n"Oh, what are you talking about?" said an \nother. "Where is he to go? That way is nearer. \n\nRost6v considered, and then went in the di \nrection where they said he would be killed. \n\n"It's all the same now. If the Emperor i \n\n\n\ni6o \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nwounded, am I to try to save myself?" he \nthought. He rode on to the region where the \ngreatest number of men had perished in flee- \ning from Pratzen. The French had not yet oc- \ncupied that region, and the Russians the un- \ninjured and slightly woundedhad left it long \nago. All about the field, like heaps of manure \non well-kept plowland, lay from ten to fifteen \ndead and wounded to each couple of acres. The \nwounded crept together in twos and threes and \none could hear their distressing screams and \ngroans, sometimes feigned or so it seemed to \nRost6v. He put his horse to a trot to avoid see- \ning all these suffering men, and he felt afraid- \nafraid not for his life, but for the courage he \nneeded and which he knew would not stand \nthe sight of these unfortunates. \n\nThe French, who had ceased firing at this \nfield strewn with dead and wounded where \nthere was no one left to fire at, on seeing an \nadjutant riding over it trained a gun on him \nand fired several shots. The sensation of those \nterrible whistling sounds and of the corpses \naround him merged in Rost6v's mind into a \nsingle feeling of terror and pity for himself. \nHe remembered his mother's last letter. "What \nwould she feel," thought he, "if she saw me \nhere now on this field with the cannon aimed \nat me?" \n\nIn the village of Hosjeradek there were Rus- \nsian troops retiring from the field of battle, \nwho though still in some confusion were less \ndisordered. The French cannon did not reach \nthere and the musketry fire sounded far away. \nHere everyone clearly saw and said that the \nbattle was lost. No one whom Rost6v asked \ncould tell him where the Emperor or Kuttizov \nwas. Some said the report that the Emperor \nwas wounded was correct, others that it was \nnot, and explained the false rumor that had \nspread by the fact that the Emperor's carriage \nhad really galloped from the field of battle \nwith the pale and terrified Ober-Hofmarschal \nCount Tolst6y, who had ridden out to the bat- \ntlefield with others in the Emperor's suite. One \nofficer told Rost6v that he had seen someone \nfrom headquarters behind the village to the \nleft, and thither Rost6v rode, not hoping to \nfind anyone but merely to ease his conscience. \nWhen he had ridden about two miles and had \npassed the last of the Russian troops, he saw, \nnear a kitchen garden with a ditch round it, \ntwo men on horseback facing the ditch. One \nwith a white plume in his hat seemed familiar \nto Rostov; the other on a beautiful chestnut \nhorse (which Rost6v fancied he had seen be- \n\n\n\nfore) rode up to the ditch, struck his horse with \nhis spurs, and giving it the rein leaped lightly \nover. Only a little earth crumbled from the \nbank under the horse's hind hoofs. Turning \nthe horse sharply, he again jumped the ditch, \nand deferentially addressed the horseman with \nthe white plumes, evidently suggesting that he \nshould do the same. The rider, whose figure \nseemed familiar to Rost6v and involuntarily \nriveted his attention, made a gesture of refusal \nwith his head and hand and by that gesture \nRost6v instantly recognized his lamented and \nadored monarch. \n\n"But it can't be he, alone in the midst of this \nempty field 1" thought Rost6v. At that moment \nAlexander turned his head and Rost6v saw the \nbeloved features that were so deeply engraved \non his memory. The Emperor was pale, his \ncheeks sunken and his eyes hollow, but the \ncharm, the mildness of his features, was all the \ngreater. Rost6v was happy in the assurance \nthat the rumors about the Emperor being \nwounded were false. He was happy to be see- \ning him. He knew that he might and even ought \nto go straight to him and give the message Dol- \ngorukov had ordered him to deliver. \n\nBut as a youth in love trembles, is unnerved, \nand dares not utter the thoughts he has dreamed \nof for nights, but looks around for help or a \nchance of delay and flight when the longed-for \nmoment comes and he is alone with her, so \nRost6v, now that he had attained what he had \nlonged for more than anything else in the \nworld, did not know how to approach the Em- \nperor, and a thousand reasons occurred to him \nwhy it would be inconvenient, unseemly, and \nimpossible to do so. \n\n"What I It is as if I were glad of a chance to \ntake advantage of his being alone and de- \nspondent! A strange face may seem unpleasant \nor painful to him at this moment of sorrow; \nbesides, what can I say to him now, when my \nheart fails me and my mouth feels dry at the \nmere sight of him?" Not one of the innumer- \nable speeches addressed to the Emperor that \nhe had composed in his imagination could he \nnow recall. Those speeches were intended for \nquite other conditions, they were for the most \npart to be spoken at a moment of victory and \ntriumph, generally when he was dying of \nwounds and the sovereign had thanked him \nfor heroic deeds, and while dying he expressed \nthe love his actions had proved. \n\n"Besides how can I ask the Emperor for his \ninstructions for the right flank now that it is \nnearly four o'clock and the battle is lost? No, \n\n\n\nBOOK THREE \n\n\n\n161 \n\n\n\ncertainly I must not approach him, I must not \nintrude on his reflections. Better die a thou- \nsand times than risk receiving an unkind look \nor bad opinion from him," Rost6v decided; \nand sorrowfully and with a heart full of despair \nhe rode away, continually looking back at the \nTsar, who still remained in the same attitude \nof indecision. \n\nWhile Rost6v was thus arguing with him- \nself and riding sadly away, Captain von Toll \nchanced to ride to the same spot, and seeing \nthe Emperor at once rode up to him, offered \nhis services, and assisted him to cross the ditch \non foot. The Emperor, wishing to rest and feel- \ning unwell, sat down under an apple tree and \nvon Toll remained beside him. Rost6v from a \ndistance saw with envy and remorse how von \nToll spoke long and warmly to the Emperor \nand how the Emperor, evidently weeping, cov- \nered his eyes with his hand and pressed von \nToll's hand. \n\n"And I might have been in his place!" \nthought Rostov, and hardly restraining his \ntears of pity for the Emperor, he rode on in \nutter despair, not knowing where to or why he \nwas now riding. \n\nHis despair was all the greater from feeling \nthat his own weakness was the cause of his grief. \n\nHe might . . . not only might but should, \nhave gone up to the sovereign. It was a unique \nchance to show his devotion to the Emperor \n\nand he had not made use of it "What have \n\nI done?" thought he. And he turned round \nand galloped back to the place where he had \nseen the Emperor, but there was no one be- \nyond the ditch now. Only some carts and car- \nriages were passing by. From one of the drivers \nhe learned that Kutuzov's staff were not far off, \nin the village the vehicles were going to. Ros- \ntov followed them. In front of him walked Ku- \ntuzov's groom leading horses in horsecloths. \nThen came a cart, and behind that walked an \nold, bandy-legged domestic serf in a peaked \ncap and sheepskin coat. \n\n"Tit! I say, Tit!" said the groom. \n\n"What?" answered the old man absent-mind- \nedly. \n\n"Go, Tit! Thresh a bit!" \n\n"Oh, you fool!" said the old man, spitting \nangrily. Some time passed in silence, and then \nthe same joke was repeated. \n\nBefore five in the evening the battle had \nbeen lost at all points. More than a hundred \ncannon were already in the hands of the French. \n\nPrzebyszlwski and his corps had laid down \n\n\n\ntheir arms. Other columns after losing half \ntheir men were retreating in disorderly con- \nfused masses. \n\nThe remains of Langeron's andDokhtiirov's \nmingled forces were crowding around thedams \nand banks of the ponds near the village of* \nAugesd. \n\nAfter five o'clock it was only at the Augesd \nDam that a hot cannonade (delivered by the \nFrench alone) was still to be heard from nu- \nmerous batteries ranged on the slopes of the \nPratzen Heights, directed at our retreating \nforces. \n\nIn the rearguard, Dokhtiirov and others ral- \nlying some battalions kept up a musketry fire \nat the French cavalry that was pursuing our \ntroops. It was growing dusk. On the narrow \nAugesd Dam where for so many years the old \nmiller had been accustomed tositinhistasseled \ncap peacefully angling, while his grandson, \nwith shirt sleeves rolled up, handled the floun- \ndering silvery fish in the watering can, on that \ndam over which for so many years Moravians \nin shaggy caps and blue jackets had peacefully \ndriven their two-horse carts loaded with wheat \nand had returned dusty with flour whitening \ntheir carts on that narrow dam amid the wag- \nons and the cannon, under the horses' hoofs \nand between the wagon wheels, men disfigured \nby fear of death now crowded together, crush- \ning one another, dying, stepping over the dy- \ning and killing one another, only to move on a \nfew steps and be killed themselves in the same \nway. \n\nEvery ten seconds a cannon ball flew com- \npressing the air around, or a shell burst in the \nmidst of that dense throng, killing some and \nsplashing with blood those near them. \n\nD61okhov now an officer wounded in the \narm, and on foot, with the regimental com- \nmander on horseback and some ten men of \nhis company, represented all that was left of \nthat whole regiment. Impelled by the crowd, \nthey had got wedged in at the approach to the \ndam and, jammed in on all sides, had stopped \nbecause a horse in front had fallen under a \ncannon and the crowd were dragging it out. A \ncannon ball killed someone behind them, an- \nother fell in front and splashed D61okhov with \nblood. The crowd, pushing forward desperate- \nly, squeezed together, moved a few steps, and \nagain stopped. \n\n"Move on a hundred yards and we are cer- \ntainly saved, remain here another two minutes \nand it is certain death," thought each one. \n\nD61okhov who was in the midst of the crowd \n\n\n\n162 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nforced his way to the edge of the dam, throw- \ning two soldiers off their feet, and ran onto the \nslippery ice that covered the millpool. \n\n"Turn this way!" he shouted, jumping over \nthe ice which creaked under him; "turn this \nway!" he shouted to those with the gun. "It \nbears! . . ." \n\nThe ice bore him but it swayed and creaked, \nand it was plain that it would give way not on- \nly under a cannon or a crowd, but very soon \neven under his weight alone. The men looked \nat him and pressed to the bank, hesitating to \nstep onto the ice. The general on horseback at \nthe entrance to the dam raised his hand and \nopened his mouth to address D61okhov. Sud- \ndenly a cannon ball hissed so low above the \ncrowd that everyone ducked. It flopped into \nsomething moist, and the general fell from his \nhorse in a pool of blood. Nobody gave him a \nlook or thought of raising him. \n\n"Get onto the ice, over the ice! Go on! \nTurn! Don't you hear? Go on!" innumerable \nvoices suddenly shouted after the ball had \nstruck the general, the men themselves not \nknowing what, or why, they were shouting. \n\nOne of the hindmost guns that was going \nonto the dam turned off onto the ice. Crowds \nof soldiers from the dam began running onto \nthe frozen pond. The ice gave way under one \nof the foremost soldiers, and one leg slipped \ninto the water. He tried to right himself but \nfell in up to his waist. The nearest soldiers \nshrank back, the gun driver stopped his horse, \nbut from behind still came the shouts: "Onto \nthe ice, why do you stop? Go on! Go on!" And \ncries of horror were heard in the crowd. The \nsoldiers near the gun waved their arms and \nbeat the horses to make them turn and move \non. The horses moved off the bank. The ice, \nthat had held under those on foot, collapsed \nin a great mass, and some forty men who were \non it dashed, some forward and some back, \ndrowning one another. \n\nStill the cannon balls continued regularly to \nwhistle and flop onto the ice and into the wa- \nter and oftenest of all among the crowd that \ncovered the dam, the pond, and the bank. \n\nCHAPTER XIX \n\nON THE PRATZEN HEIGHTS, where he had fallen \nwith the flagstaff in his hand, lay Prince An- \ndrew Bolk6nski bleeding profusely and un- \nconsciously uttering a gentle, piteous, and \nchildlike moan. \n\nToward evening he ceased moaning and be- \ncame quite still. He did not know how long \n\n\n\nhis unconsciousness lasted. Suddenly he again \nfelt that he was alive and suffering from a burn- \ning, lacerating pain in his head. \n\n"Where is it, that lofty sky that I did not \nknow till now, but saw today?" was his first \nthought. "And I did not know this suffering \neither," he thought. "Yes, I did not know any- \nthing, anything at all till now. But where am \nI?" \n\nHe listened and heard the sound of approach- \ning horses, and voices speaking French. He \nopened his eyes. Above him again was the same \nlofty sky with clouds that had risen and were \nfloating still higher, and between them gleamed \nblue infinity. He did not turn his head and did \nnot see those who, judging by the sound of \nhoofs and voices, had ridden up and stopped \nnear him. \n\nIt was Napoleon accompanied by two aides- \nde-camp. Bonaparte riding over the battlefield \nhad given final orders to strengthen the bat- \nteries firing at the Augesd Dam and was look- \ning at the killed and wounded left on the field. \n\n"Fine men!" remarked Napoleon, looking \nat a dead Russian grenadier, who, with his face \nburied in the ground and a blackened nape, \nlay on his stomach with an already stiffened \narm flung wide. \n\n"The ammunition for the guns in position \nis exhausted, Your Majesty," said an adjutant \nwho had come from the batteries that were fir- \ning at Augesd. \n\n"Have some brought from the reserve," said \nNapoleon, and having gone on a few steps he \nstopped before Prince Andrew, who lay on his \nback with the flagstaff that had been dropped \nbeside him. (The flag had already been taken \nby the French as a trophy.) \n\n"That's a fine death!" said Napoleon as he \ngazed at Bolk6nski. \n\nPrince Andrew understood that this was \nsaid of him and that it was Napoleon who said \nit. He heard the speaker addressed as Sire. But \nhe heard the words as he might have heard the \nbuzzing of a fly. Not only did they not interest \nhim, but he took no notice of them and at once \nforgot them. His head was burning, he felt \nhimself bleeding to death, and he saw above \nhim the remote, lofty, and everlasting sky. He \nknew it was Napoleon his hero but at that \nmoment Napoleon seemed to him such a small, \ninsignificant creature compared with what was \npassing now between himself and that lofty in- \nfinite sky with the clouds flying over it. At that \nmoment it meant nothing to him who might \nbe standing over him, or what was said of him; \n\n\n\nhe was only glad that people were standing \nnear him and only wished that they would help \nhim and bring him back to life, which seemed \nto him so beautiful now that he had today \nlearned to understand it so differently. He col- \nlected all his strength, to stir and utter a sound. \nHe feebly moved his leg and uttered a weak, \nsickly groan which aroused his own pity. \n\n"Ah! He is alive," said Napoleon. "Lift this \nyoung man up and carry him to the dressing \nstation." \n\nHaving said this, Napoleon rode on to meet \nMarshal Lannes, who, hat in hand, rode up \nsmiling to the Emperor to congratulate him \non the victory. \n\nPrince Andrew remembered nothing more: \nhe lost consciousness from the terrible pain of \nbeing lifted onto the stretcher, the jolting \nwhile being moved, and the probing of his \nwound at the dressing station. He did not re- \ngain consciousness till late in the day, when \nwith other wounded and captured Russian of- \nficers he was carried to the hospital. During \nthis transfer he felt a little stronger and was \nable to look about him and even speak. \n\nThe first words he heard on coming to his \nsenses were those of a French convoy officer, \nwho said rapidly: "We must halt here: the Em- \nperor will pass here immediately; it will please \nhim to see these gentlemen prisoners." \n\n"There are so many prisoners today, nearly \nthe whole Russian army, that he is probably \ntired of them," said another officer. \n\n"All the samel They say this one is the com- \nmander of all the Emperor Alexander's \nGuards," said the first one, indicating a Rus- \nsian officer in the white uniform of the Horse \nGuards. \n\nBolk6nski recognized Prince Repnin whom \nhe had met in Petersburg society. Beside him \nstood a lad of nineteen, also a wounded officer \nof the Horse Guards. \n\nBonaparte, having come up at a gallop, \nstopped his horse. \n\n"Which is the senior?" he asked, on seeing \nthe prisoners. \n\nThey named the colonel, Prince Repnfn. \n\n"You are the commander of the Emperor \nAlexander's regiment of Horse Guards?" asked \nNapoleon. \n\n"Icommandedasquadron," replied Repnin. \n\n"Your regiment fulfilled its duty honorably," \nsaid Napoleon. \n\n"The praise of a great commander is a sol- \ndier's highest reward," said Repnin. \n\n"I bestow it with pleasure," said Napoleon. \n\n\n\nBOOK THREE 163 \n\n"And who is that young man beside you?" \n\n\n\nPrince Repnfn named Lieutenant Sukht- \nlen. \n\nAfter looking at him Napoleon smiled. \n\n"He's very young to come to meddle with \nus." \n\n"Youth is no hindrance to courage," mut- \ntered Sukhtlen in a failing voice. \n\n"A splendid reply!" said Napoleon. "Young \nman, you will go far!" \n\nPrince Andrew, who had also been brought \nforward before the Emperor's eyes to complete \nthe show of prisoners, could not fail to attract \nhis attention. Napoleon apparently remem- \nbered seeing him on the battlefield and, ad- \ndressing him, again used the epithet "young \nman" that was connected in his memory with \nPrince Andrew. \n\n"Well, and you, young man," said he. "How \ndo you feel, mon brave?" \n\nThough five minutes before, Prince Andrew \nhad been able to say a few words to the sol- \ndiers who were carrying him, now with his eyes \nfixed straight on Napoleon, he was silent. . . . \nSo insignificant at that moment seemed to him \nall the interests that engrossed Napoleon, so \nmean did his hero himself with his paltry \nvanity and joy in victory appear, compared to \nthe lofty, equitable, and kindly sky which he \nhad seen and understood, that he could not \nanswer him. \n\nEvery thing seemed so futile and insignificant \nin comparison with the stern and solemn train \nof thought that weakness from loss of blood, \nsuffering, and the nearness of death aroused \nin him. Looking into Napoleon's eyes Prince \nAndrew thought of the insignificance of great- \nness, the unimportance of life which no one \ncould understand, and the still greater unim- \nportance of death, the meaning of which no \none alive could understand or explain. \n\nThe Emperor without waiting for an an- \nswer turned away and said to one of the officers \nas he went: "Have these gentlemen attended \nto and taken to my bivouac; let my doctor, Lar- \nrey, examine their wounds. Au revoir, Prince \nRepnfnl" and he spurred his horse and gal- \nloped away. \n\nHis face shone with self-satisfaction and \npleasure. \n\nThe soldiers who had carried Prince An- \ndrew had noticed and taken the little gold icon \nPrincess Mary had hung round her brother's \nneck, but seeing the favor the Emperor showed \nthe prisoners, they now hastened to return the \nholy image. \n\n\n\n164 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nPrince Andrew did not see how and by whom \nit was replaced, but the little icon with its thin \ngold chain suddenly appeared upon his chest \noutside his uniform. \n\n"It would be good," thought Prince Andrew, \nglancing at the icon his sister had hung round \nhis neck with such emotion and reverence, "it \nwould be good if everything were as clear and \nsimple as it seems to Mary. How good it would \nbe to know where to seek for help in this life, \nand what to expect after it beyond the grave! \nHow happy and calm I should be if I could now \nsay: 'Lord, have mercy on me!' . . . But to \nwhom should I say that? Either to a Power in- \ndefinable, incomprehensible, which I not only \ncannot address but which I cannot even ex- \npress in words the Great All or Nothing" \nsaid he to himself, "or to that God who has \n\n\n\nincreased and he grew delirious. Visions of \nhis father, wife, sister, and future son, and \nthe tenderness he had felt the night before \nthe battle, the figure of the insignificant little \nNapoleon, and above all this the lofty sky, \nformed the chief subjects of his delirious \nfancies. \n\nThe quiet home life and peaceful happiness \nof Bald Hills presented itself to him. He was \nalready enjoying that happiness when that lit- \ntle Napoleon had suddenly appeared with his \nunsympathizing look of shortsighted delight at \nthe misery of others, and doubts and torments \nhad followed, and only the heavens promised \npeace. Toward morningall these dreams melted \nand merged into the chaos and darkness of un- \nconsciousenss and oblivion, which in the opin- \nion of Napoleon's doctor, Larrey, was much \n\n\n\nbeen sewn into this amulet by Mary I/There is more likely to end in death than in convales- \n\n\n\nnothing certain, nothing at all except the un- \nimportance of everything I understand, and \nthe greatness of something incomprehensible \nbut all-importantj \n\nThe stretchers moved on. At every jolt he \nagain felt unendurable pain; his feverishness \n\n\n\ncence. \n\n"He is a nervous, bilious subject," said Lar- \nrey, "and will not recover." \n\nAnd Prince Andrew, with others fatally \nwounded, was left to the care of the inhabit- \nants of the district. \n\n\n\nBook Four: 1806 \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I \n\nEARLY IN THE YEAR 1806 Nicholas Rost6v re- \nturned home on leave. Denisov was going home \nto Vor6nezh and Rost6v persuaded him to \ntravel with him as far as Moscow and to stay \nwith him there. Meeting a comrade at the last \npost station but one before Moscow, Denfsov \nhad drunk three bottles of wine with him \nand, despite the jolting ruts across the snow- \ncovered road, did not once wake up on the way \nto Moscow, but lay at the bottom of the sleigh \nbeside Rost6v, who grew more and more im- \npatient the nearer they got to Moscow. \n\n"How much longer? How much longer? Oh, \nthese insufferable streets, shops, bakers' sign- \nboards, street lamps, and sleighs!" thought \nRost6v, when their leave permits had been \npassed at the town gate and they had entered \nMoscow. \n\n"Denfsov! We're here! He's asleep," he add- \ned, leaning forward with his whole body as if \nin that position he hoped to hasten the speed \nof the sleigh. \n\nDenisov gave no answer. \n\n"There's the corner at the crossroads, where \nthe cabman, Zakhar, has his stand, and there's \nZakhar himself and still the same horse! And \nhere's the little shop where we used to buy gin- \ngerbread! Can't you hurry up? Now then!" \n\n"Which house is it?" asked the driver. \n\n"Why, that one, right at the end, the big \none. Don't you see? That's our house," said \nRost6v. "Of course, it's our house! Denisov, \nDenfsov I We're almost there!" \n\nDenfsov raised his head, coughed, and made \nno answer. \n\n"Dmftri," said Rostov to his valet on the \nbox, "those lights are in our house, aren't \nthey?" \n\n"Yes, sir, and there's a light in your father's \nstudy." \n\n"Then they've not gone to bed yet? What do \nyou think? Mind now, don't forget to put out \nmy new coat," added Rostdv, fingering his new \nmustache. "Now then, get on," he shouted to \n\n\n\nthe driver. "Do wake up, Vdska!" he went on, \nturning to Denfsov, whose head was again nod- \nding. "Come, get on! You shall have three ru- \nbles for vodka get on!" Rost6v shouted, when \nthe sleigh was only three houses from his door. \nIt seemed to him the horses were not moving \nat all. At last the sleigh bore to the right, drew \nup at an entrance, and Rost6v saw overhead \nthe old familiar cornice with a bit of plaster \nbroken off, the porch, and the post by the side \nof the pavement. He sprang out before the \nsleigh stopped, and ran into the hall. The \nhouse stood cold and silent, as if quite regard- \nless of who had come to it. There was no one \nin the hall. "Oh God! Is everyone all right?" \nhe thought, stopping for a moment with a sink- \ning heart, and then immediately starting to \nrun along the hall and up the warped steps of \nthe familiar staircase. The well-known old door \nhandle, which always angered the countess \nwhen it was not properly cleaned, turned as \nloosely as ever. A solitary tallow candle burned \nin the anteroom. \n\nOld Michael was asleep on the chest. Prok6- \nfy, the footman, who was so strong that he \ncould lift the back of the carriage from behind, \nsat plaiting slippers out of cloth selvedges. He \nlooked up at the opening door and his expres- \nsion of sleepy indifference suddenly changed \nto one of delighted amazement. \n\n"Gracious heavens! The young count!" he \ncried, recognizing his young master. "Can it \nbe? My treasure!" and Prok6fy, trembling \nwith excitement, rushed toward the drawing- \nroom door, probably in order to announce \nhim, but, changing his mind, came back and \nstooped to kiss the young man's shoulder. \n\n"All well?" asked Rost6v, drawing away his \narm. \n\n"Yes, God be thanked! Yes! They've just \nfinished supper. Let me have a look at you, \nyour excellency." \n\n"Is everything quite all right?" \n\n"The Lord be thanked, yes!" \n\nRost6v, who had completely forgotten Denf- \n\n\n\n165 \n\n\n\ni66 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nsov, not wishing anyone to forestall him, threw \noff his fur coat and ran on tiptoe through the \nlarge dark ballroom. All was the same: there \nwere the same old card tables and the same \nchandelier with a cover over it; but someone \nhad already seen the young master, and, be- \nfore he had reached the drawing room, some- \nthing flew out from a side door like a tornado \nand began hugging and kissing him. Another \nand yet another creature of the same kind \nsprang from a second door and a third; more \nhugging, more kissing, more outcries, and tears \nof joy. He could not distinguish which was \nPapa, which Natdsha, and which Ptya. Every- \none shouted, talked, and kissed him at the \nsame time. Only his mother was not there, he \nnoticed that. \n\n"And I did not know . . . Nicholas . . . My \ndarling! . . ." \n\n"Here he is ... our own . . . K61ya, a dear fel- \nlow . . . How he has changed! . . . Where are \nthe candles? . . . Tea! . . ." \n\n"And me, kiss me!" \n\n"Dearest . . . and mel" \n\nS6nya, Natdsha, Pdtya, Anna Mikhdylovna, \nVe*ra, and the old count were all hugging him, \nand the serfs, men and maids, flocked into the \nroom, exclaiming and oh-ing and ah-ing. \n\nPe*tya, clinging to his legs, kept shouting, \n"And me too!" \n\nNatdsha, after she had pulled him down to- \nward her and covered his face with kisses, hold- \ning him tight by the skirt of his coat, sprang \naway and pranced up and down in one place \nlike a goat and shrieked piercingly. \n\nAll around were loving eyes glistening with \ntears of joy, and all around were lips seeking a \nkiss. \n\nS6nya too, all rosy red, clung to his arm and, \nradiant with bliss, looked eagerly toward his \neyes, waiting for the look for which she longed. \nS6nya now was sixteen and she was very pretty, \nespecially at this moment of happy, rapturous \nexcitement. She gazed at him, not taking her \neyes off him, and smiling and holding her \nbreath. He gave her a grateful look, but was \nstill expectant and looking for someone. The \nold countess had not yet come. But now steps \nwere heard at the door, steps so rapid that they \ncould hardly be his mother's. \n\nYet it was she, dressed in a new gown which \nhe did not know, made since he had left. All \nthe others let him go, and he ran to her. When \nthey met, she fell on his breast, sobbing. She \ncould not lift her face, but only pressed it to \n\nNicholas. \n\n\n\nthe cold braiding of his hussar's jacket. Denf* \nsov, who had come into the room unnoticed by \nanyone, stood there and wiped his eyes at the \nsight. \n\n"Vasili Denfsov, your son's friend," he said, \nintroducing himself to the count, who was \nlooking inquiringly at him. \n\n"You are most welcome! I know, I know," \nsaid the count, kissing and embracing Denisov. \n"Nicholas wrote us ... Natdsha, Vera, look! \nHere is Denfsovl" \n\nThe same happy, rapturous faces turned to \nthe shaggy figure of Denisov. \n\n"Darling Denfsovl" screamed Natdsha, be- \nside herself with rapture, springing to him, \nputting her arms round him, and kissing him. \nThis escapade made everybody feel confused. \nDenfsov blushed too, but smiled and, taking \nNatdsha's hand, kissed it. \n\nDenfsov was shown to the room prepared \nfor him, and the Rostovs all gathered round \nNicholas in the sitting room. \n\nThe old countess, not letting go of his hand \nand kissing it every moment, sat beside him: \nthe rest, crowding round him, watched every \nmovement, word, or look of his, never taking \ntheir blissfully adoring eyes off him. His broth- \ner and sisters struggled for the places nearest \nto him and disputed with one another who \nshould bring him his tea, handkerchief, and \npipe. \n\nRost6v was very happy in the love they \nshowed him; but the first moment of meeting \nhad been so beatific that his present joy seemed \ninsufficient, and he kept expecting something \nmore, more and yet more. \n\nNext morning, after the fatigues of their \njourney, the travelers slept till ten o'clock. \n\nIn the room next their bedroom there was a \nconfusion of sabers, satchels, sabretaches, open \nportmanteaus, and dirty boots. Two freshly \ncleaned pairs with spurs had just been placed \nby the wall. The servants were bringing in \njugs and basins, hot water for shaving, and \ntheir well-brushed clothes. There was a mascu- \nline odor and a smell of tobacco. \n\n"Hallo, Gwfska my pipe!" came Vasili \nDenfsov's husky voice. "Wost6v, get up!" \n\nRost6v, rubbing his eyes that seemed glued \ntogether, raised his disheveled head from the \nhot pillow. \n\n"Why, is it late?" \n\n"Late! It's nearly ten o'clock," answered Na- \ntdsha's voice. A rustle of starched petticoats \nand the whispering and laughter of girls' voices \ncame from the adjoining room. The door was \n\n\n\nBOOK FOUR \n\n\n\n167 \n\n\n\nopened a crack and there was a glimpse of \nsomething blue, of ribbons, black hair, and \nmerry faces. It was Natasha, S6nya, and Pdtya, \nwho had come to see whether they were get- \nting up. \n\n"Nicholas! Get up!" Natasha's voice was \nagain heard at the door. \n\n"Directly!" \n\nMeanwhile, Pe" tya, having found and seized \nthe sabers in the outer room, with the delight \nboys feel at the sight of a military elder broth- \ner, and forgetting that it was unbecoming for \nthe girls to see men undressed, opened the bed- \nroom door. \n\n"Is this your saber?" he shouted. \n\nThe girls sprang aside. Denfsov hid his hairy \nlegs under the blanket, looking with a scared \nface at his comrade for help. The door, having \nlet Ptya in, closed again. A sound of laughter \ncame from behind it. \n\n"Nicholas! Come outinyourdressinggownl" \nsaid Natasha's voice. \n\n"Is this your saber?" asked Pe*tya. "Or is it \nyours?" he said, addressing the black-mustached \nDenisov with servile deference. \n\nRost6v hurriedly put something on his feet, \ndrew on his dressing gown, and went out. Na- \ntasha had put on one spurred boot and was \njust getting her foot into .the other. S6nya, \nwhen he came in, was twirling round and was \nabout to expand her dresses into a balloon and \nsit down. They were dressed alike, in new pale- \nblue frocks, and were both fresh, rosy, and \nbright. S6nya ran away, but Natdsha, taking \nher brother's arm, led him into the sitting \nroom, where they began talking. They hardly \ngave one another time to ask questions and \ngive replies concerning a thousand little mat- \nters which could not interest anyone but them- \nselves. Natasha laughed at every word he said \nor that she said herself, not because what they \nwere saying was amusing, but because she felt \nhappy and was unable to control her joy which \nexpressed itself by laughter. \n\n"Oh, how nice, how splendid!" she said to \neverything. \n\nRost6v felt that, under the influence of the \nwarm rays of love, that childlike smile which \nhad not once appeared on his face since he left \nhome now for the first time after eighteen \nmonths again brightened his soul and his face. \n\n"No, but listen," she said, "now you are \nquite a man, aren't you? I'm awfully glad you're \nmy brother." She touched his mustache. "I \nwant to know what you men are like. Are you \nthe same as we? No?" \n\n\n\n"Why did S6nya run away?" asked Rost6v. \n\n"Ah, yes! That's a whole long story! How \nare you going to speak to her thou or you?" \n\n"As may happen," said Rost6v. \n\n"No, call her you, please! I'll tell you all \nabout it some other time. No, I'll tell you now. \nYou know S6nya's my dearest friend. Such a \nfriend that I burned my arm for hersake.Look \nhere!" \n\nShe pulled up her muslin sleeve and showed \nhim a red scar on her long; slender, delicate \narm, high above the elbow on that part that is \ncovered even by a ball dress. \n\n"I burned this to prove my love for her. I just \nheated a ruler in the fire and pressed it there!" \n\nSitting on the sofa with the little cushions \non its arms, in what used to be his old school- \nroom, and looking into Natasha's wildly bright \neyes, Rostov re-entered that world of home and \nchildhood which had no meaning for anyone \nelse, but gave him some of the best joys of his \nlife; and the burning of an arm with a ruler as \na proof of love did not seem to him senseless, \nhe understood and was not surprised at it. \n\n"Well, and is that all?" he asked. \n\n"We are such friends, such friends! All that \nruler business was just nonsense, but we are \nfriends forever. She, if she loves anyone, does \nit for life, but I don't understand that, I forget \nquickly." \n\n"Well, what then?" \n\n"Well, she loves me and you like that." \n\nNatiisha suddenly flushed. \n\n"Why, you remember before you went away? \n\n. . . Well, she says you are to forget all that \n\nShe says: 'I shall love him always, but let him \nbe free.' Isn't that lovely and noble! Yes, very \nnoble? Isn't it?" asked Natasha, so seriously \nand excitedly that it was evident that what she \nwas now saying she had talked of before, with \ntears. \n\nRost6v became thoughtful. \n\n"I never go back on my word," he said. "Be- \nsides, S6nya is so charming that only a fool \nwould renounce such happiness." \n\n"No, no!" cried Natasha, "she and I have al- \nready talked it over. We knew you'd s,ay so. \nBut it won't do, because you see, if you say \nthat if you consider yourself bound by your \npromise it will seem as if she had not meant \nit seriously. It makes it as if you were marrying \nher because you must, and that wouldn't do at \nall." \n\nRost6v saw that it had been well considered \nby them. S6nya had already struck him by her \nbeauty on the preceding day. Today, when he \n\n\n\ni68 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nhad caught a glimpse of her, she seemed still \nmore lovely. She was a charming girl of six- \nteen, evidently passionately in love with him \n(he did not doubt that for an instant). Why \nshould he not love her now, and even marry \nher, Rost6v thought, but just now there were \nso many other pleasures and interests before \nhim! "Yes, they have taken a wise decision," he \nthought, "I must remain free." \n\n"Well then, that's excellent," said he. "We'll \ntalk it over later on. Oh, how glad I am to have \nyou! \n\n"Well, and are you still true to Boris?" he \ncontinued. \n\n"Oh, what nonsense!" cried Natdsha, laugh- \ning. "I don't think about him or anyone else, \nand I don't want anything of the kind." \n\n"Dear me I Then what are you up to now?" \n\n"Now?" repeated Natdsha, and a happy smile \nlit up her face. "Have you seen Duport?" \n\n"No." \n\n"Not seen Duport the famous dancer? Well \nthen, you won't understand. That's what I'm \nup to." \n\nCurving her arms, Natdsha held out her \nskirts as dancers do, ran back a few steps, \nturned, cut a caper, brought her little feet \nsharply together, and made some steps on the \nvery tips of her toes. \n\n"See, I'm standing! See!" she said, but could \nnot maintain herself on her toes any longer. \n"So that's what I'm up tol I'll never marry any- \none, but will be a dancer. Only don't tell any- \none." \n\nRost6v laughed so loud and merrily that \nDenisov, in his bedroom, felt envious and Na- \ntdsha could not help joining in. \n\n"No, but don't you think it's nice?" she kept \nrepeating. \n\n"Nice! And so you no longer wish to marry \nBoris?" \n\nNatdsha flared up. "I don't want to marry \nanyone. And I'll tell him so when I see him!" \n\n"Dear me!" said Rost6v. \n\n"But that's all rubbish," Natdsha chattered \non. "And is Denfsov nice?" she asked. \n\n"Yes, indeed!" \n\n"Oh, well then, good-by: go and dress. Is he \nvery terrible, Denisov?" \n\n"Why terrible?" asked Nicholas. "No, Vdska \nis a splendid fellow." \n\n"You call him Vdska? That's funny! And is \nhe very nice?" \n\n"Very." \n\n"Well then, be quick. We'll all have break- \nfast together." \n\n\n\nAnd Natdsha rose and went out of the room \non tiptoe, like a ballet dancer, but smiling as \nonly happy girls of fifteen can smile. When \nRost6v met S6nya in the drawing room, he red- \ndened. He did not know how to behave with \nher. The evening before, in the first happy mo- \nment of meeting, they had kissed each other, \nbut today they felt it could not be done; he felt \nthat everybody, including his mother and sis- \nters, was looking inquiringly at him and watch- \ning to see how he would behave with her. He \nkissed her hand and addressed her not as thou \nbut as you Sdnya. But their eyes met and said \nthou, and exchanged tender kisses. Her looks \nasked him to forgive her for having dared, by \nNatdsha's intermediacy, to remind him of his \npromise, and then thanked him for his love. \nHis looks thanked her for offering him his free- \ndom and told her that one way or another he \nwould never cease to love her, for that would \nbe impossible. \n\n"How strange it is," said Wra, selecting a \nmoment when all were silent, "that S6nya and \nNicholas now say you to one another and meet \nlike strangers." \n\nV^ra's remark was correct, as her remarks al- \nways were, but, like most of her observations, \nit made everyone feel uncomfortable, not only \nS6nya, Nicholas, .and Natdsha, but even the \nold countess, who dreading this love affair \nwhich might hinder Nicholas from making a \nbrilliant match blushed like a girl. \n\nDenfsov, to Rost6v's surprise, appeared in \nthe drawing room with pomaded hair, per- \nfumed, and in a new uniform, looking just as \nsmart as he made himself when going into bat- \ntle, and he was more amiable to the ladies and \ngentlemen than Rost6v had ever expected to \nsee him. \n\nCHAPTER II \n\nON HIS RETURN to Moscow from the army, \nNicholas Rost6v was welcomed by his home cir- \ncle as the best of sons, a hero, and their darling \nNik61enka; by his relations as a charming, at- \ntractive, and polite youngman; by his acquaint- \nances as a handsome lieutenant of hussars, a \ngood dancer, and one of the best matches in \nthe city. \n\nThe Rost6vs knew everybody in Moscow. \nThe old count had money enough that year, \nas all his estates had been remortgaged, and so \nNicholas, acquiring a trotter of his own, very \nstylish riding breeches of the latest cut, such as \nno one else yet had in Moscow, and boots of \nthe latest fashion, with extremely pointed toes \n\n\n\nBOOK FOUR \n\n\n\n169 \n\n\n\nand small silver spurs, passed his time very \ngaily. After a short period of adapting himself \nto the old conditions of life, Nicholas found it \nvery pleasant to be at home again. He felt that \nhe had grown up and matured very much. His \ndespair at failing in a Scripture examination, \nhis borrowing money from Gavrfl to pay a \nsleigh driver, his kissing S6nya on the sly he \nnow recalled all this as childishness he had left \nimmeasurably behind. Now he was a lieuten- \nant of hussars, in a jacket laced with silver, and \nwearing the Cross of St. George, awarded to \nsoldiers for bravery in action, and in the com- \npany of well-known, elderly, and respected rac- \ning men was training a trotter of his own for a \nrace. He knew a lady on one of the boulevards \nwhom he visited of an evening. He led the \nmazurka at the Arkhdrovs' ball, talked about \nthe war with Field Marshal Kdmenski, visited \nthe English Club, and was on intimate terms \nwith a colonel of forty to whom Denisov had \nintroduced him. \n\nHis passion for the Emperor had cooled \nsomewhat in Moscow. But still, as he did not \nsee him and had no opportunity of seeing him, \nhe often spoke about him and about his love \nfor him, letting it be understood that he had \nnot told all and that there was something in \nhis feel ings for the Emperor not everyone could \nunderstand, and with his whole soul he shared \nthe adoration then common in Moscow for the \nEmperor, who was spoken of as the "angel in- \ncarnate." \n\nDuring Rost6v's short stay in Moscow, before \nrejoining the army, he did not draw closer to \nS6nya, but rather drifted away from her. She \nwas very pretty and sweet, and evidently deep- \nly in love with him, but he was at the period of \nyouth when there seems so much to do that \nthere is no time for that sort of thing and a \nyoung man fears to bind himself and prizes \nhis freedom which he needs for so many other \nthings. When he thought of S6nya, during this \nstay in Moscow, he said to himself, "Ah, there \nwill be, and there are, many more such girls \nsomewhere whom I do not yet know. There \nwill be time enough to think about love when \nI want to, but now I have no time." Besides, \nit seemed to him that the society of women was \nrather derogatory to his manhood. He went to \nballs and into ladies' society with an affectation \nof doing so against his will. The races, the \nEnglish Club, sprees with Denisov, and \nvisits to a certain housethat was another \nmatter and quite the thing for a dashing \nyoung hussarl \n\n\n\nAt the beginning of March, old Count \nRost6v was very busy arranging a dinner in \nhonorof Prince Bagrati6n at the English Club. \n\nThe count walked up and down the hall in \nhis dressing gown, giving orders to the club \nsteward and to the famous Feoktfst, the Club's \nhead cook, about asparagus, fresh cucumbers, \nstrawberries, veal, and fish for this dinner. The \ncount had been a member and on the commit- \ntee of the Club from the day it was founded. To \nhim the Club entrusted theaVrangement of the \nfestival in honor of Bagrati6n, for few men \nknew so well how to arrange a feast on an open- \nhanded, hospitable scale, and still fewer men \nwould be so well able and willing to make up \nout of their own resources what might be need- \ned for the success of the fete. The club cook and \nthe steward listened to the count's orders with \npleased faces, for they knew that under no oth- \ner management could they so easily extract a \ngood profit for themselves from a dinner cost- \ning several thousand rubles. \n\n"Well then, mind and have cocks' combs in \nthe turtle soup, you know!" \n\n"Shall we have three cold dishes then?" asked \nthe cook. \n\nThe count considered. \n\n"We can't have lessyes, three . . . the may- \nonnaise, that's one," said he, bending down a \nfinger. \n\n"Then am I to order those large sterlets?" \nasked the steward. \n\n"Yes, it can't be helped if they won't take \nless. Ah, dear me! I was forgetting. We must \nhave another entree. Ah, goodness gracious!" \nhe clutched at his head. "Who is going to get \nme the flowers? Dmftri! Eh, Dmitri 1 Gallop off \nto our Moscow estate," he said to the factotum \nwho appeared at his call. "Hurry off and tell \nMaksim, the gardener, to set the serfs to work. \nSay that everything out of the hothouses must \nbe brought here well wrapped up in felt. I must \nhave two hundred pots here on Friday." \n\nHaving given several more orders, he was \nabout to go to his "little countess" to have a \nrest, but remembering something else of im- \nportance, he returned again, called back the \ncook and the club steward, and again began \ngiving orders. A light footstep and the clinking \nof spurs were heard at the door, and the young \ncount, handsome, rosy, with a dark little mus- \ntache, evidently rested and made sleeker by his \neasy life in Moscow, entered the room. \n\n"Ah, my boy, my head's in a whirl!" said the \nold man with a smile, as if he felt a little con- \nfused before his son, "Now, if you would only \n\n\n\n170 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nhelp a bit! I must have singers too. I shall have \nmy own orchestra, but shouldn't we get the \ngypsy singers as well? You military men like \nthat sort of thing." \n\n"Really, Papa, I believe Prince Bagrati6n \nworried himself less before the battle of Schon \nGrabern than you do now," said his son with \na smile. \n\nThe old count pretended to be angry. \n\n"Yes, you talk, but try it yourself!" \n\nAnd the count turned to the cook, who, with \na shrewd and respectful expression, looked ob- \nservantly and sympathetically at the father and \nson. \n\n"What have the young people come to now- \nadays, eh, Feoktist?" said he. "Laughing at us \nold fellows!" \n\n"That's so, your excellency, all they have to \ndo is to eat a good dinner, but providing it and \nserving it all up, that's not their business!" \n\n"That's it, that's it!" exclaimed the count, \nand gaily seizing his son by both hands, he \ncried, "Now I've got you, so take the sleigh \nand pair at once, and go to Bezukhob's, and \ntell him 'Count Ilyd has sent you to ask for \nstrawberries and fresh pineapples.' We can't \nget them from anyone else. He's not there him- \nself, so you'll have to go in and ask the prin- \ncesses; and from there go on to the Rasgulyay \nthe coachman Ipdtka knows and look up \nthe gypsy Ilyushka, the one who danced at \nCount Orl6v's, you remember, in a white Cos- \nsack coat, and bring him along to me." \n\n"And am I to bring the gypsy girls along \nwith him?" asked Nicholas, laughing. "Dear, \ndear! . . ." \n\nAt that moment, with noiseless footsteps and \nwith the businesslike, preoccupied, yet meekly \nChristian look which never left her face, Anna \nMikMylovna entered the hall. Though she \ncame upon thecount in his dressing gown every \nday, he invariably became confused and \nbegged her to excuse his costume. \n\n"No matter at all, my dear count," she said, \nmeekly closing her eyes. "But I'll go to Bezuk- \nhov's myself. Pierre has arrived, and now we \nshall get anything we want from his hothouses. \nI have to see him in any case. He has forward- \ned me a letter from Boris. Thank God, Boris \nis now on the staff." \n\nThe count was delighted at Anna Mikhay- \nlovna's taking upon herself one of his com- \nmissions and ordered the small closed carriage \nfor her. \n\n"Tell Bezukhov to come. I'll put his name \ndown. Is bis wife with him?" he asked. \n\n\n\nAnna Mikhdylovna turned up her eyes, and \nprofound sadness was depicted on her face. \n\n"Ah, my dear friend, he is very unfortunate," \nshe said. "If what we hear is true, it is dreadful. \nHow little we dreamed of such a thing when \nwe were rejoicing at his happiness! And such \na lofty angelic soul as young Bezukhovl Yes, I \npity him from my heart, and shall try to give \nhim what consolation I can." \n\n"Wh-what is the matter?" asked both the \nyoung and old Rostov. \n\nAnna Mikhdylovna sighed deeply. \n\n"D61okhov, Mary Ivdnovna's son," she said \nin a mysterious whisper, "has compromised her \ncompletely, they say. Pierre took him up, in- \nvited him to his house in Petersburg, and now \n... she has come here and that daredevil after \nher!" said Anna Mikhylovna, wishing to show \nher sympathy for Pierre, but by involuntary \nintonations and a half smile betraying her \nsympathy for the "daredevil," as she called \nDdlokhov. "They say Pierre is quite broken by \nhis misfortune." \n\n"Dear, dear! But still tell him to come to the \nClub it will all blow over. It will be a tre- \nmendous banquet." \n\nNext day, the third of March, soon after one \no'clock, two hundred and fifty members of the \nEnglish Cluband fifty guests were awaiting the \nguest of honor and hero of the Austrian cam- \npaign, Prince Bagrati6n, to dinner. \n\nOn the first arrival of the news of the battle \nof Austerlitz, Moscow had been bewildered. At \nthat time, the Russians were so used to victories \nthat on receiving news of the defeat some \nwould simply not believe it, while others sought \nsome extraordinary explanation of so strange \nan event. In the English Club, where all who \nwere distinguished, important, and well in- \nformed forgathered when the news began to \narrive in December, nothing was said about the \nwar and the last battle, as though all were in a \nconspiracy of silence. The men who set the tone \nin conversation Count Rostopchin, Prince \nYuri Dolgortikov, Valiiev, Count Mdrkov, and \nPrince Vyazemski did not show themselves at \nthe Club, but met in private houses in inti- \nmate circles, and the Moscovites who took \ntheir opinions from others Ilya Rost6v among \nthem remained for a while without any defi- \nnite opinion on the subject of the war and \nwithout leaders. The Moscovites felt that some- \nthing was wrong and that to discuss the bad \nnews was difficult, and so it was best to be si- \nlent. But after a while, just as a jury comes out \nof its room, the bigwigs who guided the Club's \n\n\n\nBOOK FOUR \n\n\n\n171 \n\n\n\nopinion reappeared, and everybody began \nspeaking clearly and definitely. Reasons were \nfound for the incredible! unheard-of, and im- \npossible event of a Russian defeat, everything \nbecame clear, and in all corners of Moscow \nthe same things began to be said. These reasons \nwere the treachery of the Austrians, a defective \ncommissariat, the treachery of the Pole Przeby- \nszwski and of the Frenchman Langeron, Ku- \ntuzov's incapacity, and (it was whispered) the \nyouth and inexperience of the sovereign, who \nhad trusted worthless and insignificant people. \nBut the army, the Russian army, everyone de- \nclared, was extraordinary and had achieved \nmiracles of valor. The soldiers, officers, and gen- \nerals were heroes. But the hero of heroes was \nPrince Bagrati6n, distinguished by his Schon \nGrabern affair and by the retreat from Auster- \nlitz, where he alone had withdrawn his col- \numn unbroken and had all day beaten back an \nenemy force twice as numerous as his own. \nWhat also conduced to Bagrati6n's being se- \nlected as Moscow's hero was the fact that he \nhad no connections in the city and was a stran- \nger there. In his person, honor was shown to a \nsimple fighting Russian soldier without con- \nnections and intrigues, and to one who was as- \nsociated by memories of the Italian campaign \nwith the name of Suv6rov. Moreover, paying \nsuch honor to Bagrati6n was the best way of \nexpressing disapproval and dislike of Kutiizov. \n\n"Had there been no Bagrati6n, it would \nhave been necessary to invent him," said the \nwit Shinshfn, parodying the words of Voltaire. \nKutiizov no one spoke of, except some who \nabused him in whispers, calling him a court \nweathercock and an old satyr. \n\nAll Moscow repeated Prince Dolgonikov's \nsaying: "If you go on modeling and model- \ning you must get smeared with clay," suggest- \ning consolation for our defeat by the memory \nof former victories; and the words of Rostop- \nchfn, that French soldiers have to be incited to \nbattle by highfalutin words, and Germans by \nlogical arguments to show them that it is more \ndangerous to run away than to advance, but \nthat Russian soldiers only need to be restrained \nand held back! On all sides, new and fresh an- \necdotes were heard of individual examples of \nheroism shown by our officers and men at Aus- \nterlitz. One had saved a standard, another had \nkilled five Frenchmen, a third had loaded five \ncannon singlehanded. Berg was mentioned, by \nthose who did not know him, as having, when \nwounded in the right hand, taken his sword in \nthe left, and gone forward. Of Bolk6nski, noth- \n\n\n\ning was said, and only those who knew him in- \ntimately regretted that he had died so young, \nleaving a pregnant wife with his eccentric \nfather. \n\nCHAPTER III \n\nON THAT third of March, all the rooms in the \nEnglish Club were filled with a hum of conver- \nsation, like the hum of beesswarming in spring- \ntime. The members and guests of the Club \nwandered hither and thither, sat, stood, met, \nand separated, some in uniform and some in \nevening dress, and a few here and there with \npowdered hair and in Russian kaftdns. Pow- \ndered footmen, in livery with buckled shoes \nand smart stockings, stood at every door anx- \niously noting visitors' every movement in order \nto offer their services. Most of those present \nwere elderly, respected men with broad, self- \nconfident faces, fat fingers, and resolute ges- \ntures and voices. This class of guests and mem- \nbers sat in certain habitual places and met in \ncertain habitual groups. A minority of those \npresent were casual guests chiefly young men, \namong whom were Denfsov, Rostov, and D6- \nlokhov who was now again an officer in the \nSemenov regiment. The faces of these young \npeople, especially those who were militarymen, \nbore that expression of condescending respect \nfor their elders which seems to say to the older \ngeneration, "We are prepared to respect and \nhonor you, but all the same remember that the \nfuture belongs to us." \n\nNesvf tski was there as an old member of the \nClub. Pierre, who at his wife's command had \nlet his hair grow and abandoned his spectacles, \nwent about the rooms fashionably dressed but \nlooking sad and dull. Here, as elsewhere, he \nwas surrounded by an atmosphere of subser- \nvience to his wealth, and being in the habit of \nlording it over these people, he treated them \nwith absent-minded contempt. \n\nBy his age he should have belonged to the \nyounger men, but by his wealth and connec- \ntions he belonged to the groups of old and hon- \nored guests, and so he went from one group to \nanother. Some of the most important old men \nwere the center of groups which even strangers \napproached respectfully to hear the voices of \nwell-known men. The largest circles formed \nround Count Rostopchfn, Valtiev, and Nary- \nshkin. Rostopchfn was describing how the Rus- \nsians had been overwhelmed by flying Austri- \nans and had had to force their way through \nthem with bayonets. \n\nValiiev was confidentially telling that Uvdrov \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nhad been sent from Petersburg to ascertain \nwhat Moscow was thinking about Austerlitz. \n\nIn the third circle, Naryshkin was speaking \nof the meeting of the Austrian Council of War \nat which Suv6rov crowed like a cock in reply to \nthe nonsense talked by the Austrian generals. \nShinshfn, standing close by, tried to make a \njoke, saying that Kutuzov had evidently failed \nto learn from Suv6roveven so simple a thing as \nthe art of crowing like a cock, but the elder \nmembers glanced severely at the wit, making \nhim feel that in that place and on that day, it \nwas improper to speak so of Kutuzov. \n\nCount Ilyd Rost6v, hurried and preoccupied, \nwent about in his soft boots between the din- \ning and drawing rooms, hastily greeting the \nimportant and unimportant, all of whom he \nknew, as if they were all equals, while his eyes \noccasionally sought out his fine well-set-up \nyoung son, resting on him and winking joyful- \nly at him. Young Rost6v stood at a window \nwith Dolokhov, whose acquaintance he had \nlately made and highly valued. The old count \ncame up to them and pressed D61okhov's hand. \n\n"Please come and visit us ... you know my \nbrave boy . . . been together out there . . . both \nplaying the hero . . . Ah, Vasfli Igndtovich . . . \nHow d'ye do, old fellow?" he said, turning to \nan old man who was passing, but before he had \nfinished his greeting there was a general stir, \nand a footman who had run in announced, \nwith a frightened face: "He's arrived!" \n\nBells rang, the stewards rushed forward, and \nlike rye shaken together in a shovelthe \nguests who had been scattered about in differ- \nent rooms came together and crowded in the \nlarge drawing room by the door of the ball- \nroom. \n\nBagrati6n appeared in the doorway of the \nanteroom without hat or sword, which, in ac- \ncord with the Club custom, he had given up to \nthe hall porter. He had no lambskin cap on his \nhead, nor had he a loaded whip over his shoul- \nder, as when Rost6v had seen him on the eve \nof the battle of Austerlitz, but wore a tight new \nuniform with Russian and foreign Orders, and \nthe Star of St. George on his left breast. Evi- \ndently just before coming to the dinner he had \nhad his hair and whiskers trimmed, which \nchanged his appearance for the worse. There \nwas something naively festive in his air, which, \nin con junction with his firm and virile features, \ngave him a rather comical expression. Bekle- \nshe*v and Theodore Uvdrov, who had arrived \nwith him, paused at the doorway to allow him, \nas the guest of honor, to enter first. Bagrati6n \n\n\n\nwas embarrassed, not wishing to avail himself \nof their courtesy, and this caused some delay \nat the doors, but after all he did at last enter \nfirst. He walked shyly and awkwardly over the \nparquet floor of the reception room, not know- \ning what to do with his hands; he was more ac- \ncustomed to walk over a plowed field under \nfire, as he had done at the head of the Kursk \nregiment at Schon Grabern and he would \nhave found that easier. The committeemen met \nhim at the first door and, expressing their de- \nlight at seeing such a highly honored guest, \ntook possession of him as it were, without wait- \ning for his reply, surrounded him, and led \nhim to the drawing room. It was at first impos- \nsible to enter the drawing-room door for the \ncrowd of members and guests jostling one an- \nother and trying to get a good look at Bagrati6n \nover each other's shoulders, as if he were some \nrare animal. Count Ilyd Rost6v, laughing and \nrepeating the words, "Make way, dear boy! \nMake way, make way!" pushed through the \ncrowd more energetically than anyone, led the \nguests into the drawing room, and seated them \non the center sofa. The bigwigs, the most re- \nspected members of the Club, beset the new ar- \nrivals. Count Ilya, again thrusting his way \nthrough the crowd, went out of the drawing \nroom and reappeared a minute later with an- \nother committeeman, carrying a large silver sal- \nver which hepresented to Prince Bagrati6n.On \nthe salver lay some verses composed and print- \ned in the hero's honor. Bagrati6n, on seeing the \nsalver,glanced around in dismay, as though seek- \ning help. But all eyes demanded that he should \nsubmit. Feeling himself in their power, he res- \nolutely took the salver with both hands and \nlooked sternly and reproachfully at the count \nwho had presented it to him. Someone oblig- \ningly took the dish from Bagrati6n (or he \nwould, it seemed, have held it till evening and \nhave gone in to dinner with it) and drew his \nattention to the verses. \n\n"Well, I will read them, then!" Bagrati6n \nseemed to say, and, fixing his weary eyes on the \npaper, began to read them with a fixed and \nserious expression. But the author himself took \nthe verses and began reading them aloud. Ba- \ngrati6n bowed his head and listened: \n\nBring glory then to Alexander's reign \n\nAnd on the throne our Titus shield. \n\nA dreaded foe be thou, kindhearted as a man, \n\nA Rhipheus at home, a Caesar in the field! \n\nE'en fortunate Napoleon \n\nKnows by experience f now, Bagratidn, \n\nAnd dare not Herculean Russians trouble. . . . \n\n\n\nBOOK FOUR \n\nBut before he had finished reading, a stentori- \nan major-domo announced that dinner was \nready! The door opened, and from the din- \ning room came the resounding strains of the \npolonaise: \n\n\n\n173 \n\n\n\nConquest's joyful thunder waken, \nTriumph, valiant Russians, now! . . . \n\nand Count Rost6v, glancing angrily at the au- \nthor who went on reading his verses, bowed to \nBagrati6n. Everyone rose, feeling that dinner \nwas more important than verses, and Bagrati6n, \nagain preceding all the rest, went in to dinner. \nHe was seated in the place of honor between \ntwo Alexanders Bekleshev and Naryshkin \nwhich was a significant allusion to the name of \nthe sovereign. Three hundred persons took \ntheir seats in the dining room, according to \ntheir rank and importance: the more impor- \ntant nearer to the honored guest, as naturally \nas water flows deepest where the land lies low- \nest. \n\nJust before dinner, Count Ilya Rost6v pre- \nsented his son to Bagrati6n, who recognized \nhim and said a few words to him, disjointed \nand awkward, as were all the words he spoke \nthat day, and Count Ilya looked joyfully and \nproudly around while Bagrati6n spoke to his \nson. \n\nNicholas Rost6v, with Denisov and his new \nacquaintance, D61okhov, sat almost at the mid- \ndle of the table. Facing them sat Pierre, beside \nPrince Nesvitski. Count Ilya Rost6v with the \nother members of the committee sat facing Ba- \ngrati6n and, as the very personification of \nMoscow hospitality, did the honors to the \nprince. \n\nHis efforts had not been in vain. The dinner, \nboth the Lenten and the other fare, was splen- \ndid, yet he could not feel quite at ease till the \nend of the meal. He winked at the butler, whis- \npered directions to the footmen, and awaited \neach expected dish with some anxiety. Every- \nthing was excellent. With the second course, a \ngigantic sterlet (at sight of which Ilya Rost6v \nblushed with self-conscious pleasure), the foot- \nmen began popping corks and filling the cham- \npagne glasses. After the fish, which made a cer- \ntain sensation, the count exchanged glances \nwith the other committeemen. "There will be \nmany toasts, it's time to begin," he whispered, \nand taking up his glass, he rose. All were silent, \nwaiting for what he would say. \n\n"To the health of our Sovereign, the Em- \nperor!" he cried, and at the same moment his \nkindly eyes grew moist with tears of joy and \n\n\n\nenthusiasm. The band immediately struck up \n"Conquest's joyful thunder waken . . ." All \nrose and cried "Hurrah!" Bagrati6n also rose \nand shouted "Hurrah!" in exactly the same \nvoice in which he had shouted it on the field \nat Schon Grabern. Young Rost6v's ecstatic \nvoice could be heard above the three hundred \nothers. He nearly wept. "To the health of our \nSovereign , the Emperor ! " he roared, ' 'Hurrah ! ' ' \nand emptying his glass at one gulp he dashed \nit to the floor. Many followed his example, and \nthe loud shouting continued for a long time. \nWhen the voices subsided, the footmen cleared \naway the broken glass and everybody sat down \nagain, smiling at the noise they had made and \nexchanging remarks. The old count rose once \nmore, glanced at a note lying beside his plate, \nand proposed a toast, "To the health of the \nhero of our last campaign, Prince Peter Ivano- \nvich Bagrati6nl" and again his blue eyes grew \nmoist. "Hurrah!" cried the three hundred \nvoices again, but instead of the band a choir \nbegan singing a cantata composed by Paul \nIvanovich Kutuzov: \n\nRussians! O'er all barriers on! \n\nCourage conquest guarantees; \n\nHave we not Bagratidnf \n\nHe brings foemen to their knees, . . . etc. \n\nAs soon as the singing was over, another and \nanother toast was proposed and Count Ilyd \nRost6v became more and more moved, more \nglass was smashed, and the shouting grew loud- \ner. They drank to Bekleshev, Naryshkin, Uv- \nrov, Dolgoriikov, Aprdksin, Valiiev, to thecom- \nmittee, to all the Club members and to all the \nClub guests, and finally to Count Ilya Rost6v \nseparately, as the organizer of the banquet. At \nthat toast, the count took out his handkerchief \nand, covering his face, wept outright. \n\nCHAPTER IV \n\nPIERRE SAT OPPOSITE D61okhov and Nicholas \nRost6v. As usual, he ate and drank much, and \neagerly. But those who knew him intimately \nnoticed that some great change had come over \nhim that day. He was silent all through dinner \nand looked about, blinking and scowling, or, \nwith fixed eyes and a look of complete absent- \nmindedness, kept rubbing the bridge of his \nnose. His face was depressed and gloomy. He \nseemed to see and hear nothing of what was \ngoing on around him and to be absorbed by \nsome depressing and unsolved problem. \n\nThe unsolved problem that tormented him \nwas caused by hints given by the princess, his \ncousin, at Moscow, concerning D61okhov's \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nintimacy with his wife, and by an anonymous \nletter he had received that morning, which in \nthe mean jocular way common to anonymous \nletters said that he saw badly through his spec- \ntacles, but that his wife's connection with D61- \nokhov was a secret to no one but himself. \nPierre absolutely disbelieved both the princess* \nhints and the letter, but he feared now to look \nat D61okhov, who was sitting opposite him. \nEvery time he chanced to meet Drilokhov's \nhandsome insolent eyes, Pierre felt something \nterrible and monstrous rising in his soul and \nturned quickly away. Involuntarily recalling \nhis wife's past and her relations with D61okhov, \nPierre saw clearly that what was said in the let- \nter might be true, or might at least seem to be \ntrue had it not referred to his wife. He invol- \nuntarily remembered how D61okhov, who had \nfully recovered his former position after the \ncampaign, had returned to Petersburg and \ncome to him. Availing himself of his friendly \nrelations with Pierre as a boon companion, \nD6Iokhov had come straight to his house, and \nPierre had put him up and lent him money. Pi- \nerre recalled how Hlne had smilingly ex- \npressed disapproval of D61okhov's living at \ntheir house, and how cynically Dolokhov had \npraised his wife's beauty to him and from that \ntime till they came to Moscow had not left \nthem for a day. \n\n"Yes, he is very handsome," thought Pierre, \n"and I know him. It would be particularly \npleasant to him to dishonor my name and rid- \nicule me, just because I have exerted myself on \nhis behalf, befriended him, and helped him. I \nknow and understand what a spice that would \nadd to the pleasure of deceiving me, if it real- \nly were true. Yes, if it were true, but I do not \nbelieve it. I have no right to, and can't, believe \nit." He remembered the expression Dolokhov's \nface assumed in his moments of cruelty, as \nwhen tying the policeman to the bear and \ndropping them into the water, or when he chal- \nlenged a man to a duel without any reason, or \nshot a post-boy's horse with a pistol. That ex- \npression was often on D61okhov's face when \nlooking at him. "Yes, he is a bully," thought \nPierre, "to kill a man means nothing to him. \nIt must seem to him that everyone is afraid of \nhim, and that must please him. He must think \nthat I, too, am afraid of him and in fact I am \nafraid of him/' he thought, and again he felt \nsomething terrible and monstrous rising in his \nsoul. D61okhov, Denisov, and Rost6vwere now \nsitting opposite Pierre and seemed very gay. \nRost6v was talking merrily to his two friends, \n\n\n\none of whom was a dashing hussar and the oth- \ner a notorious duelist and rake, and every now \nand then he glanced ironically at Pierre, whose \npreoccupied, absent-minded, and massive fig- \nure was a very noticeable one at the dinner. \nRost6v looked inimically at Pierre, first be- \ncause Pierre appeared to his hussar eyes as a \nrich civilian, the husband of a beauty, and in \na word an old woman; and secondly because \nPierre in his preoccupation and absent-mind- \nedness had not recognized Rostov and had not \nresponded to his greeting. When the Emperor's \nhealth was drunk, Pierre, lost in thought, did \nnot rise or lift his glass. \n\n"What are you about?" shouted Rost6v, look- \ning at him in an ecstacyof exasperation. "Don't \nyou hear it's His Majesty the Emperor's health?" \n\nPierre sighed, rose submissively, emptied his \nglass, and, waiting till all were seated again, \nturned with his kindly smile to Rostov. \n\n"Why, I didn't recognize you!" he said. But \nRost6v was otherwise engaged; he was shout- \ning "Hurrah!" \n\n"Why don't you renew the acquaintance?" \nsaid D61okhov to Rost6v. \n\n"Confound him, he's a fool!" said Rost6v. \n\n"One should make up to the husbands of \npretty women," said Denisov. \n\nPierre did not catch what they were saying, \nbut knew they were talking about him. He red- \ndened and turned away. \n\n"Well, now to the health of handsome wom- \nen!" said D61okhov, and with a serious expres- \nsion, but with a smile lurking at the corners of \nhis mouth, he turned with his glass to Pierre. \n\n"Here's to the health of lovely women, Pe- \ntcrkin and their lovers!" he added. \n\nPierre, with downcast eyes, drank out of his \nglass without looking at D61okhov or answer- \ning him. The footman, who was distributing \nleaflets with Kutuzov's cantata, laid one before \nPierre as one of the principal guests. He was \njust going to take it when D61okhov, leaning \nacross, snatched it from his hand and began \nreading it. Pierre looked at D61okhov and his \neyes dropped, the something terrible and mon- \nstrous that had tormented him all dinnertime \nrose and took possession of him. He leaned his \nwhole massive body across the table. \n\n"How dare you take it?" he shouted. \n\nHearing that cry and seeing to whom it was \naddressed, Nesvitski and the neighbor on his \nright quickly turned in alarm to Bezukhov. \n\n"Don't! Don't! What are you about?" whis- \npered their frightened voices. \n\nD61okhov looked at Pierre with clear, mirth- \n\n\n\nBOOK FOUR \n\n\n\nful, cruel eyes, and that smile of his which \nseemed to say, "Ah! This is what I like!" \n\n"You shan't have it!" he said distinctly. \n\nPale, with quivering lips, Pierre snatched the \ncopy. \n\n"You . . . ! you . . . scoundrel! I challenge \nyou!" he ejaculated, and, pushing back his \nchair, he rose from the table. \n\nAt the very instant he did this and uttered \nthose words, Pierre felt that the question of his \nwife's guilt which had been tormenting him the \nwhole day was finally and indubitably answered \nin the affirmative. He hated her and was for- \never sundered from her. Despite Denisov's re- \nquest that he would take no part in the matter, \nRost6v agreed to be Dolokhov's second, and \nafter dinner he discussed the arrangements for \nthe duel with Nesvitski, Beziikhov's second. \nPierre went home, but Rost6v with Dolokhov \nand Denfsov stayed on at the Club till late, \nlistening to the gypsies and other singers. \n\n"Well then, till tomorrow at Sok61niki,"said \nD61okhov, as he took leave of Rostov in the \nClub porch. \n\n"And do you feel quite calm?" Rost6v asked. \n\nD61okhov paused. \n\n"Well, you see, I'll tell you the whole secret \nof dueling in two words. If you are going to \nfight a duel, and you make a will and write af- \nfectionate letters to your parents, and if you \nthink you may be killed, you are a fool and are \nlost for certain. But go with the firm intention \nof killing your man as quickly and surely as \npossible, and then all will be right, as our bear \nhuntsman at Kostromd used to tell me. 'Every- \none fears a bear/ he says, 'but when you see one \nyour fear's all gone, and your only thought is \nnot to let^him get away!' And that's how it is \nwith me. A demain, mon cher" * \n\nNext day, at eight in the morning, Pierre \nand Nesvftski drove to the Sok61niki forest and \nfound D61okhov, Denfsov, and Rost6v already \nthere. Pierre had the air of a man preoccupied \nwith considerations which had no connection \nwith the matter in hand. His haggard face was \nyellow. He had evidently not slept that night. \nHe looked about distractedly and screwed up \nhis eyes as if dazzled by the sun. He was entirely \nabsorbed by two considerations: his wife's \nguilt, of which after his sleepless night he had \nnot the slightest doubt, and the guiltlessness of \nD61okhov, who had no reason to preserve the \n\nhonor of a man who was nothing to him "I \n\nshould perhaps have done the same thing in his \nplace," thought Pierre. "It's even certain that \n\n1 Till tomorrow, my dear fellow. \n\n\n\nI should have done the same, then why this \nduel, this murder? Either I shall kill him, or he \nwill hit me in the head, or elbow, or knee. Can't \nI go away from here, run away, bury myself \nsomewhere?" passed through his mind. But just \nat moments when such thoughts occurred to \nhim, he would ask in a particularly calm and \nabsent-minded way, which inspired the respect \nof the onlookers, "Will it be long? Are things \nready?" \n\nWhen all was ready, the sabers stuck in the \nsnow to mark the barriers, and the pistols load- \ned, Nesvitski went up to Pierre. \n\n"I should not be doing my duty, Count," he \nsaid in timid tones, "and should not justify \nyour confidence and the honor you have done \nme in choosing me for your second, if at this \ngrave, this very grave, moment I did not tell \nyou the whole truth. I think there is no suffi- \ncient ground for this affair, or for blood to be \nshed over it. ... You were not right, not quite \nin the right, you were impetuous . . ." \n\n"Oh yes, it is horribly stupid," said Pierre. \n\n"Then allow me to express your regrets, and \nI am sure your opponent will accept them," \nsaid Nesvftski (who like the others concerned \nin the affair, and like everyone in similar cases, \ndid not yet believe that the affair had come to \nan actual duel). "You know, Count, it is much \nmore honorable to admit one's mistake than to \nlet matters become irreparable. There was no \ninsult on either side. Allow me to convey . . ." \n\n"No! What is there to talk about?" said Pi- \nerre. "It'sall the same Is every thing ready?" \n\nhe added. "Only tell me where to go and where \nto shoot," he said with an unnaturally gentle \nsmile. \n\nHe took the pistol in his hand and began ask- \ning about the working of the trigger, as he had \nnot before held a pistol in his hand a fact \nthat he did not wish to confess. \n\n"Oh yes, like that, I know, I only forgot," \nsaid he. \n\n"No apologies, none whatever," said D61o- \nkhov to Denfsov (who on his side had been at- \ntempting a reconciliation), and he also went \nup to the appointed place. \n\nThe spot chosen for the duel was some eighty \npaces from the road, where the sleighs had \nbeen left, in a small clearing in the pine forest \ncovered with melting snow, the frost having \nbegun to break up during the last few days. \nThe antagonists stood forty paces apart at the \nfarther edge of the clearing. The seconds, meas- \nuring the paces, left tracks in the deep wet \nsnow between the place where they had been \n\n\n\n176 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nstandingand Nesvftski'sand D61okhov's sabers, \nwhich were stuck into the ground ten paces \napart to mark the barrier. It was thawing and \nmisty; at forty paces' distance nothing could \nbe seen. For three minutes all had been ready, \nbut they still delayed and all were silent. \n\nCHAPTER V \n"WELL, BEGIN!" said D61okhov. \n\n"All right," said Pierre, still smiling in the \nsame way. A feeling of dread was in the air. It \nwas evident that the affair so lightly begun \ncould no longer be averted but was taking its \ncourse independently of men's will. \n\nDenisov first went to the barrier and an- \nnounced: "As the adve'sawies have wefused a \nweconciliation, please pwoceed.Take your pis- \ntols, and at the word thwee begin to advance. \n\n"O-ne! T-wol Thwee!" he shouted angrily \nand stepped aside. \n\nThe combatants advanced along the trodden \ntracks, nearer and nearer to one another, be- \nginning to see one another through the mist. \nThey had the right to fire when they liked as \nthey approached the barrier. D61okhov walked \nslowly without raising his pistol, looking in- \ntently with his bright, sparkling blue eyes into \nhis antagonist's face. His mouth wore its usual \nsemblance of a smile. \n\n"So I can fire when I like!" said Pierre, and \nat the word "three," he went quickly forward, \nmissing the trodden path and stepping into the \ndeep snow. He held the pistol in his right hand \nat arm's length, apparently afraid of shooting \nhimself with it. His left hand he held careful- \nly back, because he wished to support his right \nhand with it and knew he must not do so. Hav- \ning advanced six paces and strayed off the track \ninto the snow, Pierre looked down at his feet, \nthen quickly glanced at D61okhov and, bend- \ning his finger as he had been shown, fired. Not \nat all expecting so loud a report, Pierre shud- \ndered at the sound and then, smiling at his own \nsensations, stood still. The smoke, rendered \ndenser by the mist, prevented him from seeing \nanything for an instant, but there was no second \nreport as he had expected. He only heard D6- \nlokhov's hurried steps, and his figure came in \nview through the smoke. He was pressing one \nhand to his left side, while the other clutched \nhis drooping pistol. His face was pale. Rost6v \nran toward him and said something. \n\n"No-o-o!" muttered D61okhov through his \nteeth, "no, it's not over." And after stumbling \na few staggering steps right up to the saber, he \nsank on the snow beside it. His left hand was \n\n\n\nbloody; he wiped it on his coat and supported \nhimself with it. His frowning face was pallid \nand quivered. \n\n"Plea ..." began D61okhov, but could not at \nfirst pronounce the word. \n\n"Please," he uttered with an effort. \n\nPierre, hardly restraining his sobs, began \nrunning toward D61okhov and was about to \ncross the space between the barriers, when D6- \nlokhov cried: \n\n"To your barrier! "and Pierre, grasping what \nwas meant, stopped by his saber. Only ten paces \ndivided them. D61okhov lowered his head to \nthe snow, greedily bit at it, again raised his \nhead, adjusted himself, drew in his legs and sat \nup, seeking a firm center of gravity. He sucked \nand swallowed the cold snow, his lips quivered, \nbut his eyes, still smiling, glittered with effort \nand exasperation as he mustered his remaining \nstrength. He raised his pistol and aimed. \n\n"Sideways! Cover yourself with your pistol!" \nejaculated Nesvitski. \n\n"Cover yourself!" even Denisov cried to his \nadversary. \n\nPierre, with a gentle smile of pity and re- \nmorse, his arms and legs helplessly spread out, \nstood with his broad chest directly facing D6- \nlokhovand looked sorrowfully at him. Dcnfsov, \nRostov, and Nesvitski closed their eyes. At the \nsame instant they heard a report and Dolo- \nkhov's angry cry. \n\n"Missed!" shouted Dolokhov, and he lay \nhelplessly, face downwards on the snow. \n\nPierre clutched his temples, and turning \nround went into the forest, trampling through \nthe deep snow, and muttering incoherent \nwords: \n\n"Folly . . . folly! Death . . . lies . . ." he re- \npeated, puckering his face. \n\nNesvf tski stopped him and took him home. \n\nRost6v and Denisov drove away with the \nwounded D61okhov. \n\nThe latter lay silent in the sleigh with closed \neyes and did not answer a word to the ques- \ntions addressed to him. But on entering Mos- \ncow he suddenly came to and, lifting his head \nwith an effort, took Rost6v, who was sitting be- \nside him, by the hand. Rost6v was struck by the \ntotally altered and unexpectedly rapturous \nand tender expression on Ddlokhov's face. \n\n"Well? How do you feel?" he asked. \n\n"Bad! But it's not that, my friend "said D61- \nokhov with a gasping voice. "Where are we? In \nMoscow, I know. I don't matter, but I have \nkilled her, killed . . . She won't get over it! She \nwon't survive. . . ." \n\n\n\nBOOK FOUR \n\n\n\n177 \n\n\n\n"Who?" asked Rost6v. \n\n"My mother! My mother, my angel, my \nadored angel mother," and D61okhov pressed \nRostov's hand and burst into tears. \n\nWhen he had become a little quieter, he ex- \nplained to Rost6v that he was living with his \nmother, who, if she saw him dying, would not \nsurvive it. He implored Rost6v to go on and \nprepare her. \n\nRost6v went on ahead to do what was asked, \nand to his great surprise learned that D61okhov \nthe brawler, D61okhov the bully, lived in Mos- \ncow with an old mother and a hunchback sis- \nter, and was the most affectionate of sons and \nbrothers. \n\nCHAPTER VI \n\nPIERRE HAD of late rarely seen his wife alone. \nBoth in Petersburg and in Moscow their house \nwas always full of visitors. The night after the \nduel he did not go to his bedroom but, as he \noften did, remained in his father's room, that \nhuge room in which Count Bezukhovhad died. \n\nHe lay down on the sofa meaning to fall \nasleep and forget all that had happened to him, \nbut could not do so. Such a storm of feelings, \nthoughts, and memories suddenly arose within \nhim that he could not fall asleep, nor even re- \nmain in one place, but had to jump up and \npace the room with rapid steps. Now he seemed \nto see her in the early days of their marriage, \nwith bare shoulders and a languid, passionate \nlook on her face, and then immediately he saw \nbeside her D61okhov's handsome, insolent, \nhard, and mocking face as he had seen it at the \nbanquet, and then that same face pale, quiver- \ning, and suffering, as it had been when he reeled \nand sank on the snow. \n\n"What has happened?" he asked himself. "I \nhave killed her lover, yes, killed my wife's lover. \nYes, that was it! And why? How did I come to \ndo it?" "Because you married her," answered \nan inner voice. \n\n"But in what was I to blame?" he asked. "In \nmarrying her without loving her; in deceiving \nyourself and her." And he vividly recalled that \nmoment after supper at Prince Vasili's, when \nhe spoke those words he had found so difficult \nto utter: "I love you." "It all comes from that! \nEven then I felt it," he thought. "I felt then \nthat it was not so, that I had no right to do it. \nAnd so it turns out." \n\nHe remembered his honeymoon and blushed \nat the recollection. Particularly vivid, humili- \nating, and shameful was the recollection of \nhow one day soon after his marriage he came \n\n\n\nout of the bedroom into his study a little be- \nfore noon in his silk dressing gown and found \nhis head steward there, who, bowing respect- \nfully, looked into his face and at his dressing \ngown and smiled slightly, as if expressing re- \nspectful understanding of his employer's hap- \npiness. \n\n"But how often I have felt proud of her, \nproud of her majestic beauty and social tact," \nthought he; "been proud of my house, in \nwhich she received all Petersburg, proud of \nher unapproachability and beauty. So this is \nwhat I was proud of! I then thought that I did \nnot understand her. How often when consider- \ning her character I have told myself that I was \nto blame for not understanding her, for not \nunderstanding that constant composure and \ncomplacency and lack of all interests or desires, \nand the whole secret lies in the terrible truth \nthat she is a depraved woman. Now I have \nspoken that terrible word to myself all has be- \ncome clear. \n\n"Anatole used to come to borrow money \nfrom her and used to kiss her naked shoulders. \nShe did not give him the money, but let her- \nself be kissed. Her father in jest tried to rouse \nher jealousy, and she replied with a calm smile \nthat she was not so stupid as to be jealous: 'Let \nhim do what he pleases,' she used to say of me. \nOne day I asked her if she felt any symptoms \nof pregnancy. She laughed contemptuously and \nsaid she was not a fool to want to have chil- \ndren, and that she was not going to have any \nchildren by me." \n\nThen he recalled the coarseness and blunt- \nness of her thoughts and the vulgarity of the \nexpressions that were natural to her, though \nshe had been brought up in the most aristo- \ncratic circles. \n\n"I'm not such a fool. . . . Just you try it on. \n. . . Allez-vous promener/' 1 she used to say. \nOften seeing the success she had with young \nand old men and women Pierre could not un- \nderstand why he did not love her. \n\n"Yes, I never loved her," said he to himself; \n"I knew she was a depraved woman," he re- \npeated, "but dared not admit it to myself. And \nnow there's D61okhov sitting in the snow with \na forced smile and perhaps dying, while meet- \ning my remorse with some forced bravado!" \n\nPierre was one of those people who, in spite \nof an appearance of what is called weak char- \nacter, do not seek a confidant in their troubles. \nHe digested his sufferings alone. \n\n"It is all, all her fault," he said to himself; \n\n1 "You clear out of this." \n\n\n\ni 7 8 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\n"but what of that? Why did I bind myself to \nher? Why did I say 'Je vous aime' l to her, \nwhich was a lie, and worse than a lie? I am \nguilty and must endure . . . what? A slur on \nmy name? A misfortune for life? Oh, that's \nnonsense," he thought. "The slur on my name \nand honor that's all apart from myself. \n\n"Louis XVI was executed because they said \nhe was dishonorable and a criminal," came in- \nto Pierre's head, "and from their point of view \nthey were right, as were those too who canon- \nized him and died a martyr's death for his sake. \nThen Robespierre was beheaded for being a \ndespot. Who is right and who is wrong? No \none! But if you are alive live: tomorrow you'll \ndie as I might have died an hour ago. And is it \nworth tormenting oneself, when one has only \na moment of life in comparison with eternity?" \n\nBut at the moment when he imagined him- \nself calmed by such reflections, she suddenly \ncame into his mind as she was at the moments \nwhen he had most strongly expressed his in- \nsincere love for her, and he felt the blood rush \nto his heart and had again to get up and move \nabout and break and tear whatever came to his \nhand. "Why did I tell her that 'Je vous aime'?" \nhe kept repeating to himself. And when he \nhad said it for the tenth time, Molire's words: \n"Mais que diable alloit-il faire dans cette ga- \nleref" * occurred to him, and he began to laugh \nat himself. \n\nIn the night he called his valet and told him \nto pack up to go to Petersburg. He could not \nimagine how he could speak to her now. He \nresolved to go away next day and leave a letter \ninforming her of his intention to part from \nher forever. \n\nNext morning when the valet came into the \nroom with his coffee, Pierre was lying asleep \non the ottoman with an open book in his hand. \n\nHe woke up and looked round for a while \nwith a startled expression, unable to realize \nwhere he was. \n\n"The countess told me to inquire whether \nyour excellency was at home," said the valet. \n\nBut before Pierre could decide what answer \nhe would send, the countess herself in a white \nsatin dressing gown embroidered with silver \nand with simply dressed hair (two immense \nplaits twice round her lovely head like a coro- \nnet) entered the room, calm and majestic, ex- \ncept that there was a wrathful wrinkle on her \n\n1 1 love you. \n\n8 "What the dickens did he get himself into that \nmess for?" or, more literally, "What the devil was \nhe going to do in that galley?" TR. \n\n\n\nrather prominent marble brow. With her im- \nperturbable calm she did not begin to speak in \nfront of the valet. She knew of the duel and \nhad come to speak about it. She waited till the \nvalet had set down the coffee things and left \nthe room. Pierre looked at her timidly over his \nspectacles, and like a hare surrounded by \nhounds who lays back her ears and continues \nto crouch motionless before her enemies, he \ntried to continue reading. But feeling this to \nbe senseless and impossible, he again glanced \ntimidly at her. She did not sit down but looked \nat him with a contemptuous smile, waiting for \nthe valet to go. \n\n"Well, what's this now? What have you been \nup to now, I should like to know?" she asked \nsternly. \n\n"I? What have I . . . ?" stammered Pierre. \n\n"So it seems you're a hero, eh? Come now, \nwhat was this duel about? What is it meant to \nprove? What? I ask you." \n\nPierre turned over heavily on the ottoman \nand opened his mouth, but could not reply. \n\n"If you won't answer, I'll tell you... "Hellene \nwent on. "You believe everything you're told. \nYou were told . . ." Hdene laughed, "that D6- \nlokhov was my lover," she said in French with \nher coarse plainness of speech, uttering the \nword amant as casually as any otherword, "and \nyou believed it! Well, what have you proved? \nWhat does this duel prove? That you're a fool, \nque vous lies un sot, but everybody knew that. \nWhat will be the result? That I shall be the \nlaughingstock of all Moscow, that everyone \nwill say that you, drunk and not knowing what \nyou were about, challenged a man you are \njealous of without cause." Helene raised her \nvoice and became more and more excited, "A \nman who's a better man than you in every \nway . . ." \n\n"Hm . . . Hm . . . !" growled Pierre, frown- \ning without looking at her, and not moving a \nmuscle. \n\n"And how could you believe he was my \nlover? Why? Because I like his company? If \nyou were cleverer and more agreeable, I should \nprefer yours." \n\n"Don't speak to me ... I beg you," muttered \nPierre hoarsely. \n\n"Why shouldn't I speak? I can speak as I \nlike, and I tell you plainly that there are not \nmany wives with husbands such as you who \nwould not have taken lovers (des amants), but \nI have not done so," said she. \n\nPierre wished to say something, looked at \nher with eyes whose strange expression she did \n\n\n\nBOOK FOUR \n\n\n\n179 \n\n\n\nnot understand, and lay down again. He was \nsuffering physically at that moment, there was \na weight on his chest and he could not breathe. \nHe knew that he must do something to put an \nend to this suffering, but what he wanted to do \nwas too terrible. \n\n"We had better separate," he muttered in a \nbroken voice. \n\n"Separate? Very well, but only if you give \nme a fortune," said H61ne. "Separate! That's \na thing to frighten me with!" \n\nPierre leaped up from the sofa and rushed \nstaggering toward her. \n\n"I'll kill you!" he shouted, and seizing the \nmarble top of a table with a strength he had \nnever before felt, he made a step toward her \nbrandishing the slab. \n\nHlne's face became terrible, she shrieked \nand sprang aside. His father's nature showed \nitself in Pierre. He felt the fascination and de- \nlight of frenzy. He flung down the slab, broke \nit, and swooping down on her with outstretched \nhands shouted, "Get out!" in such a terrible \nvoice that the whole house heard it with hor- \nror. God knows what he would have done at \nthat moment had H^lene not fled from the \nroom. \n\nA week later Pierre gave his wife full power \nto control all his estates in Great Russia, which \nformed the larger part of his property, and left \nfor Petersburg alone. \n\nCHAPTER VII \n\nTwo MONTHS had elapsed since the news of \nthe battle of Austerlitz and the loss of Prince \nAndrew had reached Bald Hills, and in spite \nof the letters sent through the embassy and all \nthe searches made, his body had not been \nfound nor was he on the list of prisoners. What \nwas worst of all for his relations was the fact \nthat there was still a possibility of his having \nbeen picked up on the battlefield by the peo- \nple of the place and that he might now be ly- \ning, recovering or dying, alone among stran- \ngers and unable to send news of himself. The \ngazettes from which the old prince first heard \nof the defeat at Austerlitz stated, as usual very \nbriefly and vaguely, that after brilliant engage- \nments the Russians had had to retreat and had \nmade their withdrawal in perfect order. The \nold prince understood from this official report \nthat our army had been defeated. A week after \nthe gazette report of the battle of Austerlitz \ncame a letter from Kutiizov informing the \nprince of the fate that had befallen his son. \n\n\n\n"Your son," wrote Kutiizov, "fell before my \neyes, a standard in his hand and at the head of \na regiment he fell as a hero, worthy of his fa- \nther and his fatherland. To the great regret of \nmyself and of the whole army it is still uncer- \ntain whether he is alive or not. I comfort my- \nself and you with the hope that your son is \nalive, for otherwise he would have been men- \ntioned among the officers found on the field of \nbattle, a list of whom has been sent me under \nflag of truce." \n\nAfter receiving this news late in the evening, \nwhen he was alone in his study, the old prince \nwent for his walk as usual next morning, but \nhe was silent with his steward, the gardener, \nand the architect, and though he looked very \ngrim he said nothing to anyone. \n\nWhen Princess Mary went to him at the us- \nual hour he was working at his lathe and, as \nusual, did not look round at her. \n\n"Ah, Princess Mary!" he said suddenly in an \nunnatural voice, throwing down his chisel. \n(The wheel continued to revolve by its own \nimpetus, and Princess Mary long remembered \nthe dying creak of that wheel, which merged \nin her memory with what followed.) \n\nShe approached him, saw his face, and some- \nthing gave way within her. Her eyes grew dim. \nBy the expression of her father's face, not sad, \nnot crushed, but angry and working unnatural- \nly, she saw that hanging over her and about to \ncrush her was some terrible misfortune, the \nworst in life, one she had not yet experienced, \nirreparable and incomprehensible the death \nof one she loved. \n\n"Father! Andrew!" said the ungraceful, \nawkward princess with such an indescribable \ncharm of sorrow and self-forgetfulness that \nher father could not bear her look but turned \naway with a sob. \n\n"Bad news! He's not among the prisoners \nnor among the killed! Kutuzov writes . . ." and \nhe screamed as piercingly as if he wished to \ndrive the princess away by that scream . . . \n"Killed!" \n\nThe princess did not fall down or faint. She \nwas already pale, but on hearing these words \nher face changed and something brightened in \nher beautiful, radiant eyes. It was as if joy a \nsupreme joy apart from the joys and sorrows of \nthis world overflowed the great grief within \nher. She forgot all fear of her father, went up \nto him, took his hand, and drawing him down \nput her arm round his thin, scraggy neck. \n\n"Father," she said, "do not turn away from \nme, let us weep together." \n\n\n\ni8o \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\n"Scoundrels! Blackguards 1" shrieked the old \nman, turning his face away from her. "Destroy- \ning the army, destroying the men! And why? \nGo, go and tell Lise." \n\nThe princess sank helplessly into an arm- \nchair beside her father and wept. She saw her \nbrother now as he had been at the moment \nwhen he took leave of her and of Lise, his look \ntender yet proud. She saw him tender and \namused as he was when he put on the little \nicon. "Did he believe? Had he repented of his \nunbelief? Was he now there? There in the \nrealms of eternal peace and blessedness?" she \nthought. \n\n"Father, tell me how it happened," she asked \nthrough her tears. \n\n"Go! Go! Killed in battle, where the best of \nRussian men and Russia's glory were led to de- \nstruction. Go, Princess Mary. Go and tell Lise. \nI will follow." \n\nWhen Princess Mary returned from her fa- \nther, the little princess sat working and looked \nup with that curious expression of inner, hap- \npy calm peculiar to pregnant women. It was \nevident that her eyes did not see Princess Mary \nbut were looking within . . . into herself ... at \nsomething joyful and mysterious taking place \nwithin her. \n\n"Mary," she said, moving away from the \nembroidery frame and lying back, "give me \nyour hand." She took her sister-in-law's hand \nand held it below her waist. \n\nHer eyes were smilingexpectantly, her downy \nlip rose and remained lifted in childlike hap- \npiness. \n\nPrincess Mary knelt down before her and \nhid her face in the folds of her sister-in-law's \ndress. \n\n"There, there! Do you feel it? I feel so \nstrange. And do you know, Mary, I am going \nto love him very much," said Lise, looking \nwith bright and happy eyes at her sister-in-law. \n\nPrincess Mary could not lift her head, she \nwas weeping. \n\n"What is the matter, Mary?" \n\n"Nothing . . . only I feel sad . . . sad about \nAndrew," she said, wiping away her tears on \nher sister-in-law's knee. \n\nSeveral times in the course of the morning \nPrincess Mary began trying to prepare her sis- \nter-in-law, and every time began to cry. Unob- \nservant as was the little princess, these tears, \nthe cause of which she did not understand, \nagitated her. She said nothing but looked \nabout uneasily as if in search of something. Be- \nfore dinner the old prince, of whom she was \n\n\n\nalways afraid, came into her room with a pe- \nculiarly restless and malign expression and \nwent out again without saying a word. She \nlooked at Princess Mary, then sat thinking for \na while with that expression of attention to \nsomething within her that is only seen in preg- \nnant women, and suddenly began to cry. \n\n"Has anything come from Andrew?" she \nasked. \n\n"No, you know it's too soon for news. But \nmy father is anxious and I feel afraid." \n\n"So there's nothing?" \n\n"Nothing," answered Princess Mary, look- \ning firmly with her radiant eyes at her sister-in- \nlaw. \n\nShe had determined not to tell her and per- \nsuaded her father to hide the terrible news \nfrom her till after her confinement, which was \nexpected within a few days. Princess Mary and \nthe old prince each bore and hid their grief in \ntheir own way. The old prince would not cher- \nish any hope: he made up his mind that Prince \nAndrew had been killed, and though he sent \nan official to Austria to seek for traces of his \nson, he ordered a monument from Moscow \nwhich he intended to erect in his own garden \nto his memory, and he told everybody that his \nson had been killed. He tried not to change his \nformer way of life, but his strength failed him. \nHe walked less, ate less, slept less, and became \nweaker every day. Princess Mary hoped. She \nprayed for her brother as living and was al- \nways awaiting news of his return. \n\nCHAPTER VIII \n\nDEAREST," said the little princess after break- \nfast on themorningof thenineteenthof March, \nand her downy little lip rose from old habit, \nbut as sorrow was manifest in every smile, the \nsound of every word, and even every footstep \nin that house since the terrible news had come, \nso now the smile of the little princess influ- \nenced by the general mood though without \nknowing its cause was such as to remind one \nstill more of the general sorrow. \n\n"Dearest, I'm afraid this morning's fruschti- \nque * as F6ka the cook calls it has disagreed \nwith me." \n\n"What is the matter with you, my darling? \nYou look pale. Oh, you are very pale!" said \nPrincess Mary in alarm, running with her soft, \nponderous steps up to her sister-in-law. \n\n"Your excellency, should not Mary Bogda- \nnovna be sent for?" said one of the maids who \nwas present. (Mary Bogddnovna was a mid- \n\n1 Fruhstiick: breakfast. \n\n\n\nBOOK FOUR \n\n\n\n181 \n\n\n\nwife from the neighboring town, who had been \nat Bald Hills for the last fortnight.) \n\n"Oh yes," assented Princess Mary, "perhaps \nthat's it. I'll go. Courage, my angel." She kissed \nLise and was about to leave the room. \n\n"Oh, no, no!" And besides the pallor and \nthe physical suffering on the little princess' \nface, an expression of childish fear of inevit- \nable pain showed itself. \n\n"No, it's only indigestion! . . . Say it's only \nindigestion, say so, Mary! Say . . ." And the lit- \ntle princess began to cry capriciously like a \nsuffering child and to wring her little hands \neven with some affectation. Princess Mary ran \nout of the room to fetch Mary Bogda* novna. \n\n"Mon T&gt;ieu! Mon Dieu! Oh!" she heard as \nshe left the room. \n\nThe midwife was already on her way to meet \nher, rubbing her small, plump white hands \nwith an air of calm importance. \n\n"Mary Bogddnovna, I think it's beginning!" \nsaid Princess Mary looking at the midwifewith \nwide-open eyes of alarm. \n\n"Well, the Lord be thanked, Princess," said \nMary Bogdnovna, not hastening her steps. \n"You young ladies should not know anything \nabout it." \n\n"But how is it the doctor from Moscow is \nnot here yet?" said the princess. (In accord- \nance with Lise's and Prince Andrew's wishes \nthey had sent in good time to Moscow for a \ndoctor and were expecting him at any mo- \nment.) \n\n"No matter, Princess, don't be alarmed,"said \nMary Bogdnovna. "We'll manage very well \nwithout a doctor." \n\nFive minutes later Princess Mary from her \nroom heard something heavy being carried by. \nShe looked out. The menservants were carry- \ning the large leather sofa from Prince An- \ndrew's study into the bedroom. On their faces \nwas a quiet and solemn look. \n\nPrincess Mary sat alone in her room listen- \ning to the sounds in the house, now and then \nopening her door when someone passed and \nwatching what was going on in the passage. \nSome women passing with quiet steps in and \nout of the bedroom glanced at the princess and \nturned away. She did not venture to ask any \nquestions, and shut the door again, now sitting \ndown in her easy chair, now taking her prayer \nbook, now kneeling before the icon stand. To \nher surprise and distress she found that her \nprayers did not calm her excitement. Suddenly \nher door opened softly and her old nurse, Pra- \nsk6vya Sdvishna, who hardly ever came to that \n\n\n\nroom as the old prince had forbidden it, ap- \npeared on the threshold with a shawl round \nher head. \n\n"I've come to sit with you a bit, Mdsha," said \nthe nurse, "and here I've brought the prince's \nwedding candles to light before his saint, my \nangel," she said with a sigh. \n\n"Oh, nurse, I'm so glad!" \n\n"God is merciful, birdie." \n\nThe nurse lit the gilt candles before the \nicons and sat down by the door with her knit- \nting. Princess Mary took a book and began \nreading. Only when footsteps or voices were \nheard did they look at one another, the prin- \ncess anxious and inquiring, the nurse encour- \naging. Everyone in the house was dominated \nby the same feeling that Princess Mary experi- \nenced as she sat in her room. But owing to the \nsuperstition that the fewer the people who \nknow of it the less a woman in travail suffers, \neveryone tried to pretend not to know; no \none spoke of it, but apart from the ordinary \nstaid and respectful good manners habitual in \nthe prince's household, a common anxiety, a \nsoftening of the heart, and a consciousness \nthat something great and mysterious was be- \ning accomplished at that moment made itself \nfelt. \n\nThere was no laughter in the maids' large \nhall. In the menservants' hall all sat waiting, \nsilently and alert. In the outlying serfs' quar- \nters torches and candles were burning and no \none slept. The old prince, stepping on his \nheels, paced up and down his study and sent \nTikhon to ask Mary Bogddnovna what news. \n"Say only that 'the prince told me to ask,' and \ncome and tell me her answer." \n\n"Inform the prince that labor has begun," \nsaid Mary Bogddnovna, giving the messenger a \nsignificant look. \n\nTfkhon went and told the prince. \n\n"Very good!" said the prince closing the \ndoor behind him, and Tikhon did not hear \nthe slightest sound from the study after that. \n\nAfter a while he re-entered it as if to snuff \nthe candles, and, seeing the prince was lying \non the sofa, looked at him, noticed his per- \nturbed face, shook his head, and going up to \nhim silently kissed him on the shoulder and \nleft the room without snuffing the candles or \nsaying why he had entered. The most solemn \nmystery in the world continued its course. \nEvening passed, night came, and the feeling of \nsuspense and softening of heart in the presence \nof the unfathomable did not lessen but in- \ncreased. No one slept. \n\n\n\ni8* \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nIt was one of those March nights when win- \nter seems to wish to resume its sway and scat- \nters its last snows and storms with desperate \nfury. A relay of horses had been sent up the \nhighroad to meet the German doctor from \nMoscow who was expected every moment, and \nmen on horseback with lanterns were sent to \nthe crossroads to guide him over the country \nroad with its hollows and snow-covered pools \nof water. \n\nPrincess Mary had long since put aside her \nbook: she sat silent, her luminous eyes fixed on \nher nurse's wrinkled face (every line of which \nshe knew so well), on the lock of gray hair that \nescaped from under the kerchief, and the loose \nskin that hung under her chin. \n\nNurse Sdvishna, knitting in hand, was tell- \ning in low tones, scarcely hearing or under- \nstanding her own words, what she had told \nhundreds of times before: how the late prin- \ncess had given birth to Princess Mary in Kish- \nenev with only a Moldavian peasant woman to \nhelp instead of a midwife. \n\n"God is merciful, doctors are never needed," \nshe said. \n\nSuddenly a gust of wind beat violently a- \ngainst the casement of the window, from which \nthe double frame had been removed (by order \nof the prince, one window frame was removed \nin each room as soon as the larks returned), \nand, forcing open a loosely closed latch, set the \ndamask curtain flapping and blew out the can- \ndle with its chill, snowy draft. Princess Mary \nshuddered; her nurse, putting down the stock- \ning she was knitting, went to the window and \nleaning out tried to catch the open casement. \nThe cold wind flapped the ends of her ker- \nchief and her loose locks of gray hair. \n\n"Princess, my dear, there's someone driving \nup the avenue!" she said, holding the casement \nand not closing it. "With lanterns. Most likely \nthe doctor." \n\n"Oh, my God! thank God!" said Princess \nMary. "I must go and meet him, he does not \nknow Russian." \n\nPrincess Mary threw a shawl over her head \nand ran to meet the newcomer. As she was \ncrossing the anteroom she saw through the \nwindow a carriage with lanterns, standing at \nthe entrance. She went out on the stairs. On a \nbani&amp;ter post stood a tallow candle which gut- \ntered in the draft. On the landing below, \nPhilip, the footman, stood looking scared and \nholding another candle. Still lower, beyond \nthe turn of the staircase, one could hear the \nfootstep of someone in thick felt boots, and a \n\n\n\nvoice that seemed familiar to Princess Mary \nwas saying something. \n\n"Thank God!" said the voice. "And Father?" \n\n"Gone to bed," replied the voice of Demydn \nthe house steward, who was downstairs. \n\nThen the voice said something more, Dem- \nydn replied, and the steps in the felt boots ap- \nproached the unseen bend of the staircase more \nrapidly. \n\n"It's Andrew!" thought Princess Mary. "No \nit can't be, that would be too extraordinary," \nand at the very moment she thought this, the \nface and figure of Prince Andrew, in a fur \ncloak the deep collar of which was covered with \nsnow, appeared on the landing where the foot- \nman stood with the candle. Yes, it was he, pale, \nthin, with a changed and strangely softened \nbut agitated expression on his face. He came \nup the stairs and embraced his sister. \n\n"You did not get my letter?" he asked, and \nnot waiting for a reply which he would not \nhave received, for the princess was unable to \nspeak he turned back, rapidly mounted the \nstairs again with the doctor who had entered \nthe hall after him (they had met at the last \npost station), and again embraced his sister. \n\n"What a strange fate, Msha darling!" And \nhaving taken off his cloak and felt boots, he \nwent to the little princess' apartment. \n\nCHAPTER IX \n\nTHE LITTLE PRINCESS lay supported by pillows, \nwith a white cap on her head (the pains had \njust left her). Strands of her black hair lay \nround her inflamed and perspiring cheeks, her \ncharming rosy mouth with its downy lip was \nopen and she was smiling joyfully. Prince An- \ndrew entered and paused facing her at the foot \nof the sofa on which she was lying. Her glitter- \ning eyes, filled with childlike fear and excite- \nment, rested on him without changing their \nexpression. "I love you all and have done no \nharm to anyone; why must I suffer so? Help \nme!" her look seemed to say. She saw her hus- \nband, but did not realize the significance of his \nappearance before her now. Prince Andrew \nwent round the sofa and kissed her forehead. \n\n"My darling!" he said a word he had never \nused to her before. "God is merciful. . . ." \n\nShe looked at him inquiringly and with child- \nlike reproach. \n\n"I expected help from you and I get none, \nnone from you either 1" said her eyes. She was \nnot surprised at his having come; she did not \nrealize that he had come. His coming had noth- \ning to do with her sufferings or with their re- \n\n\n\nBOOK FOUR \n\n\n\nlief. The pangs began again and Mary Bogdd- \nnovna advised Prince Andrew to leave the \nroom. \n\nThe doctor entered. Prince Andrew went \nout and, meeting Princess Mary, again joined \nher. They began talking in whispers, but their \ntalk broke off at every moment. They waited \nand listened. \n\n"Go, dear," said Princess Mary. \n\nPrince Andrew went again to his wife and \nsat waiting in the room next to hers. A woman \ncame from the bedroom with a frightened face \nand became confused when she saw Prince An- \ndrew. He covered his face with his hands and \nremained so for some minutes. Piteous, help- \nless, animal moans came through the door. \nPrince Andrew got up, went to the door, and \ntried to open it. Someone was holding it shut. \n\n"You can't come in! You can't!" said a terri- \nfied voice from within. \n\nHe began pacing the room. The screaming \nceased, and a few more seconds went by. Then \nsuddenly a terrible shriek it could not be hers, \nshe could not scream like that came from the \nbedroom. Prince Andrew ran to the door; the \nscream ceased and he heard the wail of an in- \nfant. \n\n"What have they taken a baby in there for?" \nthought Prince Andrew in the first second. "A \nbaby? What baby . . . ? Why is there a baby \nthere? Or is the baby born?" \n\nThen suddenly he realized the joyful signif- \nicance of that wail; tears choked him, and \nleaning his elbows on the window sill be began \nto cry, sobbing like a child. The door opened. \nThe doctor with his shirt sleeves tucked up, \nwithout a coat, pale and with a trembling jaw, \ncame out of the room. Prince Andrew turned \nto him, but the doctor gave him a bewildered \nlook and passed by without a word. A woman \nrushed out and seeing Prince Andrew stopped, \nhesitating on the threshold. He went into his \nwife's room. She was lying dead, in the same \nposition he had seen her in five minutes be- \nfore and, despite the fixed eyes and the pallor \nof the cheeks, the same expression was on her \ncharming childlike face with its upper lip cov- \nered with tiny black hair. \n\n"I love you all, and have done no harm to \nanyone; and what have you done to me?" \nsaid her charming, pathetic, dead face. \n\nIn a corner of the room something red and \ntiny gave a grunt and squealed in Mary Bog- \nddnovna's trembling white hands. \n\nTwo hours later Prince Andrew, stepping \n\n\n\nsoftly, went into his father's room. The old \nman already knew everything. He was stand- \ning close to the door and as soon as it opened \nhis rough old arms closed like a vise round his \nson's neck, and without a word he began to sob \nlike a child. \n\nThree days later the little princess was buried, \nand Prince Andrew went up the steps to where \nthe coffin stood, to give her the farewell kiss. \nAnd there in the coffin was the same face, \nthough with closed eyes. "Ah, what have you \ndone to me?" it still seemed to say, and Prince \nAndrew felt that something gave way in his \nsoul and that he was guilty of a sin he could \nneither remedy nor forget. He could not weep. \nThe old man too came up and kissed the wax- \nen little hands that lay quietly crossed one on \nthe other on her breast, and to him, too, her \nface seemed to say: "Ah, what have you done \nto me, and why?" And at the sight the old man \nturned angrily away. \n\nAnother five days passed, and thentheyoung \nPrince Nicholas Andntevich was baptized. The \nwet nurse supported the coverlet with her chin, \nwhile the priest with a goose feather anointed \nthe boy's little red and wrinkled soles and \npalms. \n\nHis grandfather, who was his godfather, trem- \nbling and afraid of dropping him, carried the \ninfant round the battered tin font and handed \nhim over to the godmother, Princess Mary. \nPrince Andrew sat in another room, faint with \nfear lest the baby should be drowned in the \nfont, and awaited the termination of the cere- \nmony. He looked up joyfully at the baby when \nthe nurse brought it to him and nodded ap- \nproval when she told him that the wax with \nthe baby's hair had not sunk in the font but \nhad floated. \n\nCHAPTER X \n\nROSTOV'S SHARE in D61okhov's duel with Be- \nziikhov was hushed up by the efforts of the old \ncount, and instead of being degraded to the \nranks as he expected he was appointed an ad- \njutant to the governor general of Moscow. As \na result he could not go to the country with \nthe rest of the family, but was kept all summer \nin Moscow by his new duties. D61okhov recov- \nered, and Rost6v became very friendly with \nhim during his convalescence. D61okhov lay ill \nat his mother's who loved him passionately and \ntenderly, and old Mary Ivnovna, who had \ngrown fond of Rost6v for his friendship to her \n\n\n\n184 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nFdya, often talked to him about her son. \n\n"Yes, Count," she would say, "he is too no- \nble and pure-souled for our present, depraved \nworld. No one now loves virtue; it seems like \na reproach to everyone. Now tell me, Count, \nwas it right, was it honorable, of Beziikhov? \nAnd Fdya, with his noble spirit, loved him \nand even now never says a word against him. \nThose pranks in Petersburg when they played \nsome tricks on a policeman, didn't they do it \ntogether? And therel Beziikhov got off scot- \nfree, while F6dya had to bear the whole bur- \nJen on his shoulders. Fancy what he had to go \nthrough! It's true he has been reinstated, but \nhow could they fail to do that? I think there \nwere not many such gallant sons of the father- \nland out there as he. And now this duel! \nHave these people no feeling, or honor? Know- \ning him to be an only son, to challenge him \nand shoot so straight! It's well God had mercy \non us. And what was it for? Who doesn't have \nintrigues nowadays? Why, if he was so jealous, \nas I see things he should have shown it sooner, \nbut he lets it go on for months. And then to \ncall him out, reckoning on Fdya not fighting \nbecause he owed him money! What baseness! \nWhat meanness! I know you understand Fe"d- \nya, my dear count; that, believe me, is why I \nam so fond of you. Few people do understand \nhim. He is such a lofty, heavenly soul!" \n\nD61okhov himself during his convalescence \nspoke to Rost6v in a way no one would have \nexpected of him. \n\n"I know people consider me a bad man!" he \nsaid. "Let them! I don't care a straw about any- \none but those I love; but those I love, I love so \nthat I would give my life for them, and the oth- \ners I'd throttle if they stood in my way. I have \nan adored, a priceless mother, and two or three \nfriends you among them and as for the rest \nI only care about them in so far as they are \nharmful or useful. And most of them are harm- \nful, especially the women. Yes, dear boy," he \ncontinued, "I have met loving, noble, high- \nminded men, but I have not yet met any wom- \nencountesses or cooks who were not venal. I \nhave not yet met that divine purity and devo- \ntion I look for in women. If I found such a one \nI'd give my life for her! But those! . . ." and he \nmade a gesture of contempt. "And believe me, \nif I still value my life it is only because I still \nhope to meet such a divine creature, who will \nregenerate, purify, and elevate me. But you \ndon't understand it." \n\n"Oh, yes, I quite understand," answered Ros- \ntov, who was under his new friend's influence. \n\n\n\nIn the autumn the Rost6vs returned to Mos- \ncow. Early in the winter Denfsov also came \nback and stayed with them. The first half of \nthe winter of 1806, which Nicholas Rost6v \nspent in Moscow, was one of the happiest, mer- \nriest times for him and the whole family. Nich- \nolas brought many young men to his parents' \nhouse. Ve'ra was a handsome girl of twenty; \nSdnya a girl of sixteen with all the charm of an \nopening flower; Natdsha, half grown up and \nhalf child, was now childishly amusing, now \ngirlishly enchanting. \n\nAt that time in the Rost6vs' house there pre- \nvailed an amorous atmosphere characteristic \nof homes where there are very young and very \ncharming girls. Every young man who came to \nthe house seeing those impressionable, smil- \ning young faces (smiling probably at their own \nhappiness), feeling the eager bustle around \nhim, and hearing the fitful bursts of song and \nmusic and the inconsequent but friendly prat- \ntle* of young girls ready for anything and full \nof hope experienced the same feeling; shar- \ning with the young folk of the Rost6vs' house- \nhold a readiness to fall in love and an expecta- \ntion of happiness. \n\nAmong the young men introduced byRost6v \none of the first was D61okhov, whom everyone \nin the house liked except Natdsha. She almost \nquarreled with her brother about him. She in- \nsisted that he was a bad man, and that in the \nduel with Beziikhov, Pierre was right and D6- \nlokhov wrong, and further that he was disa- \ngreeable and unnatural. \n\n"There's nothing for me to understand," she \ncried out with resolute self-will, "he is wicked \nand heartless. There now, I like your Denisov \nthough he is a rake and all that, still I like him; \nso you see I do understand. I don't know how \nto put it ... with this one everything is calcu- \nlated, and I don't like that. But Denfsov . . ." \n\n"Oh, Denfsov is quite different," replied \nNicholas, implying that even Denfsov was noth- \ning compared to D61okhov "you must under- \nstand what a soul there is in D61okhov, you \nshould see him with his mother. Whata heart!" \n\n"Well, I don't know about that, but I am \nuncomfortable with him. And do you know he \nhas fallen in love with S6nya?" \n\n"What nonsense. . . ." \n\n"I'm certain of it; you'll see." \n\nNatasha's prediction proved true. D61okhov, \nwho did not usually care for the society of la- \ndies, began to come often to the house, and the \nquestion for whose sake he came (though no \none spoke of it) was soon settled. He came be- \n\n\n\ncause of S6nya. And S6nya, though she would \nnever have dared to say so, knew it and blushed \nscarlet every time D61okhov appeared. \n\nD61okhov often dined at the Rost6vs', never \nmissed a performance at which they were pres- \nent, and went to logel's balls for young people \nwhich the Rostovs always attended. He was \npointedly attentive to S6nya and looked at her \nin such a way that not only could she not bear \nhis glances without coloring, but even the old \ncountess and Natasha blushed when they saw \nhis looks. \n\nIt was evident that this strange, strong man \nwas under the irresistible influence of the dark, \ngraceful girl who loved another. \n\nRost6v noticed something new in D61okhov's \nrelations with S6nya, but he did not explain to \nhimself what these new relations were. "They're \nalways in love with someone," he thought \nof S6nya and Natdsha. But he was not as much \nat ease with S6nya and D61okhov as before and \nwas less frequently at home. \n\nIn the autumn of 1806 everybody had again \nbegun talking of the war with Napoleon with \neven greater warmth than the year before. Or- \nders were given to raise recruits, ten men in \nevery thousand for the regular army, and be- \nsides this, nine men in every thousand for the \nmilitia. Everywhere Bonaparte was anathema- \ntized and in Moscow nothing but the coming \nwar was talked of. For the Rostov family the \nwhole interest of these preparations for war \nlay in the fact that Nicholas would not hear of \nremaining in Moscow, and only awaited the \ntermination of Denfsov's furlough afterChrist- \nmas to return with him to their regiment. His \napproaching departure did not prevent his \namusing himself, but rather gave zest to his \npleasures. He spent the greater part of his time \naway from home, at dinners, parties, and balls. \n\nCHAPTER XI \n\nON THE THIRD DAY after Christmas Nicholas \ndined at home, a thing he had rarely done of \nlate. It was a grand farewell dinner, as he and \nDenfsov were leaving to join their regiment \nafter Epiphany. About twenty people were \npresent, including D61okhov and Denfsov. \n\nNever had love been so much in the air, and \nnever had the amorous atmosphere made itself \nso strongly felt in the Rost6vs' house as at this \nholiday time. "Seize the moments of happi- \nness, love and be lovedl That is the only reality \nin the world, all else is folly. It is the one thing \nwe are interested in here," said the spirit of \nthe place. \n\n\n\nBOOK FOUR 185 \n\nNicholas, having as usual exhausted two \n\n\n\npairs of horses, without visiting all the places \nhe meant to go to and where he had been in- \nvited, returned home just before dinner. As \nsoon as he entered he noticed and felt the ten- \nsion of the amorous air in the house, and also \nnoticed a curious embarrassment among some \nof those present. S6nya, D61okhov, and the old \ncountess were especially disturbed, and to a \nlesser degree Natdsha. Nicholas understood that \nsomething must have happened between S6n- \nya and Dolokhov before dinner, and with the \nkindly sensitiveness natural to him was very \ngentle and wary with them both at dinner. On \nthat same evening there was to be one of the \nballs that logel (the dancing master) gave for \nhis pupils durings the holidays. \n\n"Nicholas, will you come to logel's? Please \ndol" said Natdsha. "He asked you, and Vasfli \nDmftrich * is also going." \n\n"Where would I not go at the countess' com- \nmand!" said Denfsov, who at the Rostovs' had \njocularly assumed the role of Natdsha's knight. \n"I'm even weady to dance the pas de chdle." \n\n"If I have time," answered Nicholas. "But I \npromised the Arkhdrovs; they have a party." \n\n"And you?" he asked D61okhov, but as soon \nas he had asked the question he noticed that it \nshould not have been put. \n\n"Perhaps," coldly and angrily replied D6- \nlokhov, glancing at S6nya, and, scowling, he \ngave Nicholas just such a look as he had given \nPierre at the Club dinner. \n\n"There is something up," thought Nicholas, \nand he was further confirmed in this conclu- \nsion by the fact that D61okhov left immediate- \nly after dinner. He called Natdsha and asked \nher what was the matter. \n\n"And I was looking for you," said Natdsha \nrunning out to him. "I told you, but you would \nnot believe it," she said triumphantly. "He has \nproposed to S6nya!" \n\nLittle as Nicholas had occupied himself with \nS6nya of late, something seemed to give way \nwithin him at this news. D61okhov was a suit- \nable and in some respects a brilliant match for \nthe dowerless, orphan girl. From the point of \nview of the old countess and of society it was \nout of the question for her to refuse him. And \ntherefore Nicholas' first feeling on hearing the \nnews was one of anger with Sonya. . . . He tried \nto say, "That's capital; of course she'll forget \nher childish promises and accept the offer," \nbut before he had time to say it Natdsha began \nagain. \n\n1 Denfsov. \n\n\n\ni86 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\n"And fancy! she refused him quite definite- \nly!" adding, after a pause, "she told him she \nloved another." \n\n"Yes, my S6nya could not have done other- \nwise!" thought Nicholas. \n\n"Much as Mamma pressed her, she refused, \nand I know she won't change once she has \nsaid . . ." \n\n"And Mamma pressed her!" said Nicholas \nreproachfully. \n\n"Yes," said Natdsha. "Do you know, Nich- \nolasdon't be angrybut I know you will not \nmarry her. I know, heaven knows how, but I \nknow for certain that you won't marry her." \n\n"Now you don't know that at all! "said Nich- \nolas. "But I must talk to her. What a darling \nS6nya is!" he added with a smile. \n\n"Ah, she is indeed a darling! I'll send her to \nyou." \n\nAnd Natasha kissed her brother and ran \naway. \n\nA minute later S6nya came in with a fright- \nened, guilty, and scared look. Nicholas went \nup to her and kissed her hand. This was the \nfirst time since his return that they had talked \nalone and about their love. \n\n"Sophie," he began, timidly at first and then \nmore and more boldly, "if you wish to refuse \none who is not only a brilliant and advanta- \ngeous match but a splendid, noble fellow . . . \nhe is my friend ..." \n\nS6nya interrupted him. \n\n"I have already refused," she said hurriedly. \n\n"If you are refusing for my sake, I am afraid \nthat I ..." \n\nS6nya again interrupted. She gave him an \nimploring, frightened look. \n\n"Nicholas, don't tell me that!" she said. \n\n"No, but I must. It may be arrogant of me, \nbut still it is best to say it. If you refuse him on \nmy account, I must tell you the whole truth. \nI love you, and I think I love you more than \nanyone else. . . ." \n\n"That is enough for me," said S6nya, blush- \ning. \n\n"No, but I have been in love a thousand \ntimes and shall fall in love again, though for \nno one have I such a feeling of friendship, \nconfidence, and love as I have for you. Then I \nam young. Mamma does not wish it. In a word, \nI make no promise. And I beg you to consider \nDolokhov's offer," he said, articulating his \nfriend's name with difficulty. \n\n"Don't say that to me! I want nothing. I love \nyou as a brother and always shall, and I want \nnothing more." \n\n\n\n"You are an angel: I am not worthy of you, \nbut I am afraid of misleading you." \nAnd Nicholas again kissed her hand. \n\nCHAPTER XII \n\nIOGEL'S WERE the most enjoyable balls in Mos- \ncow. So said the mothers as they watched their \nyoung people executing their newly learned \nsteps, and so said the youths and maidens them- \nselves as they danced till they were ready to \ndrop, and so said the grown-up young men and \nwomen who came to these balls with an air of \ncondescension and found them most enjoyable. \nThat year two marriages had come of these \nballs. The two pretty young Princesses Gor- \nchak6v met suitors there and were married and \nso further increased the fame of these dances. \nWhat distinguished them from others was the \nabsence of host or hostess and the presence of \nthe good-natured logel, flying about like a \nfeather and bowing according to the rules of \nhis art, as he collected the tickets from all his \nvisitors. There was the fact that only those \ncame who wished to dance and amuse them- \nselves as girls of thirteen and fourteen do who \nare wearing long dresses for the first time. With \nscarcely any exceptions they all were, or seemed \nto be, pretty so rapturous were their smiles \nand so sparkling their eyes. Sometimes the best \nof the pupils, of whom Natasha, who was ex- \nceptionally graceful, was first, even danced the \npas de chdle, but at this last ball only the Jcos&gt; \nsaise, the anglaise, and the mazurka, which was \njust coming into fashion, were danced, logel \nhad taken a ballroom in Bezukhov's house, and \nthe ball, as everyone said, was a great success. \nThere were many pretty girls and the Rost6v \ngirls were among the prettiest. They were both \nparticularly happy and gay. That evening, \nproud of D61okhov's proposal, her refusal, and \nher explanation with Nicholas, S6nya twirled \nabout before she left home so that the maid \ncould hardly get her hair plaited, and she was \ntransparently radiant with impulsive joy. \n\nNatdsha no less proud of her first long dress \nand of being at a real ball was even happier. \nThey were both dressed in white muslin with \npink ribbons. \n\nNatdsha fell in love the very moment she en- \ntered the ballroom. She was not in love with \nanyone in particular, but with everyone. What- \never person she happened to look at she was in \nlove with for that moment. \n\n"Oh, how delightful it is!" she kept saying, \nrunning up to S6nya. \n\nNicholas and Denisov were walking up and \n\n\n\nBOOK FOUR \n\n\n\n187 \n\n\n\ndown, looking with kindly patronage at the \ndancers. \n\n"How sweet she is she will be a weal beau- \nty 1" saidDenisov. \n\n"Who?" \n\n"Countess Natasha," answered Denisov. \n\n"And how she dances! What gwace!" he said \nagain after a pause. \n\n"Who are you talking about?" \n\n"About your sister," ejaculated Denisov tes- \ntily. \n\nRost6v smiled. \n\n"My dear count, you were one of my best pu- \npils you must dance," said little logel coming \nup to Nicholas. "Look how many charming \nyoung ladies" He turned with the same re- \nquest to Denisov who was also a former pupil \nof his. \n\n"No, my dear fellow, I'll be a wallflower," \nsaid Denisov. "Don't you wecollect what bad \nuse I made of your lessons?" \n\n"Oh no!" said logel, hastening to reassure \nhim. "You were only inattentive, but you had \ntalentoh yes, you had talent!" \n\nThe band struck up the newly introduced \nmazurka. Nicholas could not refuse logel and \nasked S6nya to dance. Denfsov sat down by the \nold ladies and, leaning on his saber and beat- \ning time with his foot, told them something \nfunny and kept them amused, while he watched \nthe young people dancing, logel with Natdsha, \nhis pride and his best pupil, were the first cou- \nple. Noiselessly, skillfully stepping with his lit- \ntle feet in low shoes, logel flew first across the \nhall with Natasha, who, though shy, went on \ncarefully executing her steps. Denfsov did not \ntake his eyes off her and beat time with his \nsaber in a way that clearly indicated that if he \nwas not dancing it was because he would not \nand not because he could not. In the middle \nof a figure he beckoned to Rost6v who was \npassing: \n\n"This is not at all the thing," he said. "What \nsort of Polish mazuwka is this? But she does \ndance splendidly." \n\nKnowing that Denisov had a reputation \neven in Poland for the masterly way in which \nhe danced the mazurka, Nicholas ran up to \nNatasha: \n\n"Go and choose Denfsov. He is a real dancer, \na wonder!" he said. \n\nWhen it came to Natdsha's turn to choose a \npartner, she rose and, tripping rapidly across \nin her little shoes trimmed with bows, ran tim- \nidly to the corner where Denfsov sat. She saw \nthat everybody was looking at her and waiting. \n\n\n\nNicholas saw that Denfsov was refusing though \nhe smiled delightedly. He ran up to them. \n\n"Please, Vasfli Dmftrich," Natdsha was say- \ning, "do come!" \n\n"Oh no, let me off, Countess," Denfsov re- \nplied. \n\n"Now then, Vdska," said Nicholas. \n\n"They coax me as if I were Vdska the cat!" \nsaid Denfsov jokingly. \n\n"I'll sing for you a whole evening," said Na- \ntdsha. \n\n"Oh, the faiwy! She can do anything with \nme!" said Denfsov, and he unhooked his saber. \nHe came out from behind the chairs, clasped \nhis partner's hand firmly, threw back his head, \nand advanced his foot, waiting for the beat. \nOnly on horse back and in the mazurka was \nDenfsov's short stature not noticeable and he \nlooked the fine fellow he felt himself to be. At \nthe right beat of the music he looked sideways \nat his partner with a merry and triumphant \nair, suddenly stamped with one foot, bounded \nfrom the floor like a ball, and flew round the \nroom taking his partner with him. He glided \nsilently on one foot half across the room, and \nseeming not to notice the chairs was dashing \nstraight at them, when suddenly, clinking his \nspurs and spreading out his legs, he stopped \nshort on his heels, stood so a second, stamped \non the spot clanking his spurs, whirled rapidly \nround, and, striking his left heel against his \nright, flew round again in a circle. Natdsha \nguessed what he meant to do, and abandoning \nherself to him followed his lead hardly know- \ning how. First he spun her round, holding her \nnow with his left, now with his right hand, then \nfalling on one knee he twirled her round him, \nand again jumping up, dashed so impetuously \nforward that it seemed as if he would rush \nthrough the whole suite of rooms without draw- \ning breath, and then he suddenly stopped and \nperformed some new and unexpected steps. \nWhen at last, smartly whirling his partner \nround in front of her chair, he drew up with a \nclick of his spurs and bowed to her, Natasha \ndid not even make him a curtsy. She fixed her \neyes on him in amazement, smiling as if she \ndid not recognize him. \n\n"What does this mean?" she brought out. \n\nAlthough logel did not acknowledge this to \nbe the real mazurka, everyone was delighted \nwith Denfsov's skill, he was asked again and \nagain as a partner, and the old men began smil- \ningly to talk about Poland and the good old \ndays. Denfsov, flushed after the mazurka and \nmopping himself with his handkerchief, sat \n\n\n\ni88 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\ndown by Natdsha and did not leave her for the \nrest of the evening. \n\nCHAPTER XIII \n\nFOR TWO DAYS after that Rost6v did not see \nD61okhov at his own or at D61okhov's home: \non the third day he received a note from him: \n\nAs I do not intend to be at your house again for \nreasons you know of, and am going to rejoin my \nregiment, I am giving a farewell supper tonight to \nmy friendscome to the English Hotel. \n\nAbout ten o'clock Rost6v went to the English \nHotel straight from the theater, where he had \nbeen with his family and Denisov. He was at \nonce shown to the best room, which D61okhov \nhad taken for that evening. Some twenty men \nwere gathered round a table at which D61ok- \nhov sat between two candles. On the table was \na pile of gold and paper money, and he was \nkeeping the bank. Rost6v had not seen him \nsince his proposal and S6nya's refusal and felt \nuncomfortable at the thought of how they \nwould meet. \n\nD61okhov's clear, cold glance met Rost6v as \nsoon as he entered the door, as though he had \nlong expected him. \n\n"It's a long time since we met," he said. \n"Thanks for coming. I'll just finish dealing, \nand then Ilyiishka will come with his chorus." \n\n"I called once or twice at your house," said \nRost6v, reddening. \n\nD61okhov made no reply. \n\n"You may punt," he said. \n\nRost6v recalled at that moment a strange \nconversation he had once had with D61okhov. \n"None but fools trust to luck in play," D61ok- \nhov had then said. \n\n"Or are you afraid to play with me?" D61ok- \nhov now asked as if guessing Rost6v's thought. \n\nBeneath his smile Rostov saw in him the \nmood he had shown at the Club dinner and at \nother times, when as if tired of everyday life he \nhad felt a need to escape from it by some \nstrange, and usually cruel, action. \n\nRost6v felt ill at ease. He tried, but failed, \nto find some joke with which to reply to D61ok- \nhov's words. But before he had thought of any- \nthing, D61okhov, looking straight in his face, \nsaid slowly and deliberately so that everyone \ncould hear: \n\n"Do you remember we had a talk about cards \n. . . 'He's a fool who trusts to luck, one should \nmake certain/ and I want to try." \n\n"To try his luck or the certainty?" Rostov \nasked himself. \n\n\n\n"Well, you'd better not play," D61okhov \nadded, and springing a new pack of cards said: \n"Bank, gentlemen!" \n\nMoving the money forward he prepared to \ndeal. Rost6v sat down by hi side and at first \ndid not play. D61okhov kept glancing at him. \n\n"Why don't you play?" he asked. \n\nAnd strange to say Nicholas felt that he \ncould not help taking up a card, putting a \nsmall stake on it, and beginning to play. \n\n"I have no money with me," he said. \n\n"I'll trust you." \n\nRost6v staked five rubles on a card and lost, \nstaked again, and again lost. D61okhov "killed," \nthat is, beat, ten cards of Rost6v's running. \n\n"Gentlemen," said Dolokhov after he had \ndealt for some time. "Please place your money \non the cards or I may get muddled in the reck- \noning." \n\nOne of the players said he hoped he might \nbe trusted. \n\n"Yes, you might, but I am afraid of getting \nthe accounts mixed. So I ask you to put the \nmoney on your cards," replied D61okhov. \n"Don't stint yourself, we'll settle afterwards," \nhe added, turning to Rost6v. \n\nThe game continued; a waiter kept handing \nround champagne. \n\nAll Rost6v's cards were beaten and he had \neight hundred rubles scored up against him. \nHe wrote "800 rubles" on a card, but while \nthe waiter filled his glass he changed his mind \nand altered it to his usual stake of twenty \nrubles. \n\n"Leave it," said Dolokhov, though he did \nnot seem to be even looking at Rostov, "you'll \nwin it back all the sooner. I lose to the others \nbut win from you. Or are you afraid of me?" \nhe asked again. \n\nRost6v submitted. He let the eight hundred \nremain and laid down a seven of hearts with a \ntorn corner, which he had picked up from the \nfloor. He well remembered that seven after- \nwards. He laid down the seven of hearts, on \nwhich with a broken bit of chalk he had writ- \nten "800 rubles" in clear upright figures; he \nemptied the glass of warm champagne that was \nhanded him, smiled at D61okhov's words, and \nwith a sinking heart, waiting for a seven to \nturn up, gazed at D61okhov's hands which held \nthe pack. Much depended on Rost6v's win- \nning or losing on that seven of hearts. On the \nprevious Sunday the old count had given his \nson two thousand rubles, and though he al- \nways disliked speaking of money difficulties \nhad told Nicholas that this was all he could let \n\n\n\nBOOK \n\nhim have till May, and asked him to be more \neconomical this time. Nicholas had replied \nthat it would be more than enough for him \nand that he gave his word of honor not to take \nanything more till the spring. Now only twelve \nhundred rubles was left of that money, so that \nthis seven of hearts meant for him not only the \nloss of sixteen hundred rubles, but the neces- \nsity of going back on his word. With a sinking \nheart he watched D61okhov's hands and \nthought, "Now then, make haste and let me \nhave this card and I'll take my cap and drive \nhome to supper with Denfsov, Natdsha, and \nS6nya, and will certainly never touch a card \nagain." At that moment his home life, jokes \nwith Ptya, talks with S6nya, duets with Natd- \nsha, piquet with his father, and even his com- \nfortable bed in the house on the Povarskaya \nrose before him with such vividness, clearness, \nand charm that it seemed as if it were all a lost \nand unappreciated bliss, long past. He could \nnot conceive that a stupid chance, letting the \nseven be dealt to the right rather than to the \nleft, might deprive him of all this happiness, \nnewly appreciated and newly illumined, and \nplunge him into the depths of unknown and \nundefined misery. That could not be, yet he* \nawaited with a sinking heart the movement of \nD61okhov's hands. Those broad, reddish hands, \nwith hairy wrists visible from under the shirt \ncuffs, laid down the pack and took up a glass \nand a pipe that were handed him. \n\n"So you are not afraid to play with me?" re- \npeated D61okhov, and as if about to tell a good \nstory he put down the cards, leaned back in his \nchair, and began deliberately with a smile: \n\n"Yes, gentlemen, I've been told there's a ru- \nmor going about Moscow that I'm a sharper, \nso I advise you to be careful." \n\n"Come now, deal I" exclaimed Rost6v. \n\n"Oh, those Moscow gossips!" said D61okhov, \nand he took up the cards with a smile. \n\n"Aah!" Rost6v almost screamed lifting both \nhands to his head. The seven he needed was ly- \ning uppermost, the first card in the pack. He \nhad lost more than he could pay. \n\n"Still, don't ruin yourself 1" said D61okhov \nwith a side glance at Rost6v as he continued to \ndeal. \n\nCHAPTER XIV \n\nAN HOUR and a half later most of the players \nwere but little interested in their own play. \n\nThe whole interestwas concentrated on Ros- \nt6v. Instead of sixteen hundred rubles he had \na long column of figures scored against him, \n\n\n\nFOUR 189 \n\nwhich he had reckoned up to ten thousand, \nbut that now, as he vaguely supposed, must \nhave risen to fifteen thousand. In reality it al- \nready exceeded twenty thousand rubles. D6- \nlokhov was no longer listening to stories or \ntelling them, but followed every movement of \nRostov's hands and occasionally ran his eyes \nover the score against him. He had decided to \nplay until that score reached forty-three thou- \nsand. He had fixed on that number because \nforty-three was the sum of his and S6nya's joint \nages. Rost6v, leaning his head on both hands, \nsat at the table which was scrawled over with \nfigures, wet with spilled wine, and littered with \ncards. One tormenting impression did not leave \nhim: that those broad- boned reddish hands \nwith hairy wrists visible from under the shirt \nsleeves, those hands which he loved and hated, \nheld him in their power. \n\n"Six hundred rubles, ace, a corner, a nine \n. . . winning it back's impossible . . . Oh, how \npleasant it was at home I . . . The knave, double \nor quits ... it can't bel . . . And why is he doing \nthis to me?" Rostov pondered. Sometimes he \nstaked a large sum, but Drilokhov refused to \naccept it and fixed the stake himself. Nicholas \nsubmitted to him, and at one moment prayed \nto God as he had done on the battlefield at the \nbridge over the Enns, and then guessed that \nthe card that came first to hand from the crum- \npled heap under the table would save him, \nnow counted the cords on his coat and took a \ncard with that number and tried staking the \ntotal of his losses on it, then he looked round \nfor aid from the other players, or peered at the \nnow cold face of D61okhov and tried to read \nwhat was passing in his mind. \n\n"He knows of course what this loss means to \nme. He can't want my ruin. Wasn't he my \nfriend? Wasn't I fond of him? But it's not his \nfault. What's he to do if he has such luck? . . . \nAnd it's not my fault either," he thought to \nhimself, "I have done nothing wrong. Have I \nkilled anyone, or insulted or wished harm to \nanyone? Why such a terrible misfortune? And \nwhen did it begin? Such a little while ago 1 \ncame to this table with the thought of winning \na hundred rubles to buy that casket for Mam- \nma's name day and then going home. I was so \nhappy, so free, so lightheartedl And I did not \nrealize how happy I was! When did that end \nand when did this new, terrible state of things \nbegin? What marked the change? I sat all the \ntime in this same place at this table, chose and \nplaced cards, and watched those broad-boned \nagile hands in the same way. When did it hap- \n\n\n\nigo \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\npen and what has happened? I am well and \nstrong and still the same and in the same place. \nNo, it can't be! Surely it will all end in noth- \ning!" \n\nHe was flushed and bathed in perspiration, \nthough the room was not hot. His face was ter- \nrible and piteous to see, especially from its \nhelpless efforts to seem calm. \n\nThe score against him reached the fateful \nsum of forty-three thousand. Rost6v had just \nprepared a card, by bending the corner of \nwhich he meant to double the three thousand \njust put down to his score, when D61okhov, \nslamming down the pack of cards, put it aside \nand began rapidly adding up the total of Ros- \nt6v's debt, breaking the chalk as he marked the \nfigures in his clear, bold hand. \n\n"Supper, it's time for supper! And here are \nthe gypsies!" \n\nSome swarthy men and women were really \nentering from the cold outside and saying some- \nthing in their gypsy accents. Nicholas under- \nstood that it was all over; but he said in an in- \ndifferent tone: \n\n"Well, won't you go on? I had a splendid \ncard all ready," as if it were the fun of the \ngame which interested him most. \n\n"It's all up! I'm lost!" thought he. "Now a \nbullet through my brainthat's all that's left \nme!" And at the same time he said in a cheer- \nful voice: \n\n"Come now, just this one more little card!" \n\n"All right!" said D61okhov, having finished \nthe addition. "All right! Twenty-one rubles," \nhe said, pointing to the figure twenty-one by \nwhich the total exceeded the round sum of \nforty-three thousand; and taking up a pack he \nprepared to deal. Rost6v submissively unbent \nthe corner of his card and, instead of the six \nthousand he had intended, carefully wrote \ntwenty-one. \n\n"It's all the same to me," he said. "I only \nwant to see whether you will let me win this \nten, or beat it." \n\nD61okhov began to deal seriously. Oh, how \nRost6v detested at that moment those hands \nwith their short reddish fingers and hairy \nwrists, which held him in their power. . . . The \nten fell to him. \n\n"You owe forty-three thousand, Count," said \nD61okhov, and stretching himself he rose from \nthe table. "One does get tired sitting so long," \nhe added. \n\n"Yes, I'm tired too," said Rost6v. \n\nD61okhov cut him short, as if to remind him \nthat it was not for him to jest. \n\n\n\n"When am I to receive the money, Count?" \n\nRost6v, flushing, drew D61okhov into the \nnext room. \n\n"I cannot pay it all immediately. Will you \ntake an I.O.U.?" he said. \n\n"I say, Rost6v," said D61okhov clearly, smil- \ning and looking Nicholas straight in the eyes, \n"you know the saying, 'Lucky in love, unlucky \nat cards.' Your cousin is in love with you, I \nknow." \n\n"Oh, it's terrible to feel oneself so in this \nman's power," thought Rost6v. He knew what \na shock he would inflict on his father and \nmother by the news of this loss, he knew what \na relief it would be to escape it all, and felt \nthat Dolokhov knew that he could save him \nfrom all this shame and sorrow, but wanted \nnow to play with him as a cat does with a \nmouse. \n\n"Your cousin . . ." D61okhov started to say, \nbut Nicholas interrupted him. \n\n"My cousin has nothing to do with this and \nit's not necessary to mention her!" he ex- \nclaimed fiercely. \n\n"Then when am I to have it?" \n\n"Tomorrow," replied Rost6v and left the \n'room. \n\nCHAPTER XV \n\nTo SAY "tomorrow" and keep up a dignified \ntone was not difficult, but to go home alone, \nsee his sisters, brother, mother, and father, con- \nfess and ask for money he had no right to after \ngiving his word of honor, was terrible. \n\nAt home, they had not yet gone to bed. The \nyoung people, after returning from the theater, \nhad had supper and were grouped round the \nclavichord. As soon as Nicholas entered, he \nwas enfolded in that poetic atmosphere of love \nwhich pervaded the Rost6v household that \nwinter and, now after D61okhov's proposal and \nlogel's ball, seemed to have grown thicker \nround S6nya and Natdsha as the air does be- \nfore a thunderstorm. S6nya and Natasha, in \nthe light-blue dresses they had worn at the \ntheater, looking pretty and conscious of it, \nwere standing by the clavichord, happy and \nsmiling. Vera was playing chess with Shinshin \nin the drawing room. The old countess, wait- \ning for the return of her husband and son, sat \nplaying patience with the old gentlewoman \nwho lived in their house. Denfsov, with spar- \nkling eyes and ruffled hair, sat at the clavichord \nstriking chords with his short fingers, his legs \nthrown back and his eyes rolling as he sang, \nwith his small, husky, but true voice, some \n\n\n\nBOOK FOUR \n\n\n\nverses called "Enchantress," which he had com- \nposed, and to which he was trying to fit music: \n\nEnchantress, say, to my forsaken lyre \nWhat magic power is this recalls me still? \nWhat spark has set my inmost soul on fire, \nWhat is this bliss that makes my fingers thrill? \n\nHe was singing in passionate tones, gazing with \nhis sparkling black-agate eyes at the frightened \nand happy Natdsha. \n\n"Splendid! Excellent!" exclaimed Natdsha. \n"Another verse," she said, without noticing \nNicholas. \n\n"Everything's still the same with them," \nthought Nicholas, glancing into the drawing \nroom, where he saw Vra and his mother with \nthe old lady. \n\n"Ah, and here's Nicholas!" cried Natdsha, \nrunning up to him. \n\n"Is Papa at home?" he asked. \n\n"I am so glad you've come!" said Natdsha, \nwithout answering him. "We are en joying our- \nselves! Vasfli Dmftrich is staying a day longer \nfor my sake! Did you know?" \n\n"No, Papa is not back yet," said S6nya. \n\n"Nicholas, have you come? Come here, \ndear!" called the old countess from the draw- \ning room. \n\nNicholas went to her, kissed her hand, and \nsitting down silently at her table began to \nwatch her hands arranging the cards. From the \ndancing room, they still heard the laughter \nand merry voices trying to persuade Natdsha to \nsing. \n\n"All wight! All wight!" shouted Denfsov. \n"It's no good making excuses now! It's your \nturn to sing the ba'cawolla I entweat you!" \n\nThe countess glanced at her silent son. \n\n"What is the matter?" she asked. \n\n"Oh, nothing," said he, as if weary of being \ncontinually asked the same question. "Will \nPapa be back soon?" \n\n"I expect so." \n\n"Everything's the same with them. They \nknow nothing about it! Where am I to go?" \nthought Nicholas, and went again into the \ndancing room where the clavichord stood. \n\nS6nya was sitting at the clavichord, playing \nthe prelude to Denfsov's favorite barcarolle. \nNatdsha was preparing to sing. Denfsov was \nlooking at her with enraptured eyes. \n\nNicholas began pacing up and down the \nroom. \n\n"Why do they want to make her sing? How \ncan she sing? There's nothing to be happy \nabout I " thought he. \n\n\n\nS6nya struck the first chord of the prelude. \n\n"My God, I'm a ruined and dishonored man! \nA bullet through my brain is the only thing \nleft me not singing!" his thoughts ran on. "Go \naway? But where to? It's all one let them sing!" \n\nHe continued to pace the room, looking \ngloomily at Denfsov and the girls and avoiding \ntheir eyes. \n\n"Nik61enka, what is the matter?" S6nya's \neyes fixed on him seemed to ask. She noticed at \nonce that something had happened to him. \n\nNicholas turned away from her. Natdsha too, \nwith her quick instinct, had instantly noticed \nher brother's condition. But, though she no- \nticed it, she was herself in such high spirits at \nthat moment, so far from sorrow, sadness, or \nself-reproach, that she purposely deceived her- \nself as young people of ten do." No, I am too hap- \npy now to spoil my enjoyment by sympathy with \nanyone's sorrow," she felt, and she said to her- \nself: "No, I must be mistaken, he must be feel- \ning happy, just as I am." \n\n"Now, Sonya!" she said, going to the very \nmiddle of the room, where she considered the \nresonance was best. \n\nHaving lifted her head and let her arms \ndroop lifelessly, as ballet dancers do, Natdsha, \nrising energetically from her heels to her toes, \nstepped to the middle of the room and stood \nstill. \n\n"Yes, that's me!"sheseemed to say, answering \nthe rapt gaze with which Denfsov followed her. \n\n"And what is she so pleased about?" thought \nNicholas, looking at his sister. "Why isn't she \ndull and ashamed?" \n\nNatdsha took the first note, her throat \nswelled, her chest rose, her eyes became serious. \nAt that moment she was oblivious of her sur- \nroundings, and from her smiling lips flowed \nsounds which anyone may produce at the same \nintervals and hold for the same time, but which \nleave you cold a thousand times and the thou- \nsand and first time thrill you and make you \nweep. \n\nNatdsha, that winter, had for the first time \nbegun to sing seriously, mainly because Den- \nfsov so delighted in her singing. She no longer \nsang as a child, there was no longer in her sing- \ning that comical, childish, painstaking effect \nthat had been in it before; but she did not yet \nsing well, as all the connoisseurs who heard her \nsaid: "It is not trained, but it is a beautiful \nvoice that must be trained." Only they gener- \nally said this some time after she had finished \nsinging. While that untrained voice, with its \nincorrect breathing and labored transitions, \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nwas sounding, even the connoisseurs said noth- \ning, but only delighted in it and wished to hear \nit again. In her voice there was a virginal \nfreshness, an unconsciousness of her own pow- \ners, and an as yet untrained velvety softness, \nwhich so mingled with her lack of art in sing- \ning that it seemed as if nothing in that voice \ncould be altered without spoiling it. \n\n"What is this?" thought Nicholas, listening \nto her with widely opened eyes. "What has \nhappened to her? How she is singing today 1" \nAnd suddenly the whole world centered for \nhim on anticipation of the next note, the next \nphrase, and everything in the world was di- \nvided into three beats: "Oh mio crudelc affet- \nto" . . . One, two, three . . . one, two, three . . . \nOne . . . "Oh mio crudele affetto." . . . One, \ntwo, three . . . One. "Oh, this senseless life of \nours!" thought Nicholas. "All this misery, and \nmoney, and D61okhov, and anger, and honor \nit's all nonsense . . . but this is real. . . . Now \nthen, Natdsha, now then, dearest! Now then, \ndarling! How will she take that si? She's taken \nit! Thank God!" And without noticing that he \nwas singing, to strengthen the si he sung a \nsecond, a third below the high note. "Ah, God! \nHow fine! Did I really take it? How fortunate!" \nhe thought. \n\nOh, how that chord vibrated, and how moved \nwas something that was finest in Rostov's soul! \nAnd this something was apart from everything \nelse in the world and above everything in the \nworld. "What were losses, and D61okhov, and \nwords of honor? . . . All nonsense! One might \nkill and rob and yet be happy " \n\nCHAPTER XVI \n\nIT WAS LONG since Rost6v had felt such enjoy- \nment from music as he did that day. But no \nsooner had Natdsha finished her barcarolle \nthan reality again presented itself. He got up \nwithout saying a word and went downstairs to \nhis own room. A quarter of an hour later the \nold count came in from his Club, cheerful and \ncontented. Nicholas, hearing him drive up, \nwent to meet him. \n\n"Well had a good time?" said the old count, \nsmiling gaily and proudly at his son. \n\nNicholas tried to say "Yes," but could not: \nand he nearly burst into sobs. The count was \nlighting his pipe and did not notice his son's \ncondition. \n\n"Ah, it can't be avoided!" thought Nicholas, \nfor the first and last time. And suddenly, in the \nmost casual tone, which made him feel ashamed \nof himself, he said, as if merely asking his fa- \n\n\n\nther to let him have the carriage to drive to \ntown: \n\n"Papa, I have come on a matter of business. \nI was nearly forgetting. I need some money." \n\n"Dear me!" said his father, who was in a spe- \ncially good humor. "I told you it would not be \nenough. How much?" \n\n"Very much," said Nicholas flushing, and \nwith a stupid careless smile, for which he was \nlong unable to forgive himself, "I have lost a \nlittle, I mean a good deal, a great deal forty- \nthree thousand." \n\n"What! To whom? . . . Nonsense!" cried the \ncount, suddenly reddening with an apoplectic \nflush over neck and nape as old people do. \n\n"I promised to pay tomorrow," said Nicho- \nlas. \n\n"Well! . . ."said the old count, spreading out \nhis arms and sinking helplessly on the sofa. \n\n"It can't behelped! It happens toeveryone!" \nsaid the son, with a bold, free, and easy tone, \nwhile in his soul he regarded himself as a \nworthless scoundrel whose whole life could not \natone for his crime. He longed to kiss his fa- \nther's hands and kneel to beg his forgiveness, \nbut said, in a careless and even rude voice, that \nit happens to everyone! \n\nThe old count cast down his eyes on hearing \nhis son's words and began bustlingly searching \nfor something. \n\n"Yes, yes," he muttered, "it will be difficult, \nI fear, difficult to raise . . . happens to every- \nbody! Yes, who has not done it?" \n\nAnd with a furtive glance at his son's face, \nthe count went out of the room. . . . Nicholas \nhad been prepared for resistance, but had not \nat all expected this. \n\n"Papa! Pa-pa!" he called after him, sobbing, \n"forgive me!" And seizing his father's hand, he \npressed it to his lips and burst into tears. \n\nWhile father and son were having their ex- \nplanation, the mother and daughter were hav- \ning one not less important. Natdsha came run- \nning to her mother, quite excited. , \n\n"Mamma! . . . Mamma! . . . He has made \nme . . ." \n\n"Made what?" \n\n"Made, made me an offer, Mamma! Mam- \nma!" she exclaimed. \n\nThe countess did not believe her ears. Den- \nisov had proposed. To whom? To this chit of a \ngirl, Natasha, who not so long ago was playing \nwith dolls and who was still having lessons. \n\n"Don't, Natdsha! What nonsense!" she said, \nhoping it was a joke. \n\n"Nonsense, indeed! lamtellingyou the fact," \n\n\n\nBOOK \n\nsaid Natasha indignantly. "I come to ask you \nwhat to do, and you call it 'nonsense!' " \n\nThe countess shrugged her shoulders. \n\n"If it is true that Monsieur Denfsov has made \nyou a proposal, tell him he is a fool, that's all I" \n\n"No, he's not a fool!" replied Natasha indig- \nnantly and seriously. \n\n"Well then, what do you want? You're all in \nlove nowadays. Well, if you are in love, mar- \nry him!" said the countess, with a laugh of an- \nnoyance. "Good luck to you!" \n\n"No, Mamma, I'm not in love with him, I \nsuppose I'm not in love with him." \n\n"Well then, tell him so." \n\n"Mamma, are you cross? Don't be cross, dear! \nIs it my fault?" \n\n"No, but what is it, my dear? Do you want \nme to go and tell him?" said the countess smil- \ning. \n\n"No, I will do it myself, only tell me what to \nsay. It's all very well for you," said Natdsha, \nwith a responsive smile. "You should have seen \nhow he said it! I know he did not mean to say \nit, but it came out accidently." \n\n"Well, all the same, you must refuse him." \n\n"No, I mustn't. I am so sorry for him! He's \nso nice." \n\n"Well then, accept his offer. It's high time \nfor you to be married," answered the countess \nsharply and sarcastically. \n\n"No, Mamma, but I'm so sorry for him. I \ndon't know how I'm to say it." \n\n"And there's nothing for you to say. I shall \nspeak to him myself," said the countess, indig- \nnant that they should have dared to treat this \nlittle Natdsha as grown up. \n\n"No, not on any account! I will tell him my- \nself, and you'll listen at the door," and Natasha \nran across the drawing room to the dancing \nhall, where Denfsov was sitting on the same \nchair by the clavichord with his face in his \nhands. \n\nHe jumped up at the sound of her light step. \n\n"Nataly," he said, moving with rapid steps \ntoward her, "decide my fate. It is in your hands." \n\n"Vasfli Dmitrich, I'm so sorry for you! . . . \nNo, but you are so nice . . . but it won't do ... \nnot that . . . but as a friend, I shall always love \nyou." \n\n\n\nFOUR 193 \n\nDenlsov bent over her hand and she heard \nstrange sounds she did not understand. She \nkissed his rough curly black head. At this in- \nstant, they heard the quick rustle of the count- \ness' dress. She came up to them. \n\n"Vasfli Dmitrich, I thankyou for the honor," \nshe said, with an embarrassed voice, though it \nsounded severe to Denlsov "but my daughter \nis so young, and I thought that, as my son's \nfriend, you would have addressed yourself \nfirst to me. In that case you would not have \nobliged me to give this refusal." \n\n"Countess . . ." said Denfsov, with downcast \neyes and a guilty face. He tried to say more, but \nfaltered. \n\nNatasha could not remain calm, seeing him \nin such a plight. She began to sob aloud. \n\n"Countess, I have done w'ong," Denfsov \nwent on in an unsteady voice, "but believe me, \nI so adore your daughter and all your family \nthat I would give my life twice over . . ." He \nlooked at the countess, and seeing her severe \nface said: "Well, good-by, Countess," and kiss- \ning her hand, he left the room with quick reso- \nlute strides, without looking at Natasha. \n\nNext day Rost6vsaw Denfsov off. He did not \nwish to stay another day in Moscow. All Denf- \nsov's Moscow friends gave him a farewell en- \ntertainment at the gypsies', with the result that \nhe had no recollection of how he was put in the \nsleigh or of the first three stages of his journey. \n\nAfter Denfsov's departure, Rost6v spent an- \nother fortnight in Moscow, without going out \nof the house, waiting for the money his father \ncould not at once raise, and he spent most of \nhis time in the girls' room. \n\nS6nya was more tender and devoted to him \nthan ever. It was as if she wanted to show him \nthat his losses were an achievement that made \nher love him all the more, but Nicholas now \nconsidered himself unworthy of her. \n\nHe filled the girls' albums with verses and \nmusic, and having at last sent D61okhov the \nwhole forty-three thousand rubles and received \nhis receipt, he left at the end of November, \nwithout taking leave of any of his acquaint- \nances, to overtake his regiment which was al- \nready in Poland. \n\n\n\nBook Five: 1806-07 \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I \n\nAFTER HIS INTERVIEW with his wife Pierre left \nfor Petersburg. At the Torzh6k post station, \neither there were no horses or the postmaster \nwould not supply them. Pierre was obliged to \nwait. Without undressing, he lay down on the \nleather sofa in front of a round table, put his \nbig feet in their overboots on the table, and \nbegan to reflect. \n\n"Will you have the portmanteaus brought in? \nAnd a bed got ready, and tea?" asked his valet. \n\nPierre gave no answer, for he neither heard \nnor saw anything. He had begun to think of \nthe last station and was still pondering on the \nsame question one so important that he took \nno notice of what went on around him. Not \nonly was he indifferent as to whether he got to \nPetersburg earlier or later, or whether he se- \ncured accommodation at this station, but com- \npared to the thoughts that now occupied him \nit was a matter of indifference whether he re- \nmained there for a few hours or for the rest of \nhis life. \n\nThe postmaster, his wife, the valet, and a \npeasant woman selling Torzh6k embroidery \ncame into the room offering their services. \nWithout changing his careless attitude, Pierre \nlooked at them over his spectacles unable to \nunderstand what they wanted or how they \ncould go on living without having solved the \nproblems that so absorbed him. He had been \nengrossed by the same thoughts ever since the \nday he returned from Sok61niki after the duel \nand had spent that first agonizing, sleepless \nnight. But now, in the solitude of the journey, \nthey seized him with special force. No matter \nwhat he thought about, he always returned to \nthese same questions which he could not solve \nand yet could not cease to ask himself. It was \nas if the thread of the chief screw which held \nhis life together were stripped, so that thescrew \ncould not get in or out, but went on turning \nuselessly in the same place. \n\nThe postmaster came in and began obse- \nquiously to beg his excellency to wait only two \n\n\n\nhours, when, come what might, he would let \nhis excellency have the courier horses. It was \nplain that he was lying and only wanted to get \nmore money from the traveler. \n\n"Is this good or bad?" Pierre asked himself. \n"It is good for me, bad for another traveler, \nand for himself it's unavoidable, because he \nneeds money for food; the man said an officer \nhad once given him a thrashing for letting a \nprivate traveler have the courier horses. But \nthe officer thrashed him because he had to get \non as quickly as possible. And I," continued \nPierre, "shot Dolokhov because I considered \nmyself injured, and Louis XVI was executed \nbecause they considered him a criminal, and a \nyear later they executed those who executed \nhim also for some reason. What is bad? What \nis good? What should one love and what hate? \nWhat does one live for? And what am I? What \nis life, and what is death? What power governs \nall?" \n\nThere was no answer to any of these ques- \ntions, except one, and that not a logical answer \nand not at all a reply to them. The answer was: \n"You'll die and all will end. You'll die and \nknow all, or cease asking." But dying was also \ndreadful. \n\nThe Torzh6k peddler woman, in a whining \nvoice, went on offering her wares, especially a \npair of goatskin slippers. "I have hundreds of \nrubles I don't know what to do with, and she \nstands in her tattered cloak looking timidly at \nme," he thought. "And what does she want the \nmoney for? As if that money could add a hair's \nbreadth to her happiness or peaceof mind. Can \nanything in the world make her or me less a \nprey to evil and death? death which ends all \nand must come today or tomorrow at any rate, \nin an instant as compared with eternity." And \nagain he twisted the screw with the stripped \nthread, and again it turned uselessly in the \nsame place. \n\nHis servant handed him a half-cut novel, in \nthe form of letters, by Madame de Souza. He \nbegan reading about the sufferings and virtu- \n\n\n\n'94 \n\n\n\nBOOK FIVE \n\n\n\n195 \n\n\n\n&gt;us struggles of a certain Emilie de Mansfeld. \n'And why did she resist her seducer when she \nioved him?" he thought. "God could not have \nput into her heart an impulse that was against \nHis will. My wife as she once was did not \nitruggle, and perhaps she was right. Nothing \nhas been found out, nothing discovered," \nPierre again said to himself. "All we can know \nis that we know nothing. And that's the height \n-&gt;f human wisdom." \n\nEverything within and around him seemed \n:on fused, senseless, and repellent. Yet in this \nvery repugnance to all his circumstances Pierre \nfound a kind of tantalizing satisfaction. \n\n"I make bold to ask your excellency to move \n\ little for this gentleman," said the postmaster, \nentering the room followed by another travel- \ner, also detained for lack of horses. \n\nThe newcomer was a short, large-boned, yel- \nlow-faced, wrinkled old man, with gray bushy \neyebrows overhanging bright eyes of an indefi- \nnite grayish color. \n\nPierre took his feet off the table, stood up, \nand lay down on a bed that had been got ready \nfor him, glancing now and then at the newcom- \ner, who, with a gloomy and tired face, was \nwearily taking off his wraps with the aid of his \nservant, and not looking at Pierre. With a pair \nof felt boots on his thin bony legs, and keep- \ning on a worn, nankeen-covered, sheepskin \ncoat, the traveler sat down on the sofa, leaned \nback his big head with its broad temples and \nclose-cropped hair, and looked at Beziikhov. \nThe stern, shrewd, and penetrating expression \nof that look struck Pierre. He felt a wish to \nspeak to the stranger, but by the time he had \nmade up his mind to ask him a question about \nthe roads, the traveler had closed his eyes. His \nshriveled old hands were folded and on the \nfinger of one of them Pierre noticed a large cast- \niron ring with a seal representing a death's- \nhead. The stranger sat without stirring, either \nresting or, as it seemed to Pierre, sunk in pro- \nfound and calm meditation. His servant was \nalso a yellow, wrinkled old man, without beard \nor mustache, evidently not because he was shav- \nen but because they had never grown. This ac- \ntive old servant was unpacking the traveler's \ncanteen and preparing tea. He brought in a \nboiling samovar. When everything was ready, \nthe stranger opened his eyes, moved to the \ntable, filled a tumbler with tea for himself and \none for the beardless old man to whom he \npassed it. Pierre began to feel a sense of un- \neasiness, and the need, even the inevitability, of \nentering into conversation with this stranger. \n\n\n\nThe servant brought back his tumbler turned \nupside down, 1 with an unfinished bit of nib- \nbled sugar, and asked if anything more would \nbe wanted. \n\n"No. Give me the book," said the stranger. \n\nThe servant handed him a book which \nPierre took to be a devotional work, and the \ntraveler became absorbed in it. Pierre looked \nat him. All at once the stranger closed the book, \nputting in a marker, and again, leaning with \nhis arms on the back of the sofa, sat in his \nformer position with his eyes shut. Pierre looked \nat him and had not time to turn away when the \nold man, opening his eyes, fixed his steady and \nsevere gaze straight on Pierre's face. \n\nPierre felt confused and wished to avoid that \nlook, but the bright old eyes attracted him ir- \nresistibly. \n\nCHAPTER II \n\n"I HAVE THE PLEASURE of addressing Count Be- \nziikhov, if I am not mistaken," said the stran- \nger in a deliberate and loud voice. \n\nPierre looked silently and inquiringly at him \nover his spectacles. \n\n"I have heard of you, my dear sir," continued \nthe stranger, "and of your misfortune." He \nseemed to emphasize the last word, as if to say \n"Yes, misfortune! Call it what you please, I \nknow that what happened to you in Moscow \nwas a misfortune." "I regret it very much, my \ndear sir." \n\nPierre flushed and, hurriedly putting his legs \ndown from the bed, bent forward toward the \nold man with a forced and timid smile. \n\n"I have not referred to this out of curiosity, \nmy dear sir, but for greater reasons." \n\nHe paused, his gaze still on Pierre, and moved \naside on the sofa by way of inviting the other \nto take a seat beside him. Pierre felt reluctant \nto enter into conversation with this old man, \nbut, submitting to him involuntarily, came up \nand sat down beside him. \n\n"You are unhappy, my dear sir," the stranger \ncontinued. "You are young and I am old. I \nshould like to help you as far as lies in my \npower." \n\n"Oh, yes!" said Pierre, with a forced smile. \n"I am very grateful to you. Where are you trav- \neling from?" \n\nThe stranger's face was not genial, it was \neven cold and severe, but in spite of this, both \nthe face and words of his new acquaintance \nwere irresistibly attractive to Pierre. \n\n"But if for any reason you don't feel inclined \n\n1 To indicate he did not want more tea. \n\n\n\nig6 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nto talk to me," said the old man, "say so, my \ndear sir." And he suddenly smiled, in an un- \nexpected and tenderly paternal way, \n\n"Oh no, not at all! On the contrary, I am \nvery glad to make your acquaintance," said \nPierre. And again, glancing at the stranger's \nhands, he looked more closely at the ring, with \nits skulla Masonic sign. \n\n"Allow me to ask," he said, "are you a Ma- \nson?" \n\n"Yes, I belong to the Brotherhood of the \nFreemasons," said the stranger, looking deep- \ner and deeper into Pierre's eyes. "And in their \nname and my own I hold out a brotherly hand \nto you." \n\n"I am afraid," said Pierre, smiling, and wa- \nvering between the confidence the personality \nof the Freemason inspired in him and his own \nhabit of ridiculing the Masonic beliefs "I am \nafraid I am very far from understanding how \nam I to put it? I am afraid my way of looking \nat the world is so*opposed to yours that we \nshall not understand one another." \n\n"I knowyour outlook," said the Mason, "and \nthe view of life you mention, and which you \nthink is the result of your own mental efforts, \nis the one held by the majority of people, and \nis the invariable fruit of pride, indolence, and \nignorance. Forgive me, my dear sir, but if I \nhad not known it I should not have addressed \nyou. Your view of life is a regrettable delusion." \n\n"Just as I may suppose you to be deluded," \nsaid Pierre, with a faint smile. \n\n"I should never dare to say that I know the \ntruth," said the Mason, whose words struck \nPierre more and more by their precision and \nfirmness. "No one can attain to truth by him- \nself. Only by laying stone on stone with the co- \noperation of all, by the millions of generations \nfrom our forefather Adam to our own times, is \nthat temple reared which is to be a worthy \ndwelling place of the Great God," he added, \nand closed his eyes. \n\n"I ought to tell you that I do not believe \n... do not believe in God," said Pierre, regret- \nfully and with an effort, feeling it essential to \nspeak the whole truth. \n\nThe Mason looked intently at Pierre and \nsmiled as a rich man with millions in hand \nmight smile at a poor fellow who told him that \nhe, poor man, had not the five rubles that \nwould make him happy. \n\n"Yes, you do not know Him, my dear sir," \nsaid the Mason. "You cannot know Him. You \ndo not know Him and that is why you are un- \nhappy." \n\n\n\n"Yes, yes, I am unhappy," assented Pierre. \n"But what am I to do?" \n\n"You know Him not, my dear sir, and so you \nare very unhappy. You do not know Him, but \nHe is here, He is in me, He is in my words, He \nis in thee,and even in those blasphemous words \nthou hast just uttered!" pronounced the Mason \nin a stern and tremulous voice. \n\nHe paused and sighed, evidently trying to \ncalm himself. \n\n"If He were not," he said quietly, "you and \nI would not be speaking of Him, my dear sir. \nOf what, of whom, are we speaking? Whom \nhast thou denied?" he suddenly asked with ex- \nulting austerity and authority in his voice. \n"Who invented Him, if He did not exist? \nWhence came thy conception of the existence \nof such an incomprehensible Being? Why didst \nthou, and why did the whole world, conceive \nthe idea of the existence of such an incompre- \nhensible Being, a Being all-powerful, eternal, \nand infinite in all His attributes? . . ." \n\nHe stopped and remained silent for a long \ntime. \n\nPierre could not and did not wish to break \nthis silence. \n\n"He exists, but to understand Him is hard," \nthe Mason began again, looking not at Pierre \nbut straight before him, and turning the leaves \nof his book with his old hands which from ex- \ncitement he could not keep still. "If it were a \nman whose existence thou didst doubt I could \nbring him to thee, could take him by the hand \nand show him to thee. But how can I, an insig- \nnificant mortal, show His omnipotence, His in- \nfinity, and all His mercy to one who is blind, \nor who shuts his eyes that he may not see or \nunderstand Him and may not see or under- \nstand his own vileness and sinfulness?" He \npaused again. "Who art thou? Thou dreamest \nthat thou art wise because thou couldst utter \nthose blasphemous words," he went on, with a \nsomber and scornful smile. "And thou art more \nfoolish and unreasonable than a little child, \nwho, playing with the parts of a skillfully made \nwatch, dares to say that, as he does not under- \nstand its use, he does not believe in the master \nwho made it. To know Him is hard. . . . For \nages, from our forefather Adam to our own \nday, we labor to attain that knowledge and are \nstill infinitely far from our aim; but in our \nlack of understanding we see only our weak- \nness and His greatness. . . ." \n\nPierre listened with swelling heart, gazing \ninto the Mason's face with shining eyes, not \ninterrupting or questioning him, but believ- \n\n\n\ning with his whole soul what the stranger said. \nWhether he accepted the wise reasoning con- \ntained in the Mason's words, or believed as a \nchild believes, in the speaker's tone of convic- \ntion and earnestness, or the tremor of the speak- \ner's voicewhich sometimes almost broke or \nthose brilliant aged eyes grown old in this con- \nviction, or the calm firmness and certainty of \nhis vocation, which radiated from his whole be- \ning (and which struck Pierre especially by con- \ntrast with his own dejection and hopelessness) \nat any rate, Pierre longed with his whole soul \nto believe and he did believe, and felt a joyful \nsense of comfort, regeneration, and return to \nlife. \n\n"He is not to be apprehended by reason, \nbut by life," said the Mason. \n\n"I do not understand," said Pierre, feeling \nwith dismay doubts reawakening. He was \nafraid of any want of clearness, any weakness, \nin the Mason's arguments; he dreaded not to \nbe able to believe in him. "I don't under- \nstand," he said, "how it is that the mind of \nman cannot attain the knowledge of which \nyou speak." \n\nThe Mason smiled with his gentle fatherly \nsmile. \n\n"The highest wisdom and truth are like the \npurest liquid we may wish to imbibe," he said. \n"Can I receive that pure liquid into an impure \nvessel and judge of its purity? Only by the in- \nner purification of myself can I retain in some \ndegree of purity the liquid I receive." \n\n"Yes, yes, that is so," said Pierre joyfully. \n\n"The highest wisdom is not founded on rea- \nson alone, not on those worldly sciences of phys- \nics, history, chemistry, and the like, into which \nintellectual knowledge is divided. The highest \nwisdom is one. The highest wisdom has but \none science the science of the whole the sci- \nence explaining the whole creation and man's \nplace in it. To receive that science it is neces- \nsary to purify and renew one's inner self, and \nso before one can know, it is necessary to be- \nlieve and to perfect one's self. And to attain \nthis end, we have the light called conscience \nthat God has implanted in our souls." \n\n"Yes, yes," assented Pierre. \n\n"Look then at thy inner self with the eyes of \nthe spirit, and ask thyself whether thou art con- \ntent with thyself. What -hast thou attained re- \nlying on reason only? What art thou? You are \nyoung, you are rich, you are clever, you are well \neducated. And what have you done with all \nthese good gifts? Are you content with yourself \nand with your life?" \n\n\n\nBOOK FIVE 197 \n\n"No, I hate my life," Pierre muttered, winc- \n\n\n\ning. \n\n"Thou hatest it. Then change it, purify thy- \nself; and as thou art purified, thou wilt gain \nwisdom. Look at your life, my dear sir. How \nhave you spent it? In riotous orgies and de- \nbauchery, receiving everything from society \nand giving nothing in return. You have be- \ncome the possessor of wealth. How have you \nused it? What have you done for your neigh- \nbor? Have you ever thought of your tens of \nthousands of slaves? Have you helped them \nphysically and morally? No! You have profited \nby their toil to lead a profligate life. That is \nwhat you have done. Have you chosen a post \nin which you might be of service to your neigh- \nbor? No! You have spent your life in idleness. \nThen you married, my dear sirtook on your- \nself responsibility for the guidance of a young \nwoman; and what have you done? You have \nnot helped her to find the way of truth, my \ndear sir, but have thrust her into an abyss of de- \nceit and misery. A man offended you and you \nshot him, and you say you do not know God \nand hate your life. There is nothing strange in \nthat, my dear sir!" \n\nAfter these words, the Mason, as if tired by \nhis long discourse, again leaned his arms on \nthe back of the sofa and closed his eyes. Pierre \nlooked at that aged, stern, motionless, almost \nlifeless face and moved his lips without utter- \ning a sound. He wished to say, "Yes, a vile, idle, \nvicious life!" but dared not break the silence. \n\nThe Mason cleared his throat huskily, as \nold men do, and called his servant. \n\n"How about the horses?" he asked, without \nlooking at Pierre. \n\n"The exchange horses have just come," an- \nswered the servant. "Will you not rest here?" \n\n"No, tell them to harness." \n\n"Can he really be going away and leaving me \nalone without having told me all, and without \npromising to help me?" thought Pierre, rising \nwith downcast head; and he began to pace the \nroom, glancing occasionally at the Mason. "Yes, \nI never thought of it, but I have led a con- \ntemptible and profligate life, though I did not \nlike it and did not want to," thought Pierre. \n"But this man knows the truth and, if he wished \nto, could disclose it to me." \n\nPierre wished to say this to the Mason, but \ndid not dare to. The traveler, having packed \nhis things with his practiced hands, began fas- \ntening his coat. When he had finished, he turned \nto Bezukhov, and said in a tone of indifferent \npoliteness: \n\n\n\n198 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\n"Where are you going to now, my dear sir?" \n\n"I? . . . I'm going to Petersburg/' answered \nPierre, in a childlike, hesitating voice. "I thank \nyou. I agree with all you have said. But do not \nsuppose me to be so bad. With my whole soul \nI wish to be what you would have me be, but \nI have never had help from anyone. . . . But it \nis I, above all, who am to blame for everything. \nHelp me, teach me, and perhaps I may . . ." \n\nPierre could not go on. He gulped and turn- \ned away. \n\nThe Mason remained silent for a long time, \nevidently considering. \n\n"Help comes from God alone," he said, "but \nsuch measure of help as our Order can bestow \nit will render you, my dear sir. You are going to \nPetersburg. Hand this to Count Willarski" (he \ntook out his notebook and wrote a few words \non a large sheet of paper folded in four). "Al- \nlow me to give you a piece of advice. When you \nreach the capital, first of all devote some time \nto solitude and self-examination and do not \nresume your former way of life. And now I \nwish you a good journey, my dear sir," he add- \ned, seeing that his servant had entered ". . . and \nsuccess." \n\nThe traveler was Joseph Alextfevich Bazd- \nev, as Pierre saw from the postmaster's book. \nBazde*ev had been one of the best-known Free- \nmasons and Martinists,even in Novfkov's time. \nFor a long while after he had gone, Pierre did \nnot go to bed or order horses but paced up and \ndown the room, pondering over his vicious \npast, and with a rapturous sense of beginning \nanew pictured to himself the blissful, irre- \nproachable, virtuous future that seemed to him \nso easy. It seemed to him that he had been vi- \ncious only because he had somehow forgotten \nhow good it is to be virtuous. Not a trace of his \nformer doubts remained in his soul. He firmly \nbelieved in the possibility of the brotherhood \nof men united in the aim of supporting one an- \nother in the path of virtue, and that is how \nFreemasonry presented itself to him. \n\nCHAPTER III \n\nON REACHING Petersburg Pierre did not let \nanyone know of his arrival, he went nowhere \nand spent whole days in reading Thomas a \nKempis, whose book had been sent him by \nsomeone unknown. One thing he continually \nrealized as he read that book: the joy, hitherto \nunknown to him, of believing in the possibil- \nity of attaining perfection, and in the possibil- \nity of active brotherly love among men, which \nJoseph Alex^evich had revealed to him. A \n\n\n\nweek after his arrival, the young Polish count, \nWillarski, whom Pierre had known slightly in \nPetersburg society, came into his room one eve- \nning in the official and ceremonious manner \nin which D61okhov's second had called on him, \nand, having closed the door behind him and \nsatisfied himself that there was nobody else in \nthe room, addressed Pierre. \n\n"I have come to you with a message and an \noffer, Count," he said without sitting down. "A \nperson of very high standing in our Brother- \nhood has made application for you to be re- \nceived into our Order before the usual term \nand has proposed to me to be your sponsor. I \nconsider it a sacred duty to fulfill that person's \nwishes. Do you wish to enter the Brotherhood \nof Freemasons under my sponsorship?" \n\nThe cold, austere tone of this man, whom he \nhad almost always before met at balls, amiably \nsmiling in the society of the most brilliant \nwomen, surprised Pierre. \n\n"Yes, I do wish it," said he. \n\nWillarski bowed his head. \n\n"Onemore question, Count," hesaid, "which \nI beg you to answer in all sincerity not as a \nfuture Mason but as an honest man: have you \nrenounced your former convictions do you be- \nlieve in God?" \n\nPierre considered. \n\n"Yes . . . yes, I believe in God," he said. \n\n"In that case . . ." began Willarski, but Pierre \ninterrupted him. \n\n"Yes, I do believe in God," he repeated. \n\n"In that case we can go," said Willarski. "My \ncarriage is at your service." \n\nWillarski was silent throughout the drive. \nTo Pierre's inquiries as to what he must do and \nhow he should answer, Willarski only replied \nthat brothers more worthy than he would test \nhim and that Pierre had only to tell the truth. \n\nHaving entered the courtyard of a large \nhouse where the Lodge had its headquarters, \nand having ascended a dark staircase, they en- \ntered a small well-lit anteroom where they took \noff their cloaks without the aid of a servant. \nFrom there they passed into another room. A \nman in strange attire appeared at the door. \nWillarski, stepping toward him, said some- \nthing to him in French in an undertone and \nthen went up to a small wardrobe in which \nPierre noticed garments such as he had never \nseen before. Having taken a kerchief from the \ncupboard, Willarski bound Pierre's eyes with \nit and tied it in a knot behind, catching some \nhairs painfully in the knot. Then he drew his \nface down, kissed him, and taking him by the \n\n\n\nBOOK FIVE \n\n\n\n199 \n\n\n\nhand led him forward. The hairs tied in the \nknot hurt Pierre and there were lines of pain \non his face and a shamefaced smile. His huge \nfigure, with arms hanging down and with a \npuckered, though smiling face, moved after \nWillarski with uncertain, timid steps. \n\nHaving led him about ten paces, Willarski \nstopped. \n\n"Whatever happens to you," he said, "you \nmust bear it all manfully if you have firmly re- \nsolved to join our Brotherhood." (Pierre nod- \nded affirmatively.) "When you hear a knock at \nthe door, you will uncover your eyes," added \nWillarski. "I wish you courage and success," \nand, pressing Pierre's hand, he went out. \n\nLeft alone, Pierre went on smiling in the \nsame way. Once or twice he shrugged his shoul- \nders and raised his hand to the kerchief, as if \nwishing to take it off, but let it drop again. \nThe five minutes spent with his eyes bandaged \nseemed to him an hour. His arms felt numb, \nhis legs almost gave way, it seemed to him that \nhe was tired out. He experienced a variety of \nmost complex sensations. He felt afraid of \nwhat would happen to him and still more \nafraid of showing his fear. He felt curious to \nknow what was going to happen and what \nwould be revealed to him; but most of all, he \nfelt joyful that the moment had come when he \nwould at last start on that path of regeneration \nand on the actively virtuous life of which he \nhad been dreaming since he met Joseph Alex- \nevich. Loud knocks were heard at the door. Pi- \nerre took the bandage off his eyes and glanced \naround him. The room was in black darkness, \nonly a small lamp was burning inside some- \nthing white. Pierre went nearer and saw that \nthe lamp stood on a black table on which lay \nan open book. The book was the Gospel, and \nthe white thing with the lamp inside was a hu- \nman skull with its cavities and teeth. After \nreading the first words of the Gospel: "In the \nbeginning was the Word and the Word was \nwith God," Pierre went round the table and \nsaw a large open box filled with something. It \nwas a coffin with bones inside. He was not at \nall surprised by what he saw. Hoping to enter \non an entirely new life quite unlike the old one, \nhe expected everything to be unusual, even \nmore unusual than what he was seeing. A \nskull, a coffin, the Gospel it seemed to him \nthat he had expected all this and even more. \nTrying to stimulate his emotions he looked \naround. "God, death, love, the brotherhood \nof man," he kept saying to himself, associat- \ning these words with vague yet joyful ideas. \n\n\n\nThe door opened and someone came in. \n\nBy the dim light, to which Pierre had already \nbecome accustomed, he saw a rather short man. \nHaving evidently come from the light into the \ndarkness, the man paused, then moved with \ncautious steps toward the table and placed on \nit his small leather-gloved hands. \n\nThis short man had on a white leather apron \nwhich covered his chest and part of his legs; he \nhad on a kind of necklace above which rose a \nhigh white ruffle, outlining his rather long \nface which was lit up from below. \n\n"For what have you come hither?" asked the \nnewcomer, turning in Pierre's direction at a \nslight rustle made by the latter. "Why have you, \nwho do not believe in the truth of the light \nand who have not seen the light, come here? \nWhat do you seek from us? Wisdom, virtue, en- \nlightenment?" \n\nAt the moment the door opened and the \nstranger came in, Pierre felt a sense of awe and \nveneration such as he had experienced in his \nboyhood at confession; he felt himself in the \npresence of one socially a complete stranger, \nyet nearer to him through the brotherhood of \nman. With bated breath and beating heart he \nmoved toward the Rhetor (by which name the \nbrother who prepared a seeker for entrance in- \nto the Brotherhood was known). Drawing near- \ner, he recognized in the Rhetor a man he knew, \nSmolyaninov, and it mortified him to think \nthat the newcomer was an acquaintance he \nwished him simply a brother and a virtuous in- \nstructor. For a long time he could not utter a \nword, so that the Rhetor had to repeat his ques- \ntion. \n\n"Yes ... I ... I ... desire regeneration," \nPierre uttered with difficulty. \n\n"Very well," said Smolyaninov, and went on \nat once: "Have you any idea of the means by \nwhich our holy Order will help you to reach \nyour aim?" said he quietly and quickly. \n\n"I ... hope ... for guidance . . . help ... in \nregeneration," said Pierre, with a trembling \nvoice and some difficulty in utterance due to \nhis excitement and to being unaccustomed to \nspeak of abstract matters in Russian. \n\n"What is your conception of Freemasonry?" \n\n"I imagine that Freemasonry is the fraternity \nand equality of men who have virtuous aims," \nsaid Pierre, feeling ashamed of the inadequacy \nof his words for the solemnity of the moment, \nas he spoke. "I imagine * . ." \n\n"Good!" said the Rhetor quickly, apparent- \nly satisfied with this answer. "Have you sought \nfor means of attaining your aim in religion?" \n\n\n\n2OO \n\n"No, I considered it erroneous and did not \nfollow it," said Pierre, so softly that the Rhetor \ndid not hear him and asked him what he was \nsaying. "I have been an atheist," answered \nPierre. \n\n"You are seeking for truth in order to follow \nits laws in your life, therefore you seek wisdom \nand virtue. Is that not so?" said the Rhetor, \nafter a moment's pause. \n\n"Yes, yes," assented Pierre. \n\nThe Rhetor cleared his throat, crossed his \ngloved hands on his breast, and began to speak. \n\n"Now I must disclose to you the chief aim of \nour Order," he said, "and if this aim coincides \nwith yours, you may enter our Brotherhood \nwith profit. The first and chief object of our \nOrder, the foundation on which it rests and \nwhich no human power can destroy, is the pres- \nervation and handing on to posterity of a cer- \ntain important mystery . . . which has come \ndown to us from the remotest ages, even from \nthe first man a mystery on which perhaps the \nfate of mankind depends. But since this mys- \ntery is of such a nature that nobody can know \nor use it unless he be prepared by long and dil- \nigent self-purification, not everyone can hope \nto attain itquickly. Hencewe have a secondary \naim, that of preparing our members as much as \npossible to reform their hearts, to purify and \nenlighten their minds, by means handed on to \nus by tradition from those who have striven to \nattain this mystery, and thereby to render them \ncapable of receiving it. \n\n"By purifyingand regeneratingour members \nwe try, thirdly, to improve the whole human \nrace, offering it in our members an example of \npiety and virtue, and thereby try with all our \nmight to combat theevil which sways the world. \nThink this over and I will come to you again." \n\n"To combat the evil which sways the world \n. . ." Pierre repeated, and a mental image of his \nfuture activity in this direction rose in his \nmind. He imagined men such as he had himself \nbeen a fortnight ago, and he addressed an edify- \ning exhortation to them. He imagined to him- \nself vicious and unfortunate people whom he \nwould assist by word and deed, imagined op- \npressors whose victims he would rescue. Of the \nthree objects mentioned by the Rhetor, this \nlast, that of improving mankind, especially ap- \npealed to Pierre. The important mystery men- \ntioned by the Rhetor, though it aroused his cu- \nriosity, did not seem to him essential, and the \nsecond aim, that of purifying and regenerating \nhimself, did not much interest him because at \nthat moment he felt with delight that he was \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nalready perfectly cured of his former faults and \nwas ready for all that was good. \n\nHalf an hour later, the Rhetor returned to \ninform the seeker of the seven virtues, corre- \nsponding to the seven steps of Solomon's tem- \nple, which every Freemason should cultivate in \nhimself. These virtues were: i. Discretion, the \nkeeping of the secrets of the Order. 2. Obedi- \nence to those of higher ranks in the Order. \n3. Morality. 4. Love of mankind. 5. Courage. \n6. Generosity. 7. The love of death. \n\n"In the seventh place, try, by the frequent \nthought of death," the Rhetor said, "to bring \nyourself to regard it not as a dreaded foe, but \nas a friend that frees the soul grown weary in \nthe labors of virtue from this distressful life, \nand leads it to its place of recompense and \npeace." \n\n"Yes, that must be so," thought Pierre, when \nafter these words the Rhetor went away, leav- \ning him to solitary meditation. "It must be so, \nbut I am still so weak that I love my life, the \nmeaning of which is only now gradually open- \ning before me." But five of the other virtues \nwhich Pierre recalled, counting them on his \nfingers, he felt already in his soul: courage, \ngenerosity, morality, love of mankind, and es- \npecially obedience which did not even seem to \nhim a virtue, but a joy. (He now felt so glad to \nbe free from his own lawlessness and to sub- \nmit his will to those who knew the indubitable \ntruth.) He forgot what the seventh virtue was \nand could not recall it. \n\nThe third time the Rhetor came back more \nquickly and asked Pierre whether he was still \nfirm in his intention and determined to sub- \nmit to all that would be required of him. \n\n"I am ready for everything," said Pierre. \n\n"I must also inform you," said the Rhetor, \n"that our Order delivers its teaching not in \nwords only but also by other means, which may \nperhaps have a stronger effect on the sincere \nseeker after wisdom and virtue than mere \nwords. This chamberwith what yousee therein \nshould already have suggested to your heart, \nif it is sincere, more than words could do. You \nwill perhaps also see in your further initiation \na like method of enlightenment. Our Order \nimitates the ancient societies that explained \ntheir teaching by hieroglyphics. A hieroglyph," \nsaid the Rhetor, "is an emblem of something \nnot cognizable by the senses but which possess- \nes qualities resembling those of the symbol." \n\nPierre knew very well what a hieroglyph \nwas, but dared not speak. He listened to the \nRhetor in silence, feeling from all he said that \n\n\n\nBOOK FIVE \n\n\n\nhis ordeal was about to begin. \n\n"If you are resolved, I must begin your ini- \ntiation/ 1 said the Rhetor coming closer to \nPierre. "In token of generosity I ask you to \ngive me all your valuables." \n\n"But I have nothing here," replied Pierre, \nsupposing that he was asked to give up all he \npossessed. \n\n"What you have with you: watch, money, \nrings. . . ." \n\nPierre quickly took out his purse and watch, \nbut could not manage for some time to get the \nwedding ring off his fat finger. When that had \nbeen done, the Rhetor said: \n\n"In token of obedience, I ask you to undress." \n\nPierre took off his coat, waistcoat, and left \nboot according to the Rhetor's instructions. \nThe Mason drew the shirt back from Pierre's \nleft breast, and stooping down pulled up the \nleft leg of his trousers to above the knee. \nPierre hurriedly began taking off his right \nboot also and was going to tuck up the other \ntrouser leg to save this stranger the trouble, \nbut the Mason told him that was not neces- \nsary and gave him a slipper for his left foot. \nWith a childlike smile of embarrassment, \ndoubt, and self-derision, which appeared on \nhis face against his will, Pierre stood with his \narms hanging down and legs apart, before \nhis brother Rhetor, and awaited his further \ncommands. \n\n"And now, in token of candor, I ask you to \nreveal to me your chief passion," said the lat- \nter. \n\n"My passion! I have had so many," replied \nPierre. \n\n"That passion which more than all others \ncaused you to waver on the path of virtue," \nsaid the Mason. \n\nPierre paused, seeking a reply. \n\n"Wine? Gluttony? Idleness? Laziness? Irri- \ntability? Anger? Women?" He went over his \nvices in his mind, not knowing to which of \nthem to give the pre-eminence. \n\n"Women," he said in a low, scarcely audible \nvoice. \n\nThe Mason did not move and for a long \ntime said nothing after this answer. At last he \nmoved up to Pierre and, taking the kerchief \nthat lay on the table, again bound his eyes. \n\n"For the last time I say to you turn all your \nattention upon yourself, put a bridle on your \nsenses, and seek blessedness, not in passion but \nin your own heart. The source of blessedness \nis not without us but within. . . ." \n\nPierre had already long been feeling in him- \n\n\n\n201 \n\nself that refreshing source of blessedness which \nnow flooded his heart with glad emotion. \n\nCHAPTER IV \n\nSOON AFTER THIS there came into the dark cham- \nber to fetch Pierre, not the Rhetor but Pierre's \nsponsor, Willarski, whom he recognized by his \nvoice. To fresh questions as to the firmness of \nhis resolution Pierre replied: "Yes, yes, I agree," \nand with a beaming, childlike smile, his fat \nchest uncovered, stepping unevenly and timid- \nly in one slippered and one booted foot, he ad- \nvanced, while Willarski held a sword to his \nbare chest. He was conducted from that room \nalong passages that turned backwards and for- \nwards and was at last brought to the doors of \nthe Lodge. Willarski coughed, he was answered \nby the Masonic knock with mallets, the doors \nopened before them. A bass voice (Pierre was \nstill blindfold) questioned him as to who he \nwas, when and where he was born, and so on. \nThen he was again led somewhere still blind- \nfold, and as they went along he was told alle- \ngories of the toils of his pilgrimage, of holy \nfriendship, of the Eternal Architect of the uni- \nverse, and of the courage with which he should \nendure toils and dangers. During these wander- \nings, Pierre noticed that he was spoken of now \nas the "Seeker," now as the "Sufferer," and now \nas the "Postulant," to the accompaniment of \nvarious knockings with mallets and swords. As \nhe was being led up to some object he noticed \na hesitation and uncertainty among his con- \nductors. He heard those around him disput- \ning in whispers and one of them insisting that \nhe should be led along a certain carpet. After \nthat they took his right hand, placed it on \nsomething, and told him to hold a pair of com- \npasses to his left breast with the other hand and \nto repeat after someone who read aloud an oath \nof fidelity to the laws of the Order. The candles \nwere then extinguished and some spirit lighted, \nas Pierre knew by the smell, and he was told \nthat he would now see the lesser light. The \nbandage was taken off his eyes and, by the faint \nlight of the burning spirit, Pierre, as in a dream, \nsaw several men standing before him, wearing \naprons like the Rhetor's and holding swords in \ntheir hands pointed at his breast. Among them \nstood a man whose white shirt was stained with \nblood. On seeing this, Pierre moved forward \nwith his breast toward the swords, meaning \nthem to pierce it. But the swords were drawn \nback from him and he was at once blindfold- \ned again. \n"Now thou hast seen the lesser light," ut- \n\n\n\n202 \n\ntered a voice. Then the candles were relit and \nhe was told that he would see the full light; the \nbandage was again removed and more than \nten voices said together: "Sic transit gloria mun- \ndi." \n\nPierre gradually began to recover himself \nand looked about at the room and at the peo- \nple in it. Round a long table covered with \nblack sat some twelve men in garments like \nthose he had already seen. Some of them \nPierre had met in Petersburg society. In the \nPresident's chair sat a young man he did not \nknow, with a peculiar cross hanging from his \nneck. On his right sat the Italian abb whom \nPierre had met at Anna Pavlovna's two years \nbefore. There were also present a very distin- \nguished dignitary and a Swiss who had former- \nly been tutor at the Kuragins'. All maintained \na solemn silence, listening to the words of the \nPresident, who held a mallet in his hand. Let \ninto the wall was a star-shaped light. At one \nside of the table was a small carpet with var- \nious figures worked upon it, at the other was \nsomething resembling an altar on which lay \na Testament and a skull. Round it stood seven \nlarge candlesticks like those used in churches. \nTwo of the brothers led Pierre up to the altar, \nplaced his feet at right angles, and bade him lie \ndown, saying that he must prostrate himself \nat the Gates of the Temple. \n\n"He must first receive the trowel," whispered \none of the brothers. \n\n"Oh, hush, please!" said another. \n\nPierre, perplexed, looked round with his \nshortsighted eyes without obeying, and sud- \ndenly doubts arose in his mind. "Where am I? \nWhat am I doing? Aren't they laughing at me? \nShan't I be ashamed to remember this?" But \nthese doubts only lasted a moment. Pierre \nglanced at the serious faces of those around, re- \nmembered all he had already gone through, \nand realized that he could not stop halfway. \nHe was aghast at his hesitation and, trying to \narouse his former devotional feeling, prostrat- \ned himself before the Gates of the Temple. \nAnd really, the feeling of devotion returned to \nhim even more strongly than before. When he \nhad lain there some time, he was told to get up, \nand a white leather apron, such as the others \nwore, was put on him: he was given a trowel \nand three pairs of gloves, and then the Grand \nMaster addressed him. He told him that he \nshould try to do nothing to stain the whiteness \nof that apron, which symbolized strength and \npurity; then of the unexplained trowel, he \ntold him to toil with it to cleanse his own heart \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nfrom vice, and indulgently to smooth with it \nthe heart of his neighbor. As to the first pair of \ngloves, a man's, he said that Pierre could not \nknow their meaning but must keep them. The \nsecond pair of man's gloves he was to wear at \nthe meetings, and finally of the third, a pair of \nwomen's gloves, he said: "Dear brother, these \nwoman's gloves are intended for you too. Give \nthem to the woman whom you shall honor \nmost of all. This gift will be a pledge of your \npurity of heart to her whom you select to be your \nworthy helpmeet in Masonry." And after a \npause, he added: "But beware, dear brother, \nthat these gloves do not deck hands that are \nunclean." While the Grand Master said these \nlast words it seemed to Pierre that he grew em- \nbarrassed. Pierre himself grew still more con- \nfused, blushed like a child till tears came to \nhis eyes, began looking about him uneasily, \nand an awkward pause followed. \n\nThis silence was broken by one of the breth- \nren, who led Pierre up to the rug and began \nreading to him from a manuscript book an ex- \nplanation of all the figures on it: the sun, the \nmoon, a hammer, a plumb line, a trowel, a \nrough stone and a squared stone, a pillar, three \nwindows, and so on. Then a place was assigned \nto Pierre, he was shown the signs of the Lodge, \ntold the password, and at last was permitted to \nsit down. The Grand Master began reading the \nstatutes. They were very long, and Pierre, from \njoy, agitation, and embarrassment, was not in \na state to understand what was being read. He \nmanaged to follow only the last words of the \nstatutes and these remained in his mind. \n\n"In our temples we recognize no other dis- \ntinctions," read the Grand Master, "but those \nbetween virtue and vice. Beware of making any \ndistinctions which may infringe equality. Fly \nto a brother's aid whoever he may be, exhort \nhim who goeth astray, raise him that falleth, \nnever bear malice or enmity toward thy broth- \ner. Be kindly and courteous. Kindle in all \nhearts the flame of virtue. Share thy happiness \nwith thy neighbor, and may envy never dim the \npurity of that bliss. Forgive thy enemy, do not \navenge thyself except by doing him good. Thus \nfulfilling the highest law thou shalt regain \ntraces of the ancient dignity which thou hast \nlost." \n\nHe finished and, getting up, embraced and \nkissed Pierre, who, with tears of joy in his eyes, \nlooked round him, not knowing how to answer \nthe congratulations and greetings from ac- \nquaintances that met him on all sides. He ac- \nknowledged no acquaintances but saw in all \n\n\n\nBOOK FIVE \n\n\n\n203 \n\n\n\nthese men only brothers, and burned with im- \npatience to set to work with them. \n\nThe Grand Master rapped with his mallet. \nAll the Masons sat down in their places, and \none of them read an exhortation on the neces- \nsity of humility. \n\nThe Grand Master proposed that the last du- \nty should be performed, and the distinguished \ndignitary who bore the title of "Collector of \nAlms" went round to all the brothers. Pierre \nwould have liked to subscribe all he had, but \nfearing that it might look like pride subscribed \nthe same amount as the others. \n\nThe meeting was at an end, and on reaching \nhome Pierre felt as if he had returned from a \nlong journey on which he had spent dozens of \nyears, had become completely changed, and \nhad quite left behind his former habits and \nway of life. \n\nCHAPTERV \n\nTHE DAY AFTER he had been received into the \nLodge, Pierre was sitting at home reading a \nbook and trying to fathom the significance of \nthe Square, one side of which symbolized God, \nanother moral things, a third physical things, \nand the fourth a combination of these. Now \nand then his attention wandered from the book \nand the Square and he formed in imagination \na new plan of life. On the previous evening at \nthe Lodge, he had heard that a rumor of his \nduel had reached the Emperor and that it \nwould be wiser for him to leave Petersburg. \nPierre proposed going to his estates in the \nsouth and there attending to the welfare of his \nserfs. He was joyfully planning this new life, \nwhen Prince Vasili suddenly entered the room. \n\n"My dear fellow, what have you been up to \nin Moscow? Why have you quarreled with \nHlne, mon cherf You are under a delusion," \nsaid Prince Vasili, as he entered. "I know all \nabout it, and I can tell you positively that He*- \nlene is as innocent before you as Christ was be- \nfore the Jews." \n\nPierre was about to reply, but Prince Vasili \ninterrupted him. \n\n"And why didn't you simply come straight to \nme as to a friend? I know all about it and un- \nderstand it all," he said. "You behaved as be- \ncomes a man who values his honor, perhaps too \nhastily, but we won't go into that. But consid- \ner the position in which you are placing her \nand me in the eyes of society, and even of the \ncourt," he added, lowering his voice. "She is \nliving in Moscow and you are here. Remember, \ndear boy," and he drew Pierre's arm down- \n\n\n\nwards, "it is simply a misunderstanding. I ex- \npect you feel it so yourself. Let us write her a \nletter at once, and she'll come here and all \nwill be explained, or else, my dear boy, let me \ntell you it's quite likely you'll have to suffer \nfor it." \n\nPrince Vasili gave Pierre a significant look. \n\n"I know from reliable sources that the Dow- \nager Empress is taking a keen interest in the \nwhole affair. You know she is very gracious to \n\n\n\nPierre tried several times to speak, but, on \none hand, Prince Vasfli did not let him and, on \nthe other, Pierre himself feared to begin to \nspeak in the tone of decided refusal and dis- \nagreement in which he had firmly resolved to \nanswer his father-in-law. Moreover, the words \nof the Masonic statutes, "be kindly and courte- \nous," recurred to him. He blinked, went red, \ngot up and sat down again, struggling with \nhimself to do what was for him the most diffi- \ncult thing in lifeto say an unpleasant thing \nto a man's face, to say what the other, whoever \nhe might be, did not expect. He was so used to \nsubmitting to Prince Vasili's tone of careless \nself-assurance that he felt he would be unable \nto withstand it now, but he also felt that on \nwhat he said now his future depended wheth- \ner he would follow the same old road, or that \nnew path so attractively shown him by the Ma- \nsons, on which he firmly believed he would be \nreborn to a new life. \n\n"Now, dear boy," said Prince Vasili playful- \nly, "say 'yes,' and I'll write to her myself, and \nwe will kill the fatted calf." \n\nBut before Prince Vasili had finished his \nplayful speech, Pierre, without looking at him, \nand with a kind of fury that made him like his \nfather, muttered in a whisper: \n\n"Prince, I did not ask you here. Go, please \ngol" And he jumped up and opened the door \nfor him. \n\n"Gol" he repeated, amazed at himself and \nglad to see the look of confusion and fear that \nshowed itself on Prince Vasili's face. \n\n"What's the matter with you? Are you ill?" \n\n"Gol" the quivering voice repeated. And \nPrince Vasili had to go without receiving any \nexplanation. \n\nA week later, Pierre, having taken leave of \nhis new friends, the Masons, and leaving large \nsums of money with them for alms, went away \nto his estates. His new brethren gave him let- \nters to the Kiev and Odessa Masons and prom- \nised to write to him and guide him in his new \nactivity. \n\n\n\n204 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI \n\nTHE DUEL between Pierre and D61okhov was \nhushed up and, in spite of the Emperor's se- \nverity regarding duels at that time, neither the \nprincipals nor their seconds suffered for it. \nBut the story of the duel, confirmed by Pierre's \nrupture with his wife, was the talk of society. \nPierre who had been regarded with patroniz- \ning condescension when he was an illegitimate \nson, and petted and extolled when he was the \nbest match in Russia, had sunk greatly in the \nesteem of society after his marriage when the \nmarriageable daughters and their mothers had \nnothing to hope from himespecially as he did \nnot know how, and did not wish, to court so- \nciety's favor. Now he alone was blamed for \nwhat had happened, he was said to be insanely \njealous and subject like his father to fits of \nbloodthirsty rage. And when after Pierre's de- \nparture Hlene returned to Petersburg, she \nwas received by all her acquaintances not only \ncordially, but even with a shade of deference \ndue to her misfortune. When conversation \nturned on her husband Hlene assumed a dig- \nnified expression, which with characteristic \ntact she had acquired though she did not un- \nderstand its significance. This expression sug- \ngested that she had resolved to endure her \ntroubles uncomplainingly and that her hus- \nband was a cross laid upon her by God. Prince \nVasfli expressed his opinion more openly. He \nshrugged his shoulders when Pierre was men- \ntioned and, pointing to his forehead, remarked: \n"A bit touched I always said so." \n"I said from the first," declared Anna Pav- \nlovna referring to Pierre, "I said at the time \nand before anyone else" (she insisted on her \npriority) "that that senseless young man was \nspoiled by the depraved ideas of these days. I \nsaid so even at the time when everybody was \nin raptures about him, when he had just re- \nturned from abroad, and when, if you remem- \nber, he posed as a sort of Marat at one of my \nsoirees. And how has it ended? I was against \nthis marriage even then and foretold all that \nhas happened." \n\nAnna Pavlovna continued to give on free eve- \nnings the same kind of soirees as before such \nas she alone had the gift of arranging at which \nwas to be found "the cream of really good so- \nciety, the bloom of the intellectual essence of \nPetersburg," as she herself put it. Besides this \nrefined selection of society Anna Pdvlovna's \nreceptions were also distinguished by the fact \nthat she always presented some new and inter- \nesting person to the visitors and that nowhere \n\n\n\nelse was the state of the political thermometer \nof legitimate Petersburg court society so clear- \nly and distinctly indicated. \n\nToward the end of 1806, when all the sad \ndetails of Napoleon's destruction of the Prus- \nsian army at Jena and Auerstadt and the sur- \nrender of most of the Prussian fortresses had \nbeen received, when our troops had already \nentered Prussia and our second war with Na- \npoleon was beginning, Anna Pavlovna gave one \nof her soirees. The "cream of really good soci- \nety" consisted of the fascinating Hlne, for- \nsaken by her husband, Mortemart, the delight- \nful Prince Hippolyte who had just returned \nfrom Vienna, two diplomatists, the old aunt, a \nyoung man referred to in that drawing room as \n"a man of great merit" (un homme de beau- \ncoup de mMte), a newly appointed maid of \nhonor and her mother, and several other less \nnoteworthy persons. \n\nThe novelty Anna Pdvlovna was setting be- \nfore her guests that evening was Boris Drubet- \nsk6y, who had just arrived as a special mes- \nsenger from the Prussian army and was aide- \nde-camp to a very important personage. \n\nThe temperature shown by the political \nthermometer to the company that evening was \nthis: \n\n"Whatever the European sovereigns and com- \nmanders may do to countenance Bonaparte, \nand to cause me y and us in general, annoyance \nand mortification, our opinion of Bonaparte \ncannot alter. We shall not cease to express our \nsincere views on that subject, and can only say \nto the Kingof Prussia and others: 'So much the \nworse for you. Tu Vas voulu, George Dandin,' l \nthat's all we have to say about it!" \n\nWhen Boris, who was to be served up to the \nguests, entered the drawing room, almost all \nthe company had assembled, and the conversa- \ntion, guided by Anna Pdvlovna, was about our \ndiplomatic relations with Austria and the hope \nof an alliance with her. \n\nBoris, grown more manly and looking fresh, \nrosy and self-possessed, entered the drawing \nroom elegantly dressed in the uniform of an \naide-de-camp and was duly conducted to pay \nhis respects to the aunt and then brought back \nto the general circle. \n\nAnna Pavlovna gave him her shriveled hand \nto kiss and introduced him to several persons \nwhom he did not know, giving him a whispered \ndescription of each. \n\n"Prince Hippolyte Kurdgin charming \n\n1 "You would have it so." George Dandin is a \ncomedy by Moli&amp;re. TR, \n\n\n\nBOOK FIVE \n\n\n\n205 \n\n\n\nyoung fellow; M. Kronqcharg d'affaires from \nCopenhagen a profound intellect/' and sim- \nply, "Mr. Shftov a man of great merit" this \nof the man usually so described. \n\nThanks to Anna Mikhdylovna's efforts, his \nown tastes, and the peculiarities of his reserved \nnature, Boris had managed during his service \nto place himself very advantageously. He was \naide-de-camp to a very important personage, \nhad been sent on a very important mission to \nPrussia, and had just returned from there as a \nspecial messenger. He had become thoroughly \nconversant with that unwritten code with which \nhe had been so pleased at Olmutz and accord- \ning to which an ensign might rank incompa- \nrably higher than a general, and according to \nwhich what was needed for success in the serv- \n- ice was not effort or work, or courage, or perse- \nverance, but only the knowledge of how to get \non with those who can grant rewards, and he \nwas himself often surprised at the rapidity of \nhis success and at the inability of others* to un- \nderstand these things. In consequence of this \ndiscovery his whole manner of life, all his re- \nlations with old friends, all his plans for his \nfuture, were completely altered. He was not \nrich, but would spend his last groat to be bet- \nter dressed than others, and would rather de- \nprive himself of many pleasures than allow \nhimself to be seen in a shabby equipage or ap- \npear in the streets of Petersburg in an old uni- \nform. He made friends with and sought the ac- \nquaintance of only those above him in posi- \ntion and who could therefore be of use to him. \nHe liked Petersburg and despised Moscow. \nThe remembrance of the Rostovs' house and \nof his childish love for Natasha was unpleasant \nto him and he had not once been to see the \nRost6vs since the day of his departure for the \narmy. To be in Anna Pavlovna's drawing room \nhe considered an important step up in the serv- \nice, and he at once understood his role, letting \nhis hostess make use of whatever interest he \nhad to offer. He himself carefully scanned each \nface, appraising the possibilities of establish- \ning intimacy with each of those present, and \nthe advantages that might accrue. He took the \nseat indicated to him beside the fair He"lene \nand listened to the general conversation. \n\n"Vienna considers the bases of the proposed \ntreaty so unattainable that not even a continu- \nity of most brilliant successes would secure \nthem, and she doubts the means we have of \ngaining them. That is the actual phrase used \nby the Vienna cabinet/' said the Danish charge* \nd'affaires. \n\n\n\n"The doubt is flattering/' said "the man of \nprofound intellect/' with a subtle smile. \n\n"We must distinguish between the Vienna \ncabinet and the Emperor of Austria/' said \nMortemart. "The Emperor of Austria can nev- \ner have thought of such a thing, it is only the \ncabinet that says it." \n\n"Ah, my dear vicomte," put in Anna Pdvlov- \nna, "L'Urope" (for some reason she called it \nUrope as if that were a specially refined French \npronunciation which she could allow herself \nwhen con versing with a Frenchman), "L'Urope \nne sera jamais noire allide sincere." l \n\nAfter that Anna Pavlovna led up to the \ncourage and firmness of the King of Prussia, in \norder to draw Boris into the conversation. \n\nBoris listened attentively to each of the \nspeakers, awaitinghis turn, but managed mean- \nwhile to look round repeatedly at his neigh" \nbor, the beautiful He4ene, whose eyes severa* \ntimes met those of the handsome young aide \nde-camp with a smile. "&gt; \n\nSpeaking of the position of Prussia, Ann' \nPdvlovna very naturally asked Boris to te v \nthem about his journey to Glogau and in wha 1 \nstate he found the Prussian army. Boris, speak- \ning with deliberation, told them in pure, cor- \nrect French many interesting details about \nthe armies and the court, carefully abstaining \nfrom expressing an opinion of his own about \nthe facts he was recounting. For some time \nhe engrossed the general attention, and \nAnna Pdvlovna felt that the novelty she \nhad served up was received with pleasure by \nall her visitors. The greatest attention of \nall to Boris* narrative was shown by Hlne. \nShe asked him several questions about his \njourney and seemed greatly interested in \nthe state of the Prussian army. As soon as he \nhad finished she turned to him with her usual \nsmile. \n\n"You absolutely must come and see me," she \nsaid in a tone that implied that, for certain con- \nsiderations he could not know of, this was ab- \nsolutely necessary. \n\n"On Tuesday between eight and nine. It \nwill give me great pleasure." \n\nBoris promised to fulfill her wish and was \nabout to begin a conversation with her, when \nAnna PAvlovna called him away on the pretext \nthat her aunt wished to hear him. \n\n"You know her husband, of course?" said \nAnna Pdvlovna, dosing her eyes and indicat- \ning Hdene with a sorrowful gesture. "Ah, she \nis such an unfortunate and channing woman ! \n\n1 "Europe will never be our sincere ally." \n\n\n\n206 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nDon't mention him before her please don't I It \nis too painful for her!" \n\nCHAPTER VII \n\nWHEN BORIS and Anna Pdvlovna returned to \nthe others Prince Hippolyte had the ear of the \ncompany. \n\nBending forward in his armchair he said: \n"Le Roi de Prusse!" and having said this \nlaughed. Everyone turned toward him. \n\n"Le Roi de Prusse?" Hippolyte said inter- \nrogatively, again laughing, and then calmly \nand seriously sat back in his chair. Anna Pdv- \nlovna waited for him to go on, but asheseemed \nquite decided to say no more she began to tell \nof how at Potsdam the impious Bonaparte had \nstolen the sword of Frederick the Great. \n\n"It is the sword of Frederick the Great which \n\n. . ." she began, but Hippolyte interrupted \nicr with the words: "Le Roi de Prusse . . ." and \ntgain,assoon as all turned toward him, excused \ntimself and said no more. \n\nAnna Pdvlovna frowned. Mortemart, Hip- \nKByte's friend, addressed him firmly. \n\n"Come now, what about your R oide Prusse?" \n\nHippolyte laughed as if ashamed of laugh- \ning. \n\n"Oh, it's nothing. I only wished to say . . ." \n(he wanted to repeat a joke he had heard in \nVienna and which he had been trying all that \nevening to get in) "I only wished to say that \nwe are wrong to fight pour le Roi de Prusse!" l \n\nBoris smiled circumspectly, so that it might \nbe taken as ironical or appreciative according \nto the way the joke was received. Everybody \nlaughed. \n\n"Your joke is too bad, it's witty but unjust," \nsaid Anna Pdvlovna, shaking her little shriveled \nfinger at him. \n\n"We are not fighting pour le Roi de Prusse f \nbut for right principles. Oh, that wicked Prince \nHippolyte!" she said. \n\nThe conversation did not flag all evening \nand turned chiefly on the political news. It be- \ncame particularly animated toward the end of \nthe evening when the rewards bestowed by the \nEmperor were mentioned. \n\n"You know N N received a snuffbox with \nthe portrait last year?" said "the man of pro- \nfound intellect." "Why shouldn't S- S- get \nthe same distinction?" \n\n"Pardon me! A snuffbox with the Emperor's \nportrait is a reward but not a distinction," said \nthe diplomatist "a gift, rather." \n\n14 Tor the King of Prussia" a phrase used in \nFrench to denote "for a trifle of no value." TR. \n\n\n\n"There are precedents, I may mention \nSchwarzenberg." \n\n"It's impossible," replied another. \n\n"Will you bet? The ribbon of the order is a \ndifferent matter " \n\nWhen everybody rose to go, Hlne who \nhad spoken very little all the evening again \nturned to Boris, asking him in a tone of caress- \ning significant command to come to her on \nTuesday. \n\n"It is of great importance to me," she said, \nturning with a smile toward Anna Pdvlovna, \nand Anna Pdvlovna, with the same sad smile \nwith which she spoke of her exalted patroness, \nsupported Hdtene's wish. \n\nIt seemed as if from some words Boris had \nspoken that evening about the Prussian army, \nHlne had suddenly found it necessary to see \nhim. She seemed to promise to explain that ne- \ncessity to him when he came on Tuesday. \n\nBut on Tuesday evening, having come to \nHlrte's splendid salon, Boris received no clear \nexplanation of why it had been necessary for \nhim to come. There were other guests and the \ncountess talked little to him, and only as he \nkissed her hand on taking leave said unexpect- \nedly and in a whisper, with a strangely unsmil- \ning face: "Come to dinner tomorrow ... in the \nevening. You must come . . . Come!" \n\nDuring that stay in Petersburg, Boris became \nan intimate in the countess* house. \n\nCHAPTER VIII \n\nTHE WAR was flaming up and nearing the Rus- \nsian frontier. Everywhere one heard curses on \nBonaparte, "the enemy of mankind." Militia- \nmen and recruits were being enrolled in the \nvillages, and from the seat of war came contra- \ndictory news, false as usual and therefore vari- \nously interpreted. The life of old Prince Bol- \nk6nski, Prince Andrew, and Princess Mary had \ngreatly changed since 1805. \n\nIn 1806 the old prince was made one of the \neight commanders in chief then appointed to \nsupervise the enrollment decreed throughout \nRussia. Despite the weakness of age, which had \nbecome particularly noticeable since the time \nwhen he thought his son had been killed, he \ndid not think it right to refuse a duty to which \nhe had been appointed by the Emperor him- \nself, and this fresh opportunity for action gave \nhim new energy and strength. He was continu- \nally traveling through the three provinces en- \ntrusted to him, was pedantic in the fulfillment \nof his duties, severe to cruelty with his subordi- \nnates, and went into everything down to the \n\n\n\nBOOK FIVE \n\n\n\n207 \n\n\n\nminutest details himself. Princess Mary had \nceased taking lessons in mathematics from her \nfather, and when the old prince was at home \nwent to his study with the wet nurse and little \nPrince Nicholas (as his grandfather called \nhim). The baby Prince Nicholas lived with his \nwet nurse and nurse Sdvishna in the late prin- \ncess 1 rooms and Princess Mary spent most of \nthe day in the nursery, taking a mother's place \nto her little nephew as best she could. Made- \nmoiselle Bourienne, too, seemed passionately \nfond of the boy, and Princess Mary often de- \nprived herself to give her friend the pleasure \nof dandling the little angel as she called her \nnephew and playing with him. \n\nNear the altar of the church at Bald Hills \nthere was a chapel over the tomb of the little \nprincess, and in this chapel was a marble monu- \nment brought from Italy, representingan angel \nwith outspread wings ready to fly upwards. \nThe angel's upper lip was slightly raised as \nthough about to smile, and once on coming \nout of the chapel Prince Andrew and Princess \nMary admitted to one another that the angel's \nface reminded them strangely of the little prin- \ncess. But what was still stranger, though of this \nPrince Andrew said nothing to his sister, was \nthat in the expression the sculptor had hap- \npened to give the angel's face, Prince Andrew \nread the same mild reproach he had read on \nthe face of his dead wife: "Ah, why have you \ndone this to me?" \n\nSoon after Prince Andrew's return the old \nprince made over to him a large estate, Bogu- \nchdrovo, about twenty-five miles from Bald \nHills. Partly because of the depressing memo- \nries associated with Bald Hills, partly because \nPrince Andrew did not always feel equal to \nbearing with his father's peculiarities, and part- \nly because he needed solitude, Prince Andrew \nmade use of Bogucharovo, began building and \nspent most of his time there. \n\nAfter the Austerlitz campaign Prince An- \ndrew had firmly resolved not to continue his \nmilitary service, and when the war recom- \nmenced and everybody had to serve, he took a \npost under his father in the recruitment so as \nto avoid active service. The old prince and his \nson seemed to have changed roles since the \ncampaign of 1805. The old man, roused by ac- \ntivity, expected the best results from the new \ncampaign, while Prince Andrew on the con- \ntrary, taking no part in the war and secretly \nregretting this, saw only the dark side. \n\nOn February 26, 1807, the old prince set off \non one of his circuits. Prince Andrew remained \n\n\n\nat Bald Hills as usual during his father's ab- \nsence. Little Nicholas had been unwell for \nfour days. The coachman who had driven the \nold prince to town returned bringing papers \nand letters for Prince Andrew. \n\nNot finding the young prince in his study \nthe valet went with the letters to Princess \nMary's apartments, but did not find him there. \nHe was told that the prince had gone to the \nnursery. \n\n"If you please, your excellency, Petriisha has \nbrought some papers," said one of the nurse- \nmaids to Prince Andrew who was sitting on a \nchild's little chair while, frowning and with \ntrembling hands, he poured drops from a medi- \ncine bottle into a wineglass half full of water. \n\n"What is it?" he said crossly, and, his hand \nshaking unintentionally, he poured too many \ndrops into the glass. He threw the mixture on- \nto the floor and asked for some more water. \nThe maid brought it. \n\nThere were in the room a child's cot, two \nboxes, two armchairs, a table, a child's table, \nand the little chair on which Prince Andrew \nwas sitting. The curtains were drawn, and a \nsingle candle was burningon the table, screened \nby a bound music book so that the light did not \nfall on the cot. \n\n"My dear," said Princess Mary, addressing \nher brother from beside the cot where she was \nstanding, "better wait a bit ... later . . ." \n\n"Oh, leave off, you always talk nonsense and \nkeep putting things off and this is what comes \nof itl" said Prince Andrew in an exasperated \nwhisper, evidently meaning to wound his sis- \nter. \n\n"My dear, really . . . it's better not to wake \nhim . . . he's asleep," said the princess in a tone \nof entreaty. \n\nPrince Andrew got up and went on tiptoe \nup to the little bed, wineglass in hand. \n\n"Perhaps we'd really better not wake him," \nhe said hesitating. \n\n"As you please . . . really ... I think so ... \nbut as you please," said Princess Mary, evident- \nly intimidated and confused that her opinion \nhad prevailed. She drew her brother's atten- \ntion to the maid who was calling him in a whis- \nper. \n\nIt was the second night that neither of them \nhad slept, watching the boy who was in a high \nfever. These last days, mistrusting their house- \nhold doctor and expecting another for whom \nthey had sent to town, they had been trying \nfirst one remedy and then another. Worn out \nby sleeplessness and anxiety they threw their \n\n\n\n208 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nburden of sorrow on one another, and re- \nproached and disputed with each other. \n\n"Petriisha has come with papers from your \nfather," whispered the maid. \n\nPrince Andrew went out. \n\n"Devil take them!" he muttered, and after \nlistening to the verbal instructions his father \nhad sent and taking the correspondence and \nhis father's letter, he returned to the nursery. \n\n"Well?" he asked. \n\n"Still the same. Wait, for heaven's sake. Karl \nIvnich always says that sleep is more impor- \ntant than anything," whispered Princess Mary \nwith a sigh. \n\nPrince Andrew went up to the child and felt \nhim. He was burning hot. \n\n"Confound you and your Karl Ivdnich!" He \ntook the glass with the drops and again went \nup to the cot. \n\n"Andrew, don't!" said Princess Mary. \n\nBut he scowled at her angrily though also \nwith suffering in his eyes, and stooped glass in \nhand over the infant. \n\n"But I wish it," he said. "I beg yougive it \nhim!" \n\nPrincess Mary shrugged her shoulders but \ntook the glass submissively and calling the \nnurse began giving the medicine. The child \nscreamed hoarsely. Prince Andrew winced and, \nclutching his head, went out and sat down on \na sofa in the next room. \n\nHe still had all the letters in his hand. Open- \ning them mechanically he began reading. The \nold prince, now and then using abbreviations, \nwrote in his large elongated hand on blue pa- \nper as follows : \n\nHave just this moment received by special mes- \nsenger very joyful newsif it's not false. Bennig- \nsen seems to have obtained a complete victory over \nBuonaparte at Eyiau. In Petersburg everyone is \nrejoicing, and the rewards sent to the army are \ninnumerable. Though he is a German I congrat- \nulate him! I can't make out what the commander \nat K6rchevo a certain Khandrik6v is up to; till \nnow the additional men and provisions have not \narrived. Gallop off to him at once and say I'll have \nhis head off if everything is not here in a week. \nHave received another letter about the Preussisch- \nEylau battle from P&amp;enka he took part in it \nand it's all true. When mischief-makers don't med- \ndle even a German beats Buonaparte. He is said to \nbe fleeing in great disorder. Mind you gallop off to \nK6rchevo without delay and carry out instruc- \ntions! \n\nPrince Andrew sighed and broke the seal of \nanother envelope. It was a closely written let- \nter of two sheets from Bilibin. He folded it up \n\n\n\nwithout reading it and reread his father's let- \nter, ending with the words: "Gallop off to K6r- \nchevo and carry out instructions!" \n\n"No, pardon me, I won't go now till the \nchild is better," thought he, going to the door \nand looking into the nursery. \n\nPrincess Mary was still standing by the cot, \ngently rocking the baby. \n\n"Ah yes, and what else did he say that's un- \npleasant?" thought Prince Andrew, recalling \nhis father's letter. "Yes, we have gained a vic- \ntory over Bonaparte, just when I'm not serv- \ning. Yes, yes, he's always poking fun at me \n\nAh, well! Let him!" And he began reading Bil- \nibin's letter which was written in French. He \nread without understanding half of it, read on- \nly to forget, if but for a moment, what he had \ntoo long been thinking of so painfully to the \nexclusion of all else. \n\nCHAPTER IX \n\nBIL!BIN WAS NOW at army headquarters in a \ndiplomatic capacity, and though he wrote in \nFrench and used French jests and French id- \nioms, he described the whole campaign with a \nfearless self-censure and self-derision genuine- \nly Russian. Bilfbin wrote that the obligation of \ndiplomatic discretion tormented him, and he \nwas happy to have in Prince Andrew a reliable \ncorrespondent to whom he could pour out the \nbile he had accumulated at the sight of all that \nwas being done in the army. The letter was \nold, having been written before the battle at \nPreussisch-Eylau. \n\n"Since the day of our brilliant success at Aus- \nterlitz," wrote Bilfbin, "as you know, my dear \nprince, I never leave headquarters. I have cer- \ntainly acquired a taste for war, and it is just as \nwell for me; what I have seen during these last \nthree months is incredible. \n\n"I begin ab ovo. 'The enemy of the human \nrace,' as you know, attacks the Prussians. The \nPrussians are our faithful allies who have only \nbetrayed us three times in three years. We take \nup their cause, but it turns out that 'the enemy \nof the human race' pays no heed to our fine \nspeeches and in his rude and savage way \nthrows himself on the Prussians without giving \nthem time to finish the parade they had begun, \nand in two twists of the hand he breaks them \nto smithereens and installs himself in the pal- \nace at Potsdam. \n\n" 1 most ardently desire/ writes the King of \nPrussia to Bonaparte, 'that Your Majesty should \nbe received and treated in my palace in a man- \nner agreeable to yourself, and in so far as cir- \n\n\n\nBOOK FIVE \n\n\n\n209 \n\n\n\ncumstances allowed, I have hastened to take \nall steps to that end. May I have succeeded!' \nThe Prussian generals pride themselves on be- \ning polite to the French and lay down their \narms at the first demand. \n\n"The head of the garrison at Glogau, with \nten thousand men, asks the King of Prussia \nwhat he is to do if he is summoned to surren- \nder. . . . All this is absolutely true. \n\n"In short, hoping to settle matters by taking \nup a warlike attitude, it turns out that we have \nlanded ourselves in war, and what is more, in \nwar on our own frontiers, with and for the King \nof Prussia. We have everything in perfect or- \nder, only one little thing is lacking, namely, a \ncommander in chief. As it was considered that \nthe Austerlitz success might have been more \ndecisive had the commander in chief not been \nso young, all our octogenarians were reviewed, \nand of Prozor6vski and Kmenski the latter \nwas preferred. The general comes to us, Suv6- \nrov-like, in a kibitka, 1 and is received with ac- \nclamations of joy and triumph. \n\n"On the 4th, the first courier arrives from \nPetersburg. The mails are taken to the field \nmarshal's room, for he likes to do everything \nhimself. I am called in to help sort the letters \nand take those meant for us. The field marshal \nlooks on and waits for letters addressed to him. \nWe search, but none are to be found. The field \nmarshal grows impatient and sets to work him- \nself and finds letters from the Emperor to \nCount T., Prince V., and others. Then he bursts \ninto one of his wild furies and rages at every- \none and everything, seizes the letters, opens \nthem, and reads those from the Emperor ad- \ndressed to others. 'Ah! So that's the way they \ntreat me! No confidence in me! Ah, ordered to \nkeep an eye on me! Very well then! Get along \nwith you!' So he writes the famous order of the \nclay to General Bennigsen: \n\n" 'I am wounded and cannot ride and conse- \nquently cannot command the army. You have \nbrought your army corps to Pultiisk, routed: \nhere it is exposed, and without fuel or forage, \nso something must be done, and, as you your- \nself reported to Count Buxhowden yesterday, \nyou must think of retreating to our frontier \nwhich do today.' \n\n" 'From all my riding,' he writes to the Em- \nperor, 'I have got a saddle sore which, coming \nafter all my previous journeys, quite prevents \nmy riding and commanding so vast an army, \nso I have passed on the command to the gen- \n\n1 An old-fashioned wooden cart with a covered \ntop.-TR. \n\n\n\neral next in seniority, Count Buxhowden, hav- \ning sent him my whole staff and all that be- \nlongs to it, advising him if there is a lack of \nbread, to move farther into the interior of \nPrussia, for only one day's ration of bread re- \nmains, and in some regiments none at all, as \nreported by the division commanders, Oster- \nmann and Sedmorckzki, and all that the peas- \nants had has been eaten up. I myself will re- \nmain in hospital at Ostrolenka till I recover. \nIn regard to which I humbly submit my re- \nport, with the information that if the army re- \nmains in its present bivouac another fortnight \nthere will not be a healthy man left in it by \nspring. \n\n" 'Grant leave to retire to his country seat to \nan old man who is already in any case dishon- \nored by being unable to fulfill the great and \nglorious task for which he was chosen. I shall \nawait your most gracious permission here in \nhospital, that I may not have to play the part \nof a secretary rather than commander in the \narmy. My removal from the army does not pro- \nduce the slightest stir a blind man has left it. \nThere are thousands such as I in Russia.' \n\n"The field marshal is angry with the Emper- \nor and he punishes us all, isn't it logical? \n\n"This is the first act. Those that follow are \nnaturally increasingly interesting and enter- \ntaining. After the field marshal's departure it \nappears that we are within sight of the enemy \nand must give battle. Buxhowden is command- \ner in chief by seniority, but General Bennig- \nsen does not quite see it; more particularly as \nit is he and his corps who are within sight of \nthe enemy and he wishes to profit by the op- \nportunity to fight a battle 'on his own hand* as \nthe Germans say. He does so. This is the battle \nof Pultiisk, which is considered a great victory \nbut in my opinion was nothing of the kind. \nWe civilians, as you know, have a very bad way \nof deciding whether a battle was won or lost. \nThose who retreat after a battle have lost it is \nwhat we say; and according to that it is we who \nlost the battle of Pultiisk. In short, we retreat \nafter the battle but send a courier to Peters- \nburg with news of a victory, and General Ben- \nnigsen, hoping to receive from Petersburg the \npost of commander in chief as a reward for his \nvictory, does not give up the command of the \narmy to General Buxhowden. During this in- \nterregnum we begin a very original and inter- \nesting series of maneuvers. Our aim is no \nlonger, as it should be, to avoid or attack the \nenemy, but solely to avoid General Buxhowden \nwho by right of seniority should be our chief. \n\n\n\n210 \n\nSo energetically do we pursue this aim that aft- \ner crossing an unfordable river we burn the \nbridges to separate ourselves from our enemy, \nwho at the moment is not Bonaparte but Bux- \nhowden. General Buxhowden was all but at- \ntacked and captured by a superior enemy force \nas a result of one of these maneuvers that en- \nabled us to escape him. Buxhowden pursues us \nwe scuttle. He hardly crosses the river to our \nside before we recross to the other. At last our \nenemy, Buxhowden, catches us and attacks. \nBoth generals are angry, and the result is a \nchallenge on Buxhowden's part and an epilep- \ntic fit on Bennigsen's. But at the critical mo- \nment the courier who carried the news of our \nvictory at Pulttisk to Petersburg returns bring- \ning our appointment as commander in chief, \nand our first foe, Buxhowden, is vanquished; \nwe can now turn our thoughts to the second, \nBonaparte. But as it turns out, just at that mo- \nment a third enemy rises before usnamely \nthe Orthodox Russian soldiers, loudly demand- \ning bread, meat, biscuits, fodder, and whatnot! \nThe stores are empty, the roads impassable. \nThe Orthodox begin looting, and in a way of \nwhich our last campaign can give you no idea. \nHalf the regiments form bands and scour the \ncountryside and put everything to fire and \nsword. The inhabitants are totally ruined, the \nhospitals overflow with sick, and famine is \neverywhere. Twice the marauders even attack \nour headquarters, and the commander in chief \nhas to ask for a battalion to disperse them. \nDuring one of these attacks they carried off my \nempty portmanteau and my dressing gown. \nThe Emperor proposes to give all commanders \nof divisions the right to shoot marauders, but \nI much fear this will oblige one half the army \nto shoot the other." \n\nAt first Prince Andrew read with his eyes \nonly, but after a while, in spite of himself (al- \nthough he knew how far it was safe to trust \nBilibin), what he had read began to interest \nhim more and more. When he had read thus \nfar, he crumpled the letter up and threw it \naway. It was not what he had read that vexed \nhim, but the fact that the life out there in which \nhe had now no part could perturb him. He \nshut his eyes, rubbed his forehead as if to rid \nhimself of all interest in what he had read, and \nlistened to what was passing in the nursery. \nSuddenly he thought he heard a strange noise \nthrough the door. He was seized with alarm \nlest something should have happened to the \nchild while he was reading the letter. He went \non tiptoe to the nursery door and opened it. \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nJust as he went in he saw that the nurse was \nhiding something from him with a scared look \nand that Princess Mary was no longer by the \ncot. \n\n"My dear," he heard what seemed to him her \ndespairing whisper behind him. \n\nAs often happens afterlongsleeplessnessand \nlong anxiety, he was seized by an unreasoning \npanic it occurred to him that the child was \ndead. All that he saw and heard seemed to con- \nfirm this terror. \n\n"All is over," he thought, and a cold sweat \nbroke out on his forehead. He went to the cot \nin confusion, sure that he would find it empty \nand that the nurse had been hiding the dead \nbaby. He drew the curtain aside and for some \ntime his frightened, restless eyes could not find \nthe baby. At last he saw him: the rosy boy had \ntossed about till he lay across the bed with his \nhead lower than the pillow, and was smacking \nhis lips in his sleep and breathing evenly. \n\nPrince Andrew was as glad to find the boy \nlike that, as if he had already lost him. He bent \nover him and, as his sister had taught him, \ntried with his lips whether the child was still \nfeverish. The soft forehead was moist. Prince \nAndrew touched the head with his hand; even \nthe hair was wet, so profusely had the child \nperspired. He was not dead, but evidently the \ncrisis was over and he was convalescent. Prince \nAndrew longed to snatch up, to squeeze, to \nhold to his heart, this helpless little creature, \nbut dared not do so. He stood over him, gazing \nat his head and at the little arms and legs \nwhich showed under the blanket. He heard a \nrustle behind him and a shadow appeared un- \nder the curtain of the cot. He did not look \nround, but still gazing at the infant's face lis- \ntened to his regular breathing. The dark shad- \now was Princess Mary, who had come up to the \ncot with noiseless steps, lifted the curtain, and \ndropped it again behind her. Prince Andrew \nrecognized her without looking and held out \nhis hand to her. She pressed it. \n\n"He has perspired," said Prince Andrew. \n\n"I was coming to tell you so." \n\nThe child movedslightly in his sleep,smiled, \nand rubbed his forehead against the pillow. \n\nPrince Andrew looked at his sister. In the \ndim shadow of the curtain her luminous eyes \nshone more brightly than usual from the tears \nof joy that were in them. She leaned over to \nher brother and kissed him, slightly catching \nthe curtain of the cot. Each made the other a \nwarning gesture and stood still in the dim \nlight beneath the curtain as if not wishing to \n\n\n\nBOOK FIVE \n\n\n\n211 \n\n\n\nleave that seclusion where they three were shut \noff from all the world. Prince Andrew was the \nfirst to move away, ruffling his hair against the \nmuslin of the curtain. \n\n"Yes, this is the one thing left me now/' he \nsaid with a sigh. \n\nCHAPTER X \n\nSOON AFTER his admission to the Masonic Broth- \nerhood, Pierre went to the Kiev province, \nwhere he had the greatest number of serfs, tak- \ning with him full directions which he had writ- \nten down for his own guidance as to what he \nshould do on his estates. \n\nWhen he reached Kiev he sent for all his \nstewards to the head office and explained to \nthem his intentions and wishes. He told them \nthat steps would be taken immediately to free \nhis serfs and that till then they were not to be \noverburdened with labor, women while nurs- \ning their babies were not to be sent to work, \nassistance was to be given to the serfs, punish- \nments were to be admonitory and not corporal, \nand hospitals, asylums, and schools were to be \nestablished on all the estates. Some of the stew- \nards (there were semiliterate foremen among \nthem) listened with alarm, supposing these \nwords to mean that the young count was dis- \npleased with their management and embezzle- \nment of money, some after their first fright \nwere amused by Pierre's lisp and the new words \nthey had not heard before, others simply en- \njoyed hearing how the master talked, while the \ncleverest among them, including the chief \nsteward, understood from this speech how they \ncould best handle the master for their own \nends. \n\nThe chief steward expressed great sympathy \nwith Pierre's intentions, but remarked that be- \nsides these changes it would be necessary to go \ninto the general state of affairs which was far \nfrom satisfactory. \n\nDespite Count Bezukhov's enormous wealth, \nsince he had come into an income which was \nsaid to amount to five hundred thousand ru- \nbles a year, Pierre felt himself far poorer than \nwhen his father had made him an allowance \nof ten thousand rubles. He had a dim percep- \ntion of the following budget: \n\nAbout 80,000 went in payments on all the \nestates to the Land Bank, about 30,000 went \nfor the upkeep of the estate near Moscow, the \ntown house, and the allowance to the three \nprincesses; about 15,000 was given in pensions \nand the same amount for asylums; 150,000 ali- \nmony was sent to the countess; about 70,000 \n\n\n\nwent for interest on debts. The building of a \nnew church, previously begun, had cost about \n10,000 in each of the last two years, and he \ndid not know how the rest, about 100,000 \nrubles, was spent, and almost every year he was \nobliged to borrow. Besides this the chief stew- \nard wrote every year telling him of fires and \nbad harvests, or of the necessity of rebuild- \ning factories and workshops. So the first task \nPierre had to face was one for which he had \nvery little aptitude or inclination practical \nbusiness. \n\nHe discussed estate affairs every day with his \nchief steward. But he felt that this did not for- \nward matters at all. He felt that these consulta- \ntions were detached from real affairs and did \nnot link up with them or make them move. On \nthe one hand, the chief steward put the state of \nthings to him in the very worst light, pointing \nout the necessity of paying off the debts and \nundertaking new activities with serf labor, to \nwhich Pierre did not agree. On the other hand, \nPierre demanded that steps should be taken to \nliberate the serfs, which the steward met by \nshowing the necessity of first paying off the \nloans from the Land Bank, and theconsequent \nimpossibility of a speedy emancipation. \n\nThe steward did not say it was quite impos- \nsible, but suggested selling the forests in the \nprovince of Kostroma, the land lower down \nthe river, and the Crimean estate, in order to \nmake it possible: all of which operations ac- \ncording to him were connected with such com- \nplicated measuresthe removal of injunctions, \npetitions, permits, and so on that Pierre be- \ncame quite bewildered and only replied: \n\n"Yes, yes, do so." \n\nPierre had none of the practical persistence \nthat would have enabled him to attend to the \nbusiness himself and so he disliked it and only \ntried to pretend to the steward that he was at- \ntending to it. The steward for his part tried to \npretend to the count that he considered these \nconsultations very valuable for the proprietor \nand troublesome to himself. \n\nIn Kiev Pierre found some people he knew, \nand strangers hastened to make his acquaint- \nance and joyfully welcomed the rich newcomer, \nthe largest landowner of the province. Temp- \ntations to Pierre's greatest weakness the one \nto which he had confessed when admitted to \nthe Lodge were so strong that he could not re- \nsist them. Again whole days, weeks, and months \nof his life passed in as great a rush and were as \nmuch occupied with evening parties, dinners, \nlunches, and balls, giving him no time for re- \n\n\n\n212 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nflection, as in Petersburg. Instead of the new \nlife he had hoped to lead he still lived the old \nlife, only in new surroundings. \n\nOf the three precepts of Freemasonry Pierre \nrealized that he did not fulfill the one which \nenjoined every Mason to set an example of \nmoral life, and that of the seven virtues he \nlacked two morality and the love of death. He \nconsoled himself with the thought that he ful- \nfilled another of the precepts that of reform- \ning the human race and had other virtues- \nlove of his neighbor, and especially generosity. \n\nIn the spring of 1807 he decided to return to \nPetersburg. On the way he intended to visit \nall his estates and see for himself how far his \norders had been carried out and in what state \nwere the serfs whom God had entrusted to his \ncare and whom he intended to benefit. \n\nThe chief steward, who considered the young \ncount's attempts almost insane unprofitable \nto himself, to the count, and to the serfs made \nsome concessions. Continuing to represent the \nliberation of the serfs as impracticable, he ar- \nranged for the erection of large buildings- \nschools, hospitals, and asylums on all the es- \ntates before the master arrived. Everywhere \npreparations were made not for ceremonious \nwelcomes (which he knew Pierre would not \nlike), but for just such gratefully religious ones, \nwith offerings of icons and the bread and salt \nof hospitality, as, according to his understand- \ning of his master, would touch and delude him. \n\nThe southern spring, the comfortable rapid \ntraveling in a Vienna carriage, and the soli- \ntude of the road, all had a gladdening effect on \nPierre. The estates he had not before visited \nwere each more picturesque than the other; \nthe serfs everywhere seemed thriving and touch- \ningly grateful for the benefits conferred on \nthem. Everywhere were receptions, which \nthough they embarrassed Pierre awakened a \njoyful feeling in the depth of his heart. In one \nplace the peasants presented him with bread \nand salt and an icon of Saint Peter and Saint \nPaul, asking permission, as a mark of their \ngratitude for the benefits he had conferred on \nthem, to build a new chantry to the church at \ntheir own expense in honor of Peter and Paul, \nhis patron saints. In another place the women \nwith infants in arms met him to thank him for \nreleasing them from hard work. On a third es- \ntate the priest, bearing a cross, came to meet \nhim surrounded by children whom, by the \ncount's generosity, he was instructing in read- \ning, writing, and religion. On all his estates \nPierre saw with his own eyes brick buildings \n\n\n\nerected or in course of erection, all on one \nplan, for hospitals, schools, and almshouses, \nwhich were soon to be opened. Everywhere he \nsaw the stewards' accounts, according to which \nthe serfs' manorial labor had been diminished, \nand heard the touching thanks of deputations \nof serfs in their full-skirted blue coats. \n\nWhat Pierre did not know was that the place \nwhere they presented him with bread and salt \nand wished to build a chantry in honor of \nPeter and Paul was a market village where a \nfair was held on St. Peter's day, and that the \nrichest peasants (who formed the deputation) \nhad begun the chantry long before, but that \nnine tenths of the peasants in that village were \nin a state of the greatest poverty. He did not \nknow that since the nursing mothers were no \nlonger sent to work on his land, they did still \nharder work on their own land. He did not \nknow that the priest who met him with the \ncross oppressed the peasants by his exactions, \nand that the pupils' parents wept at having to \nlet him take their children and secured their \nrelease by heavy payments. He did not know \nthat the brick buildings, built to plan, were \nbeing built by serfs whose manorial labor was \nthus increased, though lessened on paper. He \ndid not know that where the steward had \nshown him in the accounts that the serfs' pay- \nments had been diminished by a third, their \nobligatory manorial work had been increased \nby a half. And so Pierre was delighted with his \nvisit to his estates and quite recovered the phil- \nanthropic mood in which he had left Peters- \nburg, and wrote enthusiastic letters to his \n"brother-instructor" as he called the Grand \nMaster. \n\n"How easy it is, how little effort it needs, to \ndo so much good," thought Pierre, "and how \nlittle attention we pay to itl" \n\nHe was pleased at the gratitude he received, \nbut felt abashed at receiving it. This gratitude \nreminded him of how much more he might do \nfor these simple, kindly people. \n\nThe chief steward, a very stupid but cun- \nning man who saw perfectly through the nai've \nand intelligent count and played with him as \nwith a toy, seeing the effect these prearranged \nreceptions had on Pierre, pressed him still \nharder with proofs of the impossibility and \nabove all the uselessness of freeing the serfs, \nwho were quite happy as it was. \n\nPierre in his secret soul agreed with the stew- \nard that it would be difficult to imagine hap- \npier people, and that God only knew what \nwould happen to them when they were free, \n\n\n\nBOOK FIVE \n\n\n\nbut he insisted, though reluctantly, on what he \nthought right. The steward promised to do all \nin his power to carry out the count's wishes, \nseeing clearly that not only would the count \nnever be able to find out whether all measures \nhad been taken for the sale of the land and \nforests and to release them from the Land Bank, \nbut would probably never even inquire and \nwould never know that the newly erected build- \nings were standing empty and that the serfs \ncontinued to give in money and work all that \nother people's serfs gave that is to say, all that \ncould be got out of them. \n\nCHAPTER XI \n\nRETURNING FROM his journey through South \nRussia in the happiest state of mind, Pierre \ncarried out an intention he had long had of \nvisiting his friend Bolk6nski, whom he had not \nseen for two years. \n\nBogucharovo lay in a flat uninteresting part \nof the country among fields and forests of fir \nand birch, which were partly cut down. The \nhouse lay behind a newly dug pond filled with \nwater to the brink and with banks still bare of \ngrass. It was at the end of a village that stretched \nalong the highroad in the midst of a young \ncopse in which were a few fir trees. \n\nThe homestead consisted of a threshing floor, \nouthouses, stables, a bathhouse, a lodge, and a \nlarge brick house with semicircular facade still \nin course of construction. Round the house \nwas a garden newly laid out. The fences and \ngates were new and solid; two fire pumps and a \nwater cart, painted green, stood in a shed; the \npaths were straight, the bridges were strong \nand had handrails. Everything bore an impress \nof tidiness and good management. Some do- \nmestic serfs Pierre met, in reply to inquiries as \nto where the prince lived, pointed out a small \nnewly built lodge close to the pond. Ant6n, a \nman who had looked after Prince Andrew in \nhis boyhood, helped Pierre out of his carriage, \nsaid that the prince was at home, and showed \nhim into a clean little anteroom. \n\nPierre was struck by the modesty of the small \nthough clean house after the brilliant surround- \nings in which he had last met his friend in \nPetersburg. \n\nHe quickly entered the small reception room \nwith its sdll-un plastered wooden walls redo- \nlent of pine, and would have gone farther, but \nAnt6n ran ahead on tiptoe and knocked at a \ndoor. \n\n"Well, what is it?" came a sharp, unpleasant \nvoice. \n\n\n\n"A visitor," answered Ant6n. \n\n"Ask him to wait," and the sound was heard \nof a chair being pushed back. \n\nPierre went with rapid steps to the door and \nsuddenly came face to face with Prince An- \ndrew, who came out frowning and looking old. \nPierre embraced him and lifting his spectacles \nkissed his friend on the cheek and looked at \nhim closely. \n\n"Well, I did not expect you, I am very glad," \nsaid Prince Andrew. \n\nPierre said nothing; he looked fixedly at his \nfriend with surprise. He was struck by the \nchange in him. His words were kindly and \nthere was a smile on his lips and face, but his \neyes were dull and lifeless and in spite of his \nevident wish to do so he could not give them a \njoyous and glad sparkle. Prince Andrew had \ngrown thinner, paler, and more manly-looking, \nbut what amazed and estranged Pierre till he \ngot used to it were his inertia and a wrinkle on \nhis brow indicating prolonged concentration \non some one thought. \n\nAs is usually the case with people meeting \nafter a prolonged separation, it was long be- \nfore their conversation could settle on any- \nthing. They put questions and gave brief re- \nplies about things they knew ought to be talked \nover at length. At last the conversation gradu- \nally settled on some of the topics at first lightly \ntouched on: their past life, plans for the fu- \nture, Pierre's journeys and occupations, the \nwar, and so on. The preoccupation and de- \nspondency which Pierre had noticed in his \nfriend's look was now still more clearly ex- \npressed in the smile with which he listened to \nPierre, especially when he spoke with joyful \nanimation of the past or the future. It was as if \nPrince Andrew would have liked to sympathize \nwith what Pierre was saying, but could not. \nThe latter began to feel that it was in bad taste \nto speak of his enthusiasms, dreams, and hopes \nof happiness or goodness, in Prince Andrew's \npresence. He was ashamed to express his new \nMasonic views, which had been particularly re- \nvived and strengthened by his late tour. He \nchecked himself, fearing to seem naive, yet he \nfelt an irresistible desire to show his friend as \nsoon as possible that he was now a quite dif- \nferent, and better, Pierre than he had been in \nPetersburg. \n\n"I can't tell you how much I have lived \nthrough since then. I hardly know myself \nagain." \n\n"Yes, we have altered much, very much, since \nthen," said Prince Andrew. \n\n\n\n214 \n\n"Well, and you? What are your plans?" \n\n"Plans!" repeated Prince Andrew ironically. \n"My plans?" he said, as if astonished at the \nword. "Well, you see, I'm building. I mean to \nsettle here altogether next year " \n\nPierre looked silently and searchingly into \nPrince Andrew's face, which had grown much \nolder. \n\n"No, I meant to ask . . ." Pierre began, but \nPrince Andrew interrupted him. \n\n"But why talk of me? . . . Talk to me, yes, tell \nme about your travels and all you have been \ndoing on your estates." \n\nPierre began describing what he had done \non his estates, trying as far as possible to con- \nceal his own part in the improvements that \nhad been made. Prince Andrew several times \nprompted Pierre's story of what he had been \ndoing, as though it were all an old-time story, \nand he listened not only without interest but \neven as if ashamed of what Pierre was telling \nhim. \n\nPierre felt uncomfortable and even depressed \nin his friend's company and at last became si- \nlent. \n\n"I'll tell you what, my dear fellow," said \nPrince Andrew, who evidently also felt de- \npressed and constrained with his visitor, "I am \nonly bivouacking here and have just come to \nlook round. I am going back to my sister today. \nI will introduce you to her. But of course you \nknow her already," he said, evidently trying to \nentertain a visitor with whom he now found \nnothing in common. "We will go after dinner. \nAnd would you now like to look round my \nplace?" \n\nThey went out and walked about till din- \nnertime, talking of the political news and com- \nmon acquaintances like people who do not \nknow each other intimately. Prince Andrew \nspoke with some animation and interest only \nof the new homestead he was constructing and \nits buildings, but even here, while on the scaf- \nfolding, in the midst of a talk explaining the \nfuture arrangements of the house, he inter- \nrupted himself: \n\n"However, this is not at all interesting. Let \nus have dinner, and then we'll set off." \n\nAt dinner, conversation turned on Pierre's \nmarriage. \n\n"I was very much surprised when I heard \nof it," said Prince Andrew. \n\nPierre blushed, as he always did when it was \nmentioned, and said hurriedly: "I will tell you \nsome time how it all happened. But you know \nit is all over, and forever." \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n" "Forever?" said Prince Andrew. "Nothing's \nforever." \n\n"But you know how it all ended, don't you? \nYou heard of the duel?" \n\n"And so you had to go through that tool" \n\n"One thing I thank God for is that I did not \nkill that man," said Pierre. \n\n"Why so?" asked Prince Andrew. "To kill a \nvicious dog is a very good thing really." \n\n"No, to kill a man is bad wrong." \n\n"Why is it wrong?" urged Prince Andrew. \n"It is not given to man to know what is right \nand what is wrong. Men always did and always \nwill err, and in nothing more than in what \nthey consider right and wrong." \n\n"What does harm to another is wrong," said \nPierre, feeling with pleasure that for the first \ntime since his arrival Prince Andrew was roused, \nhad begun to talk, and wanted to express what \nhad brought him to his present state. \n\n"And who has told you what is bad for an- \nother man?" he asked. \n\n"Bad! Bad!" exclaimed Pierre. "We all know \nwhat is bad for ourselves." \n\n"Yes, we know that, but the harm I am con- \nscious of in myself is something I cannot in- \nflict on others," said Prince Andrew, growing \nmore and more animated and evidently wish- \ning to express his new outlook to Pierre. He \nspoke in French. "I only know two very real evils \nin life: remorse and illness. The only good is \nthe absence of those evils. To live for myself \navoiding those two evils is my whole philoso- \nphy now." \n\n"And love of one's neighbor, and self-sacri- \nfice?" began Pierre. "No, I can't agree with \nyou! To live only so as not to do evil and not \nto have to repent is not enough. I lived like \nthat, I lived for myself and ruined my life. And \nonly now when I am living, or at least trying" \n(Pierre's modesty made him correct himself) \n"to live for others, only now have I understood \nall the happiness of life. No, I shall not agree \nwith you, and you do not really believe what \nyou are saying." Prince Andrew looked silently \nat Pierre with an ironic smile. \n\n"When you sec ,my sister, Princess Mary, \nyou'll get on with her," he said. "Perhaps you \nare right for yourself," he added after a short \npause, "but everyone lives in his own way. You \nlived for yourself and say you nearly ruined \nyour life and only found happiness when you \nbegan living for others. I experienced just the \nreverse. I lived for glory. And after all what is \nglory? The same love of others, a desire to do \nsomething for them, a desire for their approv- \n\n\n\nBOOK FIVE \n\n\n\n215 \n\n\n\nal. So I lived for others, and not almost, but \nquite, ruined my life. And I have become calm- \ner since I began to live only for myself." \n\n"But what do you mean by living only for \nyourself?" asked Pierre, growing excited. \n"What about your son, your sister, and your \nfather?" \n\n"But that's just the same as myself they are \nnot others" explained Prince Andrew. "The \nothers, one's neighbors, le prochain, as you and \nPrincess Mary call it, are the chief source of \nall error and evil. Le prochain your Kiev \npeasants to whom you want to do good." \n\nAnd he looked at Pierre with a mocking, \nchallenging expression. He evidently wished \nto draw him on. \n\n"You are joking," replied Pierre, growing \nmore and more excited. "What error or evil \ncan there be in my wishing to do good, and \neven doing a littlethough I did very little and \ndid it very badly? What evil can there be in it \nif unfortunate people, our serfs, people like \nourselves, were growing up and dying with no \nidea of God and truth beyond ceremonies and \nmeaningless prayers and are now instructed in \na comforting belief in future life, retribution, \nrecompense, and consolation? What evil and \nerror are there in it, if people were dying of \ndisease without help while material assistance \ncould so easily be rendered, and I supplied \nthem with a doctor, a hospital, and an asylum \nfor the aged? And is it not a palpable, unques- \ntionable good if a peasant, or a woman with a \nbaby, has no rest day or night and I give them \nrest and leisure?" said Pierre, hurrying and \nlisping. "And I have done that though badly \nand to a small extent; but I have done some- \nthing toward it and you cannot persuade me \nthat it was not a good action, and more than \nthat, you can't make me believe that you do \nnot think so yourself. And the main thing is," \nhe continued, "that I know, and know for cer- \ntain, that the enjoyment of doing this good is \nthe only sure happiness in life." \n\n"Yes, if you put it like that it's quite a dif- \nferent matter," said Prince Andrew. "I build a \nhouse and lay out a garden, and you build \nhospitals. The one and the other may serve as \na pastime. But what's right and what's good \nmust be judged by one who knows all, but not \nby us. Well, you want an argument," he added, \n"come on then." \n\nThey rose from the table and sat down in \nthe entrance porch which served as a veranda. \n\n"Come, let's argue then," said Prince An- \ndrew. "You talk of schools," he went on, crook- \n\n\n\ning a finger, "education and so forth; that is, \nyou want to raise him" (pointing to a peasant \nwho passed by them taking off his cap) "from \nhis animal condition and awaken in him spir- \nitual needs, while it seems to me that animal \nhappiness is the only happiness possible, and \nthat is just what you want to deprive him of. I \nenvy him, but you want to make him what I \nam, without giving him my means. Then you \nsay, 'lighten his toil.' But as I see it, physical \nlabor is as essential to him, as much a condi- \ntion of his existence, as mental activity is to \nyou or me. You can't help thinking. I go to bed \nafter two in the morning, thoughts come and \nI can't sleep but toss about till dawn, because \nI think and can't help thinking, just as he \ncan't help plowing and mowing; if he didn't, \nhe would go to the drink shop or fall ill. Just \nas I could not stand his terrible physical labor \nbut should die of it in a week, so he could not \nstand my physical idleness, but would grow \nfat and die. The third thing what else was it \nyou talked about?" and Prince Andrew crooked \na third finger. "Ah, yes, hospitals, medicine. \nHe has a fit, he is dying, and you come and \nbleed him and patch him up. He will drag \nabout as a cripple, a burden to everybody, for \nanother ten years. It would be far easier and \nsimpler for him to die. Others are being born \nand there are plenty of them as it is. It would \nbe different if you grudged losing a laborer \nthat's how I regard him but you want to cure \nhim from love of him. And he does not want \nthat. And besides, what a notion that medicine \never cured anyonel Killed them, yes!" said he, \nfrowning angrily and turning away from Pierre. \n\nPrince Andrew expressed his ideas so clearly \nand distinctly that it was evident he had re- \nflected on this subject more than once, and he \nspoke readily and rapidly like a man who has \nnot talked for a long time. His glance became \nmore animated as his conclusions became more \nhopeless. \n\n"Oh, that is dreadful, dreadful!" said Pierre. \n"I don't understand how one can live with \nsuch ideas. I had such moments myself not long \nago, in Moscow and when traveling, but at \nsuch times I collapsed so that I don't live at all \neverything seems hateful to me . . . myself \nmost of all. Then I don't eat, don't wash . . . \nand how is it with you? . . ." \n\n"Why not wash? That is not cleanly," said \nPrince Andrew; "on the contrary one must try \nto make one's life as pleasant as possible. I'm \nalive, that is not my fault, so I must live out \nmy life as best I can without hurting others." \n\n\n\n2l6 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\n"But with such ideas what motive have you \nfor living? One would sit without moving, un- \ndertaking nothing " \n\n"Life as it is leaves one no peace. I should be \nthankful to do nothing, but here on the one \nhand the local nobility have done me the hon- \nor to choose me to be their marshal; it was all \nI could do to get out of it. They could not un- \nderstand that I have not the necessary qualifi- \ncations for it the kind of good-natured, fussy \nshallowness necessary for the position. Then \nthere's this house, which must be built in or- \nder to have a nook of one's own in which to be \nquiet. And now there's this recruiting." \n\n"Why aren't you serving in the army?" \n\n"After Austerlitz!" said Prince Andrew \ngloomily. "No, thank you very much! I have \npromised myself not to serve again in the ac- \ntive Russian army. And I won't not even if \nBonaparte were here at Smolensk threatening \nBald Hills even then I wouldn't serve in the \nRussian armyl Well, as I was saying," he con- \ntinued, recovering his composure, "now there's \nthis recruiting. My father is chief in command \nof the Third District, and my only way of \navoiding active service is to serve under him." \n\n"Then you are serving?" \n\n"I am." \n\nHe paused a little while. \n\n"And why do you serve?" \n\n"Why, for this reason! My father is one of \nthe most remarkable men of his time. But he \nis growing old, and though not exactly cruel \nhe has too energetic a character. He is so ac- \ncustomed to unlimited power that he is terri- \nble, and now he has this authority of a com- \nmander in chief of the recruiting, granted by \nthe Emperor. If I had been two hours late a \nfortnight ago he would have had a paymaster's \nclerk at Yiikhnovna hanged," said Prince An- \ndrew with a smile. "So I am serving because I \nalone have any influence with my father, and \nnow and then can save him from actions which \nwould torment him afterwards." \n\n"Well, there you see!" \n\n"Yes, but it is not as you imagine," Prince \nAndrew continued. "I did not, and do not, in \nthe least care about that scoundrel of a clerk \nwho had stolen some boots from the recruits; \nI should even have been very glad to see him \nhanged, but I was sorry for my father that \nagain is for myself." \n\nPrince Andrew grew more and more ani- \nmated. His eyes glittered feverishly while he \ntried to prove to Pierre that in his actions there \nwas no desire to do good to his neighbor. \n\n\n\n"There now, you wish to liberate your serfs," \nhe continued; "that is a very good thing, but \nnot for you I don't suppose you ever had any- \none flogged or sent to Siberia and still less for \nyour serfs. If they are beaten, flogged, or sent \nto Siberia, I don't suppose they are any the \nworse off. In Siberia they lead the same animal \nlife, and the stripes on their bodies heal, and \nthey are happy as before. But it is a good thing \nfor proprietors who perish morally, bring re- \nmorse upon themselves, stifle this remorse and \ngrow callous, as a result of being able to inflict \npunishments justly and unjustly. It is those peo- \nple I pity, and for their sake I should like to \nliberate the serfs. You may not have seen, but I \nhave seen, how good men brought up in those \ntraditions of unlimited power, in time when \nthey grow more irritable, become cruel and \nharsh, are conscious of it, but cannot restrain \nthemselves and grow more and more misera- \nble." \n\nPrince Andrew spoke so earnestly that Pierre \ncould not help thinking that these thoughts \nhad been suggested to Prince Andrew by his \nfather's case. \n\nHe did not reply. \n\n"So that's what I'm sorry for human dignity, \npeace of mind, purity, arid not the serfs' backs \nand foreheads, which, beat and shave as you \nmay, always remain the same backs and fore- \nheads." \n\n"No, no! A thousand times no! I shall never \nagree with you," said Pierre. \n\nCHAPTER XII \n\nIN THE EVENING Andrew and Pierre got into the \nopen carriage and drove to Bald Hills. Prince \nAndrew, glancing at Pierre, broke the silence \nnow and then with remarks which showed that \nhe was in a good temper. \n\nPointing to the fields, he spoke of the im- \nprovements he was making in his husbandry. \n\nPierre remained gloomily silent, answering \nin monosyllables and apparently immersed in \nhis own thoughts. \n\nHe was thinking that Prince Andrew was \nunhappy, had gone astray, did not see the true \nlight, and that he, Pierre, ought to aid, en- \nlighten, and raise him. But as soon as he \nthought of what he should say, he felt that \nPrince Andrew with one word, one argument, \nwould upset all his teaching, and he shrank \nfrom beginning, afraid of exposing to possible \nridicule what to him was precious and sacred. \n\n"No, but why do you think so?" Pierre sud- \ndenly began, lowering his head and looking \n\n\n\nBOOK FIVE \n\n\n\n217 \n\n\n\nlike a bull about to charge, "why do you think \nso? You should not think so." \n\n"Think? What about?" asked Prince Andrew \nwith surprise. \n\n"About life, about man's destiny. It can't be \nso. I myself thought like that, and do you know \nwhat saved me? Freemasonry! No, don't smile. \nFreemasonry is not a religious ceremonial sect, \nas I thought it was: Freemasonry is the best ex- \npression of the best, the eternal, aspects of hu- \nmanity." \n\nAnd he began to explain Freemasonry as he \nunderstood it to Prince Andrew. He said that \nFreemasonry is the teaching of Christianity \nfreed from the bonds of State and Church, a \nteaching of equality, brotherhood, and love. \n\n"Only our holy brotherhood has the real \nmeaning of life, all the rest is a dream," said \nPierre. "Understand, my dear fellow, that out- \nside this union all is filled with deceit and \nfalsehood and I agree with you that nothing is \nleft for an intelligent and good man but to \nlive out his life, like you, merely trying not to \nharm others. But make our fundamental con- \nvictions your own, join our brotherhood, give \nyourself up to us, let yourself be guided, and \nyou will at once feel yourself, as I have felt my- \nself, a part of that vast invisible chain the be- \nginning of which is hidden in heaven," said \nPierre. \n\nPrince Andrew, looking straight in front of \nhim, listened in silence to Pierre's words. More \nthan once, when the noise of the wheels pre- \nvented his catching wliat Pierre said, he asked \nhim to repeat it, and by the peculiar glow that \ncame into Prince Andrew's eyes and by his \nsilence, Pierre saw that his words were not in \nvain and that Prince Andrew would not in- \nterrupt him or laugh at what he said. \n\nThey reached a river that had overflowed its \nbanks and which they had to cross by ferry. \nWhile the carriage and horses were beingplaced \non it, they also stepped on the raft. \n\nPrince Andrew, leaning his arms on the raft \nrailing, gazed silently at the flooding waters \nglittering in the setting sun. \n\n"Well, what do you think about it?" Pierre \nasked. "Why are you silent?" \n\n"What do I think about it? I am listening to \nyou. It's all very well. . . . You say: join our \nbrotherhood and we will show you the aim of \nlife, the destiny of man, and the laws which gov- \nern the world. But who are we? Men. How is it \nyou know everything? Why do I alone not see \nwhat you see? You see a reign of goodness and \ntruth on earth, but I don't see it." \n\n\n\nPierre interrupted him. \n\n"Do you believe in a future life?" he asked. \n\n"A futurelife?" Prince Andrew repeated, but \nPierre, giving him no time to reply, took the \nrepetition for a denial, the more readily as he \nknew Prince Andrew's former atheistic con- \nvictions. \n\n"You say you can't see a reign of goodness \nand truth on earth. Nor could I, and it can- \nnot be seen if one looks on our life here as the \nend of everything. On earth f here on this earth" \n(Pierre pointed to the fields), "there is no \ntruth, all is false and evil; but in the universe, \nin the whole universe, there is a kingdom of \ntruth, and we who are now the children of \nearth are eternallychildren of the whole uni- \nverse. Don't I feel in my soul that I am part of \nthis vast harmonious whole? Don't I feel that \nI form one link, one step, between the lower \nand higher beings, in this vast harmonious mul- \ntitude of beings in whom the Deity the Su- \npreme Power if you prefer the term is mani- \nfest? If I see, clearly see, that ladder leading \nfrom plant to man, why should I suppose it \nbreaks off at me and does not go farther and \nfarther? I feel that I cannot vanish, since noth- \ning vanishes in this world, but that I shall al- \nways exist and always have existed. I feel that \nbeyond me and above me there are spirits, and \nthat in this world there is truth." \n\n"Yes, that is Herder's theory," said Prince \nAndrew, "but it is not that which can convince \nme, dear friend life and death are what con- \nvince. What convinces is when one sees a be- \ning dear to one, bound up with one's own life, \nbefore whom one was to blame and had hoped \nto make it right" (Prince Andrew's voice trem- \nbled and he turned away), "and suddenly that \nbeing is seized with pain, suffers, and ceases to \nexist. . . . Why? It cannot be that there is no \n\nanswer. And I believe there is That's what \n\nconvinces, that is what has convinced me," said \nPrince Andrew. \n\n"Yes, yes, of course," said Pierre, "isn't that \nwhat I'm saying?" \n\n"No. All I say is that it is not argument that \nconvinces me of the necessity of a future life, \nbut this: when you go hand in hand with some- \none and all at once that person vanishes there, \ninto nowhere, and you yourself are left facing \nthat abyss, and look in. And I have looked \nin. . . ." \n\n"Well, that's it then! You know that there is \na there and there is a Someone? There is the \nfuture life. The Someone is God." \n\nPrince Andrew did not reply. The carriage \n\n\n\n2l8 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nand horses had long since been taken off, onto \nthe farther bank, and reharnessed. The sun \nhad sunk half below the horizon and an eve- \nning frost was starring the puddles near the fer- \nry, but Pierre and Andrew, to the astonishment \nof the footmen, coachmen, and ferrymen, still \nstood on the raft and talked. \n\n"If there is a God and future life, there is \ntruth and good, and man's highest happiness \nconsists in striving to attain them. We must \nlive, we must love, and we must believe that we \nlive not only today on this scrap of earth, but \nhave lived and shall live forever, there, in the \nWhole," said Pierre, and he pointed to the sky. \n\nPrince Andrew stood leaning on the railing \nof theraft listening to Pierre, and he gazed with \nhis eyes fixed on the red reflection of the sun \ngleaming on the blue waters. There was per- \nfect stillness. Pierre became silent. The raft had \nlong since stopped and only the waves of the \ncurrent beat softly against it below. Prince An- \ndrew felt as if the sound of the waves kept up \na refrain to Pierre's words, whispering: \n\n"It is true, believe it." \n\nHe sighed, and glanced with a radiant, child- \nlike, tender look at Pierre's face, flushed and \nrapturous, but yet shy before his superior \nfriend. \n\n"Yes, if it only were sol "said Prince Andrew. \n"However, it is time to get on," he added, and, \nstepping off the raft, he looked up at the sky \nto which Pierre had pointed, and for the first \ntime since Austerlitz saw that high, everlasting \nsky he had seen while lying on that battlefield; \nand something that had long been slumbering, \nsomething that was best within him, sudden- \nly awoke, joyful and youthful, in his soul. It \nvanished as soon as he returned to the custom- \nary conditions of his life, but he knew that this \nfeeling which he did not know how to develop \nexisted within him. His meeting with Pierre \nformed an epoch in Prince Andrew's life. \nThough outwardly he continued to live in the \nsame old way, inwardly he began a new life. \n\nCHAPTER XIII \n\nIT WAS getting dusk when Prince Andrew and \nPierre drove up to the front entrance of the \nhouse at Bald Hills. As they approached the \nhouse, Prince Andrew with a smile drew Pierre's \nattention to a commotion going on at the back \nporch. A woman, bent with age, with a wallet \non her back, and a short, long-haired, young \nman in a black garment had rushed back to the \ngate on seeing the carriage driving up. Two \nwomen ran out after them, and all four, look- \n\n\n\ning round at the carriage, ran in dismay up the \nsteps of the back porch. \n\n"Those are Mary's 'God's folk,' " said Prince \nAndrew. "They have mistaken us for my father. \nThis is the one matter in which she disobeys \nhim. He orders these pilgrims to be driven \naway, but she receives them." \n\n"But what are 'God's folk'?" asked Pierre. \n\nPrince Andrew had no time to answer. The \nservants came out to meet them, and he asked \nwhere the old prince was and whether he was \nexpected back soon. \n\nThe old prince had gone to the town and was \nexpected back any minute. \n\nPrince Andrew led Pierre to his own apart- \nments, which were always kept in perfect order \nand readiness for him in his father's house; he \nhimself went to the nursery. \n\n"Let us go and see my sister," he said to \nPierre when he returned. "I have not found \nher yet, she is hiding now, sitting with her \n'God's folk.' It will serve her right, she will be \nconfused, but you will see her 'God's folk.' It's \nreally very curious." \n\n"What are 'God's folk'?" asked Pierre. \n\n"Come, and you'll see for yourself." \n\nPrincess Mary really was disconcerted and \nred patches came on her face when they went \nin. In her snug room, with lamps burning be- \nfore the icon stand, a young lad with a long \nnose and long hair, wearing a monk's cassock, \nsat on the sofa beside her, behind a samovar. \nNear them, in an armchair, sat a thin, shriveled, \nold woman, with a meek expression on her \nchildlike face. \n\n"Andrew, why didn't you warn me?" said the \nprincess, with mild reproach, as she stood be- \nfore her pilgrims like a hen before her chick- \nens. \n\n"Charmde de vous voir. Je suis trs contente \nde vous voir" l she said to Pierre as he kissed \nher hand. She had known him as a child, and \nnow his friendship with Andrew, his misfor- \ntune with his wife, and above all his kindly, \nsimple face disposed her favorably toward him. \nShe looked at him with her beautiful radiant \neyes and seemed to say, "I like you very much, \nbut please don't laugh at my people." After \nexchanging the first greetings, they sat down. \n\n"Ah, and Ivdnushka is here tool" said Prince \nAndrew, glancing with a smile at the young \npilgrim. \n\n"Andrew!" said Princess Mary, imploringly. \n"// faut que vous sachiez que c'cst une \n\n1 "Delighted to see you. I am very glad to sec \nyou." \n\n\n\nBOOK FIVE \n\n\n\n219 \n\n\n\nfcmme" l said Prince Andrew to Pierre. \n\n"Andrew, au nom de Dieu!" a Princess Mary \nrepeated. \n\nIt was evident that Prince Andrew's ironical \ntone toward the pilgrims and Princess Mary's \nhelpless attempts to protect them were their \ncustomary long-established relations on the \nmatter. \n\n"Maw, ma bonne ami*/' said Prince Andrew, \n"vous devriez au contraire m'Stre reconnais- \nsante de ce que j'explique d Pierre votre inti- \nmite 1 avec ce jeune homme" * \n\n"Really?" said Pierre, gazing over his spec- \ntacles with curiosity and seriousness (forwhich \nPrincess Mary was specially grateful to him) \ninto Ivanushka's face, who, seeing that she was \nbeing spoken about, looked round at them all \nwith crafty eyes. \n\nPrincess Mary's embarrassment on her peo- \nple's account was quite unnecessary. They were \nnot in the least abashed. The old woman, low- \nering her eyes but casting side glances at the \nnewcomers, had turned her cup upside down \nand placed a nibbled bit of sugar beside it, and \nsat quietly in her armchair, though hoping to \nbe offered another cup of tea. Ivdnushka, sip- \nping out of her saucer, looked with sly woman- \nish eyes from under her brows at the young \nmen. \n\n"Where have you been? To Kiev?" Prince \nAndrew asked the old woman. \n\n"I have, good sir," she answered garrulously. \n"Just at Christmastime I was deemed worthy to \npartake of the holy and heavenly sacrament at \nthe shrine of the saint. And now I'm from Kol- \nyzin, master, where a great and wonderful \nblessing has been revealed." \n\n"And was Ivanushka with you?" \n\n"I go by myself, benefactor," said Ivdnushka, \ntrying to speak in a bass voice. "I only came \nacross Pelage*ya in Yiikhnovo. . . ." \n\nPelage*ya interrupted her companion; she \nevidently wished to tell what she had seen. \n\n"In Kolydzin, master, a wonderful blessing \nhas been revealed." \n\n"What is it? Some new relics?" asked Prince \nAndrew. \n\n"Andrew, do leave off," said Princess Mary. \n"Don't tell him, Pelagya." \n\n"No . . . why not, my dear, why shouldn't I? \nI like him. He is kind, he is one of God's cho- \n\n1 "You must know that this is a woman." \n\n* "For heaven's sake." \n\n* "But, my dear, you ought on the contrary to be \ngrateful to me for explaining to Pierre your inti- \nmacy with this young man." \n\n\n\nsen, he's a benefactor, he once gave me ten ru- \nbles, I remember. When I was in Kiev, Crazy \nCyril says to me (he's one of God's own and \ngoes barefoot summer and winter), he says, \n'Why are you not going to the right place? Go \nto Kolyizin where a wonder-working icon of \nthe Holy Mother of God has been revealed.' \nOn hearing those words I said good-by to the \nholy folk and went." \n\nAll were silent, only the pilgrim woman \nwent on in measured tones, drawing in her \nbreath. \n\n"So I come, master, and the people say tome: \n'A great blessing has been revealed, holy oil \ntrickles from the cheeks of our blessed Mother, \nthe Holy Virgin Mother of God.' . . ." \n\n"All right, all right, you can tell us after- \nwards," said Princess Mary, flushing. \n\n"Let me ask her," said Pierre. "Did you see \nit yourselves?" he inquired. \n\n"Oh, yes, master, I was found worthy. Such a \nbrightness on the face like the light of heaven, \nand from the blessed Mother's cheek it drops \nand drops. . . ." \n\n"But, dear me, that must be a fraud!" said \nPierre, naively, who had listened attentively to \nthe pilgrim. \n\n"Oh, master, what are you say ing?" exclaimed \nthe horrified Pelage* ya, turn ing to Princess Mary \nfor support. \n\n"They impose on the people," he repeated. \n\n"Lord Jesus Christ!" exclaimed the pilgrim \nWoman, crossing herself. "Oh, don't speak so, \nmaster 1 There was a general who did not be- \nlieve, and said, 'The monks cheat,' and as soon \nas he'd said it he went blind. And he dreamed \nthat the Holy Virgin Mother of the Kiev cata- \ncombs came to him and said, 'Believe in meand \nI will make you whole.' So he begged: 'Take \nme to her, take me to her.' It's the real truth \nI'm telling you, I saw it myself. So he was \nbrought, quite blind, straight to her, and he \ngoes up to her and falls down and says, 'Make \nme whole,' says he, 'and I'll give thee what the \nTsar bestowed on me.' I saw it myself, master, \nthe star is fixed into the icon. Well, and what \ndo you think? He received his sight! It's a sin \nto speak so. God will punish you," she said ad- \nmonishingly, turning to Pierre. \n\n"How did the star get into the icon?" Pierre \nasked. \n\n"And was the Holy Mother promoted to the \nrank of general?" said Prince Andrew, with a \nsmile. \n\nPelagc*ya suddenly grew quite pale and \nclasped her hands. \n\n\n\n220 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\n"Oh, master, master, what a sin! And you \nwho have a son I" she began, her pallor sud- \ndenly turning to a vivid red. "Master, what \nhave you said? God forgive you!" And she \ncrossed herself. "Lord forgive him! My dear, \nwhat does it mean? . . ." she asked, turning to \nPrincess Mary. She got up and, almost crying, \nbegan to arrange her wallet. She evidently felt \nfrightened and ashamed to have accepted char- \nity in a house where such things could be said, \nand was at the same time sorry to have now to \nforgo the charity of this house. \n\n"Now, why need you do it?" said Princess \nMary. "Why did you come to me? . . ." \n\n"Come, Pelagdya, I was joking," said Pierre. \n"Princesse, ma parole, je n'ai pas voulu Voffen- \njer. 1 1 did not mean anything, I wasonlyjoking," \nhe said, smiling shyly and trying to efface his \noffense. "It was all my fault, and Andrew was \nonly joking." \n\nPelag^ya stopped doubtfully, but in Pierre's \nface there was such a look of sincere penitence, \nand Prince Andrew glanced so meekly now at \nher and now at Pierre, that she was gradually \nreassured. \n\nCHAPTER XIV \n\nTHE PILGRIM WOMAN was appeased and, being \nencouraged to talk, gave a long account of Fa- \nther Amphilochus, who led so holy a life that \nhis hands smelled of incense, and how on her \nlast visit to Kiev some monks she knew let her \nhave the keys of the catacombs, and how she, \ntaking some dried bread with her, had spent \ntwo days in the catacombs with the saints. "I'd \npray awhile to one, ponder awhile, then go on \nto another. I'd sleep a bit and then again go \nand kiss the relics, and there was such peace all \naround, such blessedness, that one don't want \nto come out, even into the light of heaven \nagain." \n\nPierre listened to her attentively and serious- \nly. Prince Andrew went out of the room, and \nthen, leaving "God's folk" to finish their tea, \nPrincess Mary took Pierre into the drawing \nroom. \n\n"You are very kind," she said to him. \n\n"Oh, I really did not mean to hurt her feel- \nings. I understand them so well and have the \ngreatest respect for them." \n\nPrincess Mary looked at him silently and \nsmiled affectionately. \n\n"I have known you a long time, you see, and \nam as fond of you as of a brother," she said. \n\n1 "Princess, on my word, I did not wish to offend \nher/' \n\n\n\n"How do you find Andrew?" she added hur- \nriedly, not giving him time to reply to her af- \nfectionate words. "I am very anxious about \nhim. His health was better in the winter, but \nlast spring his wound reopened and the doctor \nsaid he ought to go away for a cure. And I am \nalso very much afraid for him spiritually. He \nhas not a character like us women who, when \nwe suffer, can weep away our sorrows. He keeps \nit all within him. Today he is cheerful and in \ngood spirits, but that is the effect of your visit \nhe is not often like that. If you could per- \nsuade him to go abroad. He needs activity, and \nthis quiet regular life is very bad for him. Oth- \ners don't notice it, but I see it." \n\nToward ten o'clock the menservants rushed \nto the front door, hearing the bells of the old \nprince's carriage approaching. Prince Andrew \nand Pierre also went out into the porch. \n\n"Who's that?" asked the old prince, notic- \ning Pierre as he got out of the carriage. \n\n"Ah! Very glad! Kiss me," he said, having \nlearned who the young stranger was. \n\nThe old prince was in a good temper and \nvery gracious to Pierre. \n\nBefore supper, Prince Andrew, coming back \nto his father's study, found him disputing hot- \nly with his visitor. Pierre was maintaining that \na time would come when there would be no \nmore wars. The old prince disputed it chaffing- \nly, but without getting angry. \n\n"Drain the blood from men's veins and put \nin water instead, then there will be no more \nwar! Old women's nonsense old women's \nnonsense!" he repeated, but still he patted \nPierre affectionately on the shoulder, and then \nwent up to the table where Prince Andrew, ev- \nidently not wishing to join in the conversation, \nwas looking over the papers his father had \nbrought from town. The old prince went up to \nhim and began to talk business. \n\n"The marshal, a Count Rost6v, hasn't sent \nhalf his contingent. He came to town and \nwanted to invite me to dinner I gave him a \npretty dinner! . . . And there, look at this. . . . \nWell, my boy," the old prince went on, address- \ning his son and patting Pierre on the shoulder. \n"A fine fellow your friend I like him! He \nstirs me up. Another says clever things and one \ndoesn't care to listen, but this one talks rub- \nbish yet stirs an old fellow up. Well, go! Get \nalong! Perhaps I'll come and sit with you at \nsupper. We'll have another dispute. Make \nfriends with my little fool, Princess Mary," he \nshouted after Pierre, through the door. \n\nOnly now, on his visit to Bald Hills, did \n\n\n\nBOOK FIVE \n\n\n\nPierre fully realize the strength and charm of \nhis friendship with Prince Andrew. That charm \nwas not expressed so much in his relations with \nhim as with all his family and with the house- \nhold. With the stern old prince and the gen- \ntle, timid Princess Mary, though he had scarce- \nly known them, Pierre at once felt like an old \nfriend. They were all fond of him already. Not \nonly Princess Mary, who had been won by his \ngentleness with the pilgrims, gave him her most \nradiant looks, but even the one-year-old "Prince \nNicholas" (as his grandfather called him) \nsmiled at Pierre and let himself be taken in his \narms, and Michael Ivdnovich and Mademoi- \nselle Bourienne looked at him with pleasant \nsmiles when he talked to the old prince. \n\nThe old prince came in to supper; this was \nevidently on Pierre's account. And during the \ntwo days of the young man's visit he was ex- \ntremely kind to him and told him to visit them \nagain. \n\nWhen Pierre had gone and the members of \nthe household met together, they began to ex- \nprtss their opinions of him as people always \ndo after a new acquaintance has left, but as \nseldom happens, no one said anything but \nwhat was good of him. \n\nCHAPTER XV \n\nWHEN RETURNING from his leave, Rostov felt, \nfor the first time, how close was the bond that \nunited him to Denfsovand the whole regiment. \n\nOn approaching it, Rost6v felt as he had \ndone when approaching his home in Moscow. \nWhen he saw the first hussar with the unbut- \ntoned uniform of his regiment, when he rec- \nognized red-haired Dem^ntyev and saw the \npicket ropes of the roan horses, when Lavru- \nshka gleefully shouted to his master, "The \ncount has cornel" and Denfsov, who had been \nasleep on his bed, ran all disheveled out of the \nmud hut to embrace him, and the officers col- \nlected round to greet the new arrival, Rostov \nexperienced the same feeling as when his moth- \ner, his father, and his sister had embraced him, \nand tears of joy choked him so that he could \nnot speak. The regiment was also a home, and \nas unalterably dear and precious as his parents' \nhouse. \n\nWhen he had reported himself to the com- \nmander of the regiment and had been reas- \nsigned to his former squadron, had been on \nduty and had gone out foraging, when he had \nagain entered into all the little interests of the \nregiment and felt himself deprived of liberty \nand bound in one narrow, unchanging frame, \n\n\n\nhe experienced the same sense of peace, of mor- \nal support, and the same senseof being at home \nhere in his own place, as he had felt under the \nparental roof. But here was none of all that \nturmoil of the world at large, where he did not \nknow his right place and took mistaken deci- \nsions; here was no ScSnya with whom he ought, \nor ought not, to have an explanation; here was \nno possibility of going there or not going there; \nhere there were not twenty- four hours in the \nday which could be spent in such a variety of \nways; there was not that innumerable crowd of \npeople of whom not one was nearer to him or \nfarther from him than another; there were \nnone of those uncertain and undefined money \nrelations with his father, and nothing to recall \nthat terrible loss to D61okhov. Here, in the reg- \niment, all was clear and simple. The whole \nworld was divided into two unequal parts: one, \nour Pdvlograd regiment; the other, all the rest. \nAnd the rest was no concern of his. In the regi- \nment, everything was definite: who was lieu- \ntenant, who captain, who was a good fellow, \nwho a bad one, and most of all, who was a com- \nrade. The canteenkeeper gave one credit, one's \npay came every four months, there was nothing \nto think out or decide, you had only to do noth- \ning that was considered bad in the Pavlograd \nregiment and, when given an order, to do what \nwas clearly, distinctly, and definitely ordered \nand all would be well. \n\nHaving once more entered into the definite \nconditions of this regimental life, Rost6v felt \nthe joy and relief a tired man feels on lying \ndown to rest. Life in the regiment, during this \ncampaign, was all the pleasanter for him, be- \ncause, after his loss to D61okhov (for which, in \nspite of all his family's efforts to console him, \nhe could not forgive himself), he had made up \nhis mind to atone for his fault by serving, not \nas he had done before, but really well, and by \nbeing a perfectly first-rate comrade and officer \nin a word, a splendid man altogether, a thing \nwhich seemed so difficult out in the world, but \nso possible in the regiment. \n\nAfter his losses, he had determined to pay \nback his debt to his parents in five years. He re- \nceived ten thousand rubles a year, but now re- \nsolved to take only two thousand and leave the \nrest to repay the debt to his parents. \n\nOur army, after repeated retreats and ad- \nvances and battles at Pultiisk and Preussisch- \nEylau, was concentrated near Bartenstein. It \nwas awaiting the Emperor's arrival and the be- \nginning of a new campaign. \n\nThe Pdvlograd regiment, belonging to that \n\n\n\n22* \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\npart of the army which had served in the 1805 \ncampaign, had been recruiting up to strength \nin Russia, and arrived too late to take part in \nthe first actions of the campaign. It had been \nneither at Pultusk nor at Preussisch-Eylau and, \nwhen it joined the army in the field in the sec- \nond half of the campaign, was attached to Pld- \ntov's division. \n\nPldtov's division was acting independently \nof the main army. Several times parts of the \nPdvlograd regiment had exchanged shots with \nthe enemy, had taken prisoners, and once had \neven captured Marshal Oudinot's carriages. In \nApril the Pdvlograds were stationed immova- \nbly for some weeks near a totally ruined and \ndeserted German village. \n\nA thaw had set in, it was muddy and cold, \nthe ice on the river broke, and the roads be- \ncame impassable. For days neither provisions \nfor the men nor fodder for the horses had been \nissued. As no transports could arrive, the men \ndispersed about the abandoned and deserted \nvillages, searching for potatoes, but found few \neven of these. \n\nEverything had been eaten up and the in- \nhabitants had all fled if any remained, they \nwere worse than beggars and nothing more \ncould be taken from them; even the soldiers, \nusually pitiless enough, instead of taking any- \nthing from them, often gave them the last of \ntheir rations. \n\nThe Pdvlograd regiment had had only two \nmen wounded in action, but had lost nearly half \nits men from hunger and sickness. In the hos- \npitals, death was so certain that soldiers suffer- \ning from fever, or the swelling that came from \nbad food, preferred to remain on duty, and \nhardly able to drag their legs went to the front \nrather than to the hospitals. When spring came \non, the soldiers found a plant just showing out \nof the ground that looked like asparagus, which, \nfor some. reason, they called "Mdshka's sweet \nroot." It was very bitter, but they wandered \nabout the fields seeking it and dug it out with \ntheir sabers and ate it, though they were or- \ndered not to do so, as it was a noxious plant. \nThat spring a new disease broke out among the \nsoldiers, a swelling of the arms, legs, and face, \nwhich the doctors attributed to eating this root. \nBut in spite of all this, the soldiers of Denisov's \nsquadron fed chiefly on "Mdshka's sweet root," \nbecause it was the second week that the last of \nthe biscuits were being doled out at the rate of \nhalf a pound a man and the last potatoes re- \nceived had sprouted and frozen. \n\nThe horses also had been fed for a fortnight \n\n\n\non straw from the thatched roofs and had be- \ncome terribly thin, though still covered with \ntufts of felty winter hair. \n\nDespite this destitution, the soldiers and of- \nficers went on living just as usual. Despite their \npale swollen faces and tattered uniforms, the \nhussars formed line for roll call, kept things in \norder, groomed their horses, polished their \narms, brought in straw from the thatched roofs \nin place of fodder, and sat down to dine round \nthe caldrons from which they rose up hungry, \njoking about their nasty food and their hunger. \nAs usual, in their spare time, they lit bonfires, \nsteamed themselves before them naked; \nsmoked, picked out and baked sprouting rot- \nten potatoes, told and listened to stories of Po- \ntdmkin's and Suv6rov's campaigns, or to leg- \nends of Alesha the Sly, or the priest's laborer \nMik61ka. \n\nThe officers, as usual, lived in twos and threes \nin the roofless, half-ruined houses. The seniors \ntried to collect straw and potatoes and, in gen- \neral, food for the men. The younger ones oc- \ncupied themselves as before, some playing cards \n(there was plenty of money, though there was \nno food), some with more innocent games, such \nas quoits and skittles. The general trend of \nthe campaign was rarely spoken of, partly be- \ncause nothing certain was known about it, \npartly because there was a vague feeling that \nin the main it was going badly. \n\nRost6v lived, as before, with Denfsov, and \nsince their furlough they had become more \nfriendly than ever. Denisov never spoke of Ros- \ntov's family, but by the tender friendship his \ncommander showed him, Rost6v felt that the \nelder hussar's luckless love for Natdsha played \na part in strengthening their friendship. Den- \nfsov evidently tried to expose Rost6v to dan- \nger as seldom as possible, and after an action \ngreeted his safe return with evident joy. On \none of his foraging expeditions, in a deserted \nand ruined village to which he had come in \nsearch of provisions, Rost6v found a family \nconsisting of an old Pole and his daughter with \nan infant in arms. They were half clad, hungry, \ntoo weak to get away on foot and had no means \nof obtaining a conveyance. Rost6v brought \nthem to his quarters, placed them in his own \nlodging, and kept them for some weeks while \nthe old man was recovering. One of his com- \nrades, talking of women, began chaffing Ros- \nt6v, saying that he was more wily than any of \nthem and that it would not be a bad thing if \nhe introduced to them the pretty Polish girl he \nhad saved. Rost6v took the joke as an insult, \n\n\n\nBOOK FIVE \n\n\n\n223 \n\n\n\nflared up, and said such unpleasant things to \nthe officer that it was all Denfsov could do to \nprevent aduel.Whentheofficerhad goneaway, \nDenfsov, who did not himself know what Ros- \nt6v's relations with the Polish girl might be, be- \ngan to upbraid him for his quickness of tem- \nper, and Rostov replied: \n\n"Say what you like. . . . She is like a sister to \nme, and I can't tell you how it offended me \n. . . because . . . well, for that reason. . . ." \n\nDenisov patted him on the shoulder and be- \ngan rapidly pacing the room without looking \nat Rostov, as was his way at moments of deep \nfeeling. \n\n"Ah, what a mad bweed you Wostovs are!" \nhe muttered, and Rost6v noticed tears in his \neyes. \n\nCHAPTER XVI \n\nIN APRIL the troops were enlivened by news \nof the Emperor's arrival, but Rost6v had no \nchance of being present at the review he held \nat Bartenstein, as the Pavlograds were at the \noutposts far beyond that place. \n\nThey were bivouacking. Denisov and Ros- \nt6v were living in an earth hut, dug out for \nthem by the soldiers and roofed with branches \nand turf. The hut was made in the following \nmanner, which had then come into vogue. A \ntrench was dug three and a half feet wide, four \nfeet eight inches deep, and eight feet long. At \none end of the trench, steps were cut out and \nthese formed the entrance and vestibule. The \ntrench itself was the room, in which the lucky \nones, such as the squadron commander, had a \nboard, lying on piles at the end opposite the \nentrance, to serve as a table. On each side of \nthe trench, the earth was cut out to a breadth \nof about two and a half feet, and this did duty \nfor bedsteads and couches. The roof was so \nconstructed that one could stand up in the mid- \ndle of the trench and could even sit up on the \nbeds if one drew close to the table. Denfsov, \nwho was living luxuriously because the sol- \ndiers of his squadron liked him, had also a \nboard in the roof at the farther end, with a \npiece of (broken but mended) glass in it for a \nwindow. When it was very cold, embers from \nthe soldiers' campfire were placed on a bent \nsheet of iron on the steps in the "reception \nroom" as Denfsov called that part of the hut \nand it was then so warm that the officers, of \nwhom there were always some with Denfsov \nand Rost6v, sat in their shirt sleeves. \n\nIn April, Rost6v was on orderly duty. One \nmorning, between seven and eight, returning \n\n\n\nafter a sleepless night, he sent for embers, \nchanged his rain-soaked underclothes, said his \nprayers, drank tea, got warm, then tidied up \nthe things on the table and in his own corner, \nand, his face glowing from exposure to the \nwind and with nothing on but his shirt, lay \ndown on his back, putting his arms under his \nhead. He was pleasantly considering the prob- \nability of being promoted in a few days for his \nlast reconnoitering expedition, and was await- \ning Denisov, who had gone out somewhere and \nwith whom he wanted a talk. \n\nSuddenly he heard Denisov shouting in a vi- \nbrating voice behind the hut, evidently much \nexcited. Rost6v moved to the window to see \nwhom he was speaking to, and saw the quarter- \nmaster, Topche'enko. \n\n"I ordered you not to let them eat that Mash- \nka woot stuff!" Denisov was shouting. "And I \nsaw with my own eyes how Lazarchuk bwought \nsome fwom the fields." \n\n"I have given the order again and again, \nyour honor, but they don't obey, "answered the \nquartermaster. \n\nRost6v lay down again on his bed and \nthought complacently: "Let him fuss and bus- \ntle now, my job's done and I'm lying down- \ncapitally!" He could hear that Lavrushka \nthat sly, bold orderly of Denisov's was talking, \nas well as the quartermaster. Lavrushka was \nsaying something about loaded wagons, bis- \ncuits, and oxen he had seen when he had gone \nout for provisions. \n\nThen Denisov's voice was heard shouting \nfarther and farther away. "Saddle! Second pla- \ntoon!" \n\n"Where are they off to now?" thought Ros- \nt6v. \n\nFive minutes later, Denfsov came into the \nhut, climbed with muddy boots on the bed, \nlit his pipe, furiously scattered his things \nabout, took his leaded whip, buckled on his \nsaber, and went out again. In answer to Ros- \nt6v's inquiry where he was going, he answered \nvaguely and crossly that he had some business. \n\n"Let God and our gweat monarch judge me \nafterwards!" said Denfsov going out, and Ros- \nt6v heard the hoofs of several horses splashing \nthrough the mud. He did not % even trouble to \nfind out where Denfsov had gone. Having got \nwarm in his corner, he fell asleep and did not \nleave the hut till toward evening. Denfsov had \nnot yet returned. The weather had cleared up, \nand near the next hut two officers and a cadet \nwere playing svdyka, laughing as they threw \ntheir missiles which buried themselves in the \n\n\n\n224 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nsoft mud. Rostdv joined them. In the middle \nof the game, the officers saw some wagons ap- \nproaching with fifteen hussars on their skinny \nhorses behind them. The wagons escorted by \nthe hussars drew up to the picket ropes and a \ncrowd of hussars surrounded them. \n\n"There now, Denfsov has been worrying," \nsaid Rost6v, "and here are the provisions." \n\n"So they are!" said the officers. "Won't the \nsoldiers be glad!" \n\nA little behind the hussars came Denfsov, \naccompanied by two infantry officers with \nwhom he was talking. \n\nRost6v went to meet them. \n\n"I warn you, Captain," one of the officers, a \nshort thin man, evidently very angry, was say- \ning. \n\n"Haven't I told you I won't give them up?" \nreplied Denfsov. \n\n"You will answer for it, Captain. It is mu- \ntinyseizing the transport of one's own army. \nOur men have had nothing to eat for two days." \n\n"And mine have had nothing for two weeks," \nsaid Denfsov. \n\n"It is robbery! You'll answer for it, sir!" said \nthe infantry officer, raising his voice. \n\n"Now, what are you pestewing me for?" \ncried Denfsov, suddenly losing his temper. "I \nshall answer for it and not you, and you'd bet- \nter not buzz about here till you get hurt. Be off I \nGo!" he shouted at the officers. \n\n"Very well, then!" shouted the little officer, \nundaunted and not riding away. "If you are \ndetermined to rob, I'll . . ." \n\n"Go to the devil! quick ma'ch, while you're \nsafe and sound!" and Denfsov turned his horse \non the officer. \n\n"Very well, very well!" muttered the officer, \nthreateningly, and turning his horse he trotted \naway, jolting in his saddle. \n\n"A dog astwide a fence! A weal dog astwide \na fence!" shouted Denfsov after him (the most \ninsulting expression a cavalryman can address \nto a mounted infantryman) and riding up to \nRost6v, he burst out laughing. \n\n"I've taken twansports from the infantwy by \nforce!" he said. "After all, can't let our men \nstarve." \n\nThe wagons that had reached the hussars \nhad been consigned to an infantry regiment, \nbut learning from La vnishka that the transport \nwas unescorted, Denfsov with his hussars had \nseized it by force. The soldiers had biscuits \ndealt out to them freely, and they even shared \nthem with the other squadrons. \n\nThe next day the regimental commander \n\n\n\nsent for Denfsov, and holding his fingers spread \nout before his eyes said: \n\n"This is howl look at thisaffair: I know noth- \ning about it and won't begin proceedings, but \nI advise you to ride over to the staff and settle \nthe business there in the commissariat depart- \nment and if possible sign a receipt forsuch and \nsuch stores received. If not, as the demand was \nbooked against an infantry regiment, there will \nbe a row and the affair may end badly." \n\nFrom the regimental commander's, Denfsov \nrode straight to the staff with a sincere desire \nto act on this advice. In the evening he came \nback to his dugout in a state such as Rostov \nhad never yet seen him in. Denfsov could not \nspeak and gasped for breath. When Rostov \nasked what was the matter, he only uttered \nsome incoherent oaths and threats in a hoarse, \nfeeble voice. \n\nAlarmed at Denfsov's condition, Rost6v sug- \ngested that he should undress, drink some wa- \nter, and send for the doctor. \n\n"Twy me for wobbewy ... oh! Some more \nwater . . . Let them twy me, but I'll always \nthwash scoundwels . . . and I'll tell the Empe- \nwo' . . . Ice . . ." he muttered. \n\nThe regimental doctor, when he came, said \nit was absolutely necessary to bleed Denfsov. A \ndeep saucer of black blood was taken from his \nhairy arm and only then was he able to relate \nwhat had happened to him. \n\n"I get there," began Denfsov. " 'Now then, \nwhere's your chief's quarters?' They were point- \ned out. 'Please to wait.' 'I've widden twenty \nmiles and have duties to attend to and no \ntime to wait. Announce me/ Vewy well, so \nout comes their head chief also took it into his \nhead to lecture me: 'It's wobbewy!' 'Wobbe- \nwy,' I say, 'is not done by a man who seizes pwo- \nvisions to feed his soldiers, but by him who \ntakes them to fill his own pockets!' 'Will you \nplease be silent?' 'Vewy good!' Then he says: \n'Go and give a weceipt to the commissioner, \nbut your affair will be passed on to headquar- \nters.' I go to the commissioner. I enter, and at \nthe table . . . who do you think? No, but wait a \nbit! . . . Who is it that's starving us?" shouted \nDenfsov, hitting the table with the fist of his \nnewly bled arm so violently that the table near- \nly broke down and the tumblers on it jumped \nabout. "Telydnin! 'What? So it's you who's \nstarving us to death! Is it? Take this and this!' \nand I hit him so pat, stwaight on his snout . . . \n'Ah, what a . . .what . . . 1'and I sta'ted f washing \nhim . . .Well, I've had a bit of fun I can tell you!" \ncried Denfsov, gleeful and yet angry, his white \n\n\n\nBOOK FIVE \n\n\n\n225 \n\n\n\nteeth showing under his black mustache. \n"I'd have killed him if they hadn't taken him \nawayl" \n\n"But what are you shouting for? Calm your- \nself," said Rost6v. "You've set your arm bleed- \ning afresh. Wait, we must tie it up again." \n\nDenisov was bandaged up again and put to \nbed. Next day he woke calm and cheerful. \n\nBut at noon the adjutant of the regiment \ncame into Rost6v's and Denfsov's dugout with \na grave and serious face and regretfully showed \nthem a paper addressed to Major Denfsov from \nthe regimental commander in which inquiries \nwere made about yesterday's occurrence. The \nadjutant told them that the affair was likely \nto take a very bad turn: that a court-martial \nhad been appointed, and that in view of the \nseverity with which marauding and insubordi- \nnation were now regarded, degradation to the \nranks would be the best that could be hoped \nfor. \n\nThe case, as represented by the offended par- \nties, was that, after seizing the transports, Ma- \njor Denisov, being drunk, went to the chief \nquartermaster and without any provocation \ncalled him a thief, threatened to strike him, \nand on being led out had rushed into the office \nand given two officials a thrashing, and dislo- \ncated the arm of one of them. \n\nIn answer to Rost6v's renewed questions, \nDenfsov said, laughing, that he thought he re- \nmembered that some other fellow had got \nmixed up in it, but that it was all nonsense and \nrubbish, and he did not in the least fear any \nkind of trial, and that if those scoundrels dared \nattack him he would give them an answer that \nthey would not easily forget. \n\nDenfsov spoke contemptuously of the whole \nmatter, but Rost6v knew him too well not to \ndetect that (while hiding it from others) at \nheart he feared a court-martial and was wor- \nried over the affair, which was evidently tak- \ning a bad turn. Every day, letters of inquiry \nand notices from the court arrived, and on the \nfirst of May, Denfsov was ordered to hand the \nsquadron over to the next in seniority and ap- \npear before the staff of his division to explain \nhis violence at the commissariat office. On the \nprevious day Pldtov reconnoitered with two \nCossack regiments and two squadrons of hus- \nsars. Denisov, as was his wont, rode out in front \nof the outposts, parading his courage. A bullet \nfired by a French sharpshooter hit him in the \nfleshy part of his leg. Perhaps at another time \nDenfsov would not have left the regiment for \nso slight a wound, but now he took advantage \n\n\n\nof it to excuse himself from appearing at the \nstaff and went into hospital. \n\nCHAPTER XVII \n\nIN JUNE the battle of Friedland was fought, in \nwhich the Pavlograds did not take part, and \nafter that an armistice was proclaimed. Rost6v, \nwho felt his friend's absence very much, having \nno news of him since he left and feeling very \nanxious about his wound and the progress of \nhis affairs, took advantage of the armistice to \nget leave to visit Denfsov in hospital. \n\nThe hospital was in a small Prussian town \nthat had been twice devastated by Russian and \nFrench troops. Because it was summer, when it \nis so beautiful out in the fields, the little town \npresented a particularly dismal appearance \nwith its broken roofs and fences, its foul streets, \ntattered inhabitants, and the sick and drunken \nsoldiers wandering about. \n\nThe hospital was in a brick building with \nsome of the window frames and panes broken \nand a courtyard surrounded by the remains of \na wooden fence that had been pulled to pieces. \nSeveral bandaged soldiers, with pale swollen \nfaces, were sitting or walking about in the sun- \nshine in the yard. \n\nDirectly Rost6v entered the door he was en- \nveloped by a smell of putrefaction and hospital \nair. On the stairs he met a Russian army doc- \ntor smoking a cigar. The doctor was followed \nby a Russian assistant. \n\n"I can't tear myself to pieces," the doctor was \nsaying. "Come to Makar Alexe*evich in the eve- \nning. I shall be there." \n\nThe assistant asked some further questions. \n\n"Oh, do the best you can! Isn't it all the \nsame?" The doctor noticed Rost6v coming up- \nstairs. \n\n"What do you want, sir?" said the doctor. \n"What do you want? The bullets having spared \nyou, do you want to try typhus? This is a pest- \nhouse, sir." \n\n"How so?" asked Rost6v. \n\n"Typhus, sir. It's death to go in. Only we \ntwo, Mak^ev and I" (he pointed to the assist- \nant), "keep on here. Some five of us doctors \nhave died in this place. . . . When a new one \ncomes he is done for in a week," said the doc- \ntor with evident satisfaction. "Prussian doctors \nhave been invited here, but our allies don't \nlike it at all." \n\nRost6v explained that he wanted to see Ma- \njor Denfsov of the hussars, who was wounded. \n\n"I don't know. I can't tell you, sir. Only \nthink] I am alone in charge of three hospitals \n\n\n\n226 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nwith more than four hundred patients! It's \nwell that the charitable Prussian ladies send us \ntwo pounds of coffee and some lint each month \nor we should be lost!" he laughed. "Four hun- \ndred, sir, and they're always sending me fresh \nones. There are four hundred? Eh?" he asked, \nturning to the assistant. \n\nThe assistant looked fagged out. He was evi- \ndently vexed and impatient for the talkative \ndoctor to go. \n\n"Major Denisov," Rost6v said again. "He \nwas wounded at Molliten." \n\n"Dead, I fancy. Eh, Mak^ev?" queried the \ndoctor, in a tone of indifference. \n\nThe assistant, however, did not confirm the \ndoctor's words. \n\n"Is he tall and with reddish hair?" asked the \ndoctor. \n\nRost6v described Denisov's appearance. \n\n"There was one like that," said the doctor, \nas if pleased. "That one is dead, I fancy. How- \never, I'll look up our list. We had a list. Have \nyou got it, Makev?" \n\n"Makir Alextfevich has the list," answered \nthe assistant. "But if you'll step into the officers' \nwards you'll see for yourself," he added, turn- \ning to Rostov. \n\n"Ah, you'd better not go, sir," said the doc- \ntor, "or you may have to stay here yourself." \n\nBut Rost6v bowed himself away from the \ndoctor and asked the assistant to show him the \nway. \n\n"Only don't blame me!" the doctor shouted \nup after him. \n\nRost6v and the assistant went into the dark \ncorridor. The smell was so strong there that \nRost6v held his nose and had to pause and \ncollect his strength before he could go on. A \ndoor opened to the right, and an emaciated \nsallow man on crutches, barefoot and in un- \nderclothing, limped out and, leaning against \nthe doorpost, looked with glittering envious \neyes at those who were passing. Glancing in at \nthe door,Rost6v saw that the sick and wounded \nwere lying on the floor on straw and overcoats. \n\n"May I go in and look?" \n\n"What is there to see?" said the assistant. \n\nBut, just because the assistant evidently did \nnot want him to go in, Rost6v entered the sol- \ndiers' ward. The foul air, to which he had al- \nready begun to get used in the corridor, was \nstill stronger here. It was a little different, \nmore pungent, and one felt that this was where \nit originated. \n\nIn the long room, brightly lit up by the sun \nthrough the large windows, the sick and wound- \n\n\n\ned lay in two rows with their heads to the walls, \nand leaving a passage in the middle. Most of \nthem were unconscious and paid no attention \nto the newcomers. Those who were conscious \nraised themselves or lifted their thin yellow \nfaces, and all looked intently at Rost6v with \nthe same expression of hope, of relief, re- \nproach, and envy of another's health. Rost6v \nwent to the middle of the room and looking \nthrough the open doors into the two adjoining \nrooms saw the same thing there. He stood still, \nlooking silently around. He had not at all ex- \npected such a sight. Just before him, almost \nacross the middle of the passage on the bare \nfloor, lay a sick man, probably a Cossack to \njudge by the cut of his hair. The man lay on \nhis back, his huge arms and legs outstretched. \nHis face was purple, his eyes were rolled back \nso that only the whites were seen, and on his \nbare legs and arms which were still red, the \nveins stood out like cords. He was knocking \nthe back of his head against the floor, hoarsely \nuttering some word which he kept repeating. \nRost6v listened and made out the word. It \nwas "drink, drink, a drinkl" Rost6v glanced \nround, looking for someone who would put \nthis man back in his place and bring him wa- \nter. \n\n"Who looks after the sick here?" he asked \nthe assistant. \n\nJust then a commissariat soldier, a hospital \norderly, came in from the next room, march- \ning stiffly, and drew up in front of Rost6v. \n\n"Good day, your honor!" he shouted, roll- \ning his eyes at Rostov and evidently mistaking \nhim for one of the hospital authorities. \n\n"Get him to his place and give him some \nwater," said Rost6v, pointing to the Cossack. \n\n"Yes, your honor," the soldier replied com- \nplacently, and rolling his eyes more than ever \nhe drew himself up still straighter, but did not \nmove. \n\n"No, it's impossible to do anything here," \nthought Rost6v, lowering his eyes, and he was \ngoing out, but became aware of an intense look \nfixed on him on his right, and he turned. Close \nto the corner, on an overcoat, sat an old, un- \nshaven, gray-bearded soldier as thin as a skele- \nton, with a stern sallow face and eyes intently \nfixed on Rost6v. The man's neighbor on one \nside whispered something to him, pointing at \nRost6v, who noticed that the old man wanted \nto speak to him. He drew nearer and saw that \nthe old man had only one leg bent under him, \nthe other had been amputated above the knee. \nHis neighbor on the other side, who lay mo- \n\n\n\nBOOK \n\ntionless some distance from him with his head \nthrown back, was a young soldier with a snub \nnose. His pale waxen face was still freckled \nand his eyes were rolled back. Rost6v looked \nat the young soldier and a cold chill ran down \nhis back. \n\n"Why, this one seems . . ." he began, turning \nto the assistant. \n\n"And how we've been begging, your honor," \nsaid the old soldier, his jaw quivering. "He's \nbeen dead since morning. After all we're men, \nnot dogs." \n\n"I'll send someone at once. He shall be tak- \nen away taken a way at once," said the assistant \nhurriedly. "Let us go, your honor." \n\n"Yes, yes, let us go," said Rost6v hastily, and \nlowering his eyes and shrinking, he tried to \npass unnoticed between the rows of reproach- \nful envious eyes that were fixed upon him, and \nwent out of the room. \n\nCHAPTER XVIII \n\nGOING ALONG the corridor, the assistant led \nRost6v to the officers' wards, consisting of three \nrooms, the doors of which stood open. There \nwere beds in these rooms and the sick and \nwounded officers were lying or sitting on them. \nSome were walking about the rooms in hospital \ndressing gowns. The first person Rostov met \nin the officers' ward was a thin little man with \none arm, who was walking about the first room \nin a nightcap and hospital dressing gown, with \na pipe between his teeth. Rost6v looked at him, \ntrying to remember where he had seen him be- \nfore. \n\n"See where we've met again I" said the little \nman. "Tushin, Tiishin, don't you remember, \nwho gave you a lift at Schon Grabern? And \nI've had a bit cut off, you see . . ." he went on \nwith a smile, pointing to the empty sleeve of \nhis dressing gown. "Looking for Vasili Dmft- \nrich Denfsov? My neighbor," he added, when \nhe heard who Rost6v wanted. "Here, here," \nand Tiishin led him into the next room, from \nwhence came sounds of several laughing voices. \n\n"How can they laugh, or even live at all \nhere?" thought Rost6v, still aware of that \nsmell of decomposing flesh that had been so \nstrong in the soldiers' ward, and still seeming \nto see fixed on him those envious looks which \nhad followed him out from both sides, and the \nface of that young soldier with eyes rolled \nback. \n\nDenfsov lay asleep on his bed with his head \nunder the blanket, though it was nearly noon. \n\n"Ah, Wost6v? How are you, how are you?" \n\n\n\nFIVE 227 \n\nhe called out, still in the same voice as in the \nregiment, but Rost6v noticed sadly that under \nthis habitual ease and animation some new, \nsinister, hidden feeling showed itself in the \nexpression of Denfsov's face and the intona- \ntions of his voice. \n\nHis wound, though a slight one, had not yet \nhealed even now, six weeks after he had been \nhit. His face had the same swollen pallor as the \nfaces of the other hospital patients, but it was \nnot this that struck Rostov. What struck him \nwas that Denfsov did not seem glad to see him, \nand smiled at him unnaturally. He did not \nask about the regiment, nor about the general \nstate of affairs, and when Rost6v spoke of these \nmatters did not listen. \n\nRostov even noticed that Denfsov did not \nlike to be reminded of the regiment, or in gen- \neral of that other free life which was going on \noutside the hospital. He seemed to try to for- \nget that old life and was only interested in the \naffair with the commissariat officers. On Ros- \nt6v's inquiry as to how the matter stood, he at \nonce produced from under his pillow a paper \nhe had received from the commission and the \nrough draft of his answer to it. He became ani- \nmated when he began reading his paper and \nspecially drew Rostov's attention to the sting- \ning rejoinders he made to his enemies. His \nhospital companions, who had gathered round \nRost6v a fresh arrival from the world outside \ngradually began to disperse as soon as Denf- \nsov began reading his answer. Rost6v noticed \nby their faces that all those gentlemen had al- \nready heard that story more than once and \nwere tired of it. Only the man who had the \nnext bed, a stout Uhlan, continued to sit on \nhis bed, gloomily frowning and smoking a \npipe, and little one-armed Tiishin still lis- \ntened, shaking his head disapprovingly. In the \nmiddle of the reading, the Uhlan interrupted \nDenisov. \n\n"But what I say is," he said, turning to Ros- \nt6v, "it would be best simply to petition the \nEmperor for pardon. They say great rewards \nwill now be distributed, and surely a pardon \nwould be granted. . . ." \n\n"Me petition the Einpcwo' 1 " exclaimed Denf- \nsov, in a voice to which he tried hard to give \nthe old energy and fire, but which sounded like \nan expression of irritable impotence. "What \nfor? If I were a wobber I would ask mercy, but \nI'm being court-martialed for bwinging wob- \nbers to book. Let them twy me, I'm not afwaid \nof anyone. I'veserved the Tsar and mycountwy \nhonowably and have not stolen! And am I to \n\n\n\n2*8 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nbe degwaded? , . . Listen, I'm w'iting to them \nstwaight. This is what I say: 'If I had wobbed \nthe Tweasuwy . . .' " \n\n"It's certainly well written," said Tiishin, \n"but that's not the point, Vasili Dmitrich," \nand he also turned to Rost6v. "One has to sub- \nmit, and Vasili Dmftrich doesn't want to. You \nknow the auditor told you it was a bad busi- \nness." \n\n"Well, let it be bad," said Denfsov. \n\n"The auditor wrote out a petition for you," \ncontinued Tiishin, "and you ought to sign it \nand ask this gentleman to take it. No doubt he" \n(indicating Rost6v) "has connections on the \nstaff. You won't find a better opportunity." \n\n"Haven't I said I'm not going to gwovel?" \nDenfsov interrupted him, and went on read- \ning his paper. \n\nRostov had not the courage to persuade \nDenisov, though he instinctively felt that the \nway advised by Tiishin and the other officers \nwas the safest, and though he would have been \nglad to be of service to Denisov. He knew his \nstubborn will and straightforward hasty tem- \n\nM*r. \n\n) When the reading of Denisov's virulent re- \n'ply, which took more than an hour, was over, \nRost6v said nothing, and he spent the rest of \nthe day in a most dejected state of mind amid \nDenisov's hospital comrades, who had gathered \nround him, telling them what he knew and lis- \ntening to their stories. Denisov was moodily \nsilent all the evening. \n\nLate in the evening, when Rost6v was about \nto leave, he asked Denisov whether he had no \ncommission for him. \n\n"Yes, wait a bit," said Denisov, glancing \nround at the officers, and taking his papers \nfrom under his pillow he went to the window, \nwhere he had an inkpot, and sat down to write. \n\n"It seems it's no use knocking one's head \nagainst a walll" he said, coming from the win- \ndow and giving Rost6v a large envelope. In it \nwas the petition to the Emperor drawn up by \nthe auditor, in which Denisov, without allud- \ning to the offenses of the commissariat officials, \nsimply asked for pardon. \n\n"Hand it in. It seems . . ." \n\nHe did not finish, but gave a painfully un- \nnatural smile. \n\nCHAPTER XIX \n\nHAVING RETURNED to the regiment and told \nthe commander the state of Denisov's affairs, \nRost6v rode to Tilsit with the letter to the \nEmperor. \n\n\n\nOn the thirteenth of June the French and \nRussian Emperors arrived in Tilsit. Boris Dru- \nbetsk6y had asked the important personage on \nwhom he was in attendance, to include him in \nthe suite appointed for the stay at Tilsit. \n\n"I should like to see the great man," he said, \nalluding to Napoleon, whom hitherto he, like \neveryone else, had always called Buonaparte. \n\n"You are speaking of Buonaparte?" asked \nthe general, smiling. \n\nBoris looked at his general inquiringly and \nimmediately saw that he was being tested. \n\n"I am speaking, Prince, of the Emperor Na- \npoleon," he replied. The general patted him \non the shoulder, with a smile. \n\n"You will go far," he said, and took him to \nTilsit with him. \n\nBoris was among the few present at the Nie- \nmen on the day the two Emperors met. He saw \nthe raft, decorated with monograms, saw Napo- \nleon pass before the French Guards on the \nfarther bank of the river, saw the pensive face \nof the Emperor Alexander as he sat in silence \nin a tavern on the bank of the Niemen await- \ning Napoleon's arrival, saw both Emperors get \ninto boats, and saw how Napoleon reaching \nthe raft first stepped quickly forward to meet \nAlexander and held out his hand to him, arid \nhow they both retired into the pavilion. Since \nhe had begun to move in the highest circles \nBoris had made it his habit to watch attentive- \nly all that went on around him and to note it \ndown. At the time of the meeting at Tilsit he \nasked the names of those who had come with \nNapoleon and about the uniforms they wore, \nand listened attentively to words spoken by im- \nportant personages. At the moment the Em- \nperors went into the pavilion he looked at his \nwatch, and did not forget to look at it again \nwhen Alexander came out. The interview had \nlasted an hour and fifty-three minutes. He \nnoted this down that same evening, among oth- \ner facts he felt to be of historic importance. As \nthe Emperor's suite was a very small one, it was \na matter of great importance, for a man who \nvalued his success in the service, to be at Tilsit \non the occasion of this interview between the \ntwo Emperors, and having succeeded in this, \nBoris felt that henceforth his position was ful- \nly assured. He had not only become known, \nbut people had grown accustomed to him and \naccepted him. Twice he had executed commis- \nsions to the Emperor himself, so that the latter \nknew his face, and all those at court, far from \ncold-shouldering him as at first when they con- \nsidered him a newcomer, would now have been \n\n\n\nBOOK FIVE \n\n\n\n229 \n\n\n\nsurprised had he been absent. \n\nBorfs lodged with another adjutant, the Pol- \nish Count Zhilinski. Zhilinski, a Pole brought \nup in Paris, was rich, and passionately fond of \nthe French, and almost every day of the stay at \nTilsit, French officers of the Guard and from \nFrench headquarters were dining and lunch- \ning with him and Boris. \n\nOn the evening of the twenty-fourth of June, \nCount Zhilfnski arranged a supper for his \nFrench friends. The guest of honor was an aide- \nde-camp of Napoleon's, there were also several \nFrench officers of the Guard, and a page of Na- \npoleon's, a young lad of an old aristocratic \nFrench family. That same day, Rost6v, profit- \ning by the darkness to avoid being recognized \nin civilian dress, came to Tilsit and went to the \nlodging occupied by Borfs and Zhilinski. \n\nRostov, in common with the whole army \nfrom which he came, was far from having ex- \nperienced the change of feeling toward Napo- \nleon and the French who from being foes had \nsuddenly become friends that had taken place \nat headquarters and in Boris. In the army, Bon- \naparte and the French were still regarded with \nmingled feelings of anger, contempt, and fear. \nOnly recently, talkingwith one of PLltov's Cos- \nsack officers, Rost6v had argued that if Napole- \non were taken prisoner he would be treated not \nas a sovereign, but as a criminal. Quite lately, \nhappening to meet a wounded French colonel \non the road, Rost6v had maintained with heat \nthat peace was impossible between a legitimate \nsovereign and the criminal Bonaparte. Rost6v \nwas therefore unpleasantly struck by the pres- \nence of French officers in Boris' lodging, dressed \nin uniforms he had been accustomed to see \nfrom quite a different point of view from the \noutposts of the flank. As soon as he noticed a \nFrench officer, who thrust his head out of the \ndoor, that warlike feeling of hostility which he \nalways experienced at the sight of the enemy \nsuddenly seized him. He stopped at the thresh- \nold and asked in Russian whether Drubetsk6y \nlived there. Boris, hearing a strange voice in \nthe anteroom, came out to meet him. An ex- \npression of annoyance showed itself for a mo- \nment on his face on first recognizing Rost6v. \n\n"Ah, it's you? Very glad, very glad to see you," \nhe said, however, coming toward him with a \nsmile. But Rost6v had noticed his first impulse. \n\n"I've come at a bad time I think. I should \nnot have come, but I have business," he said \ncoldly. \n\n"No, I only wonder how you managed to get \naway from your regiment. Dans un moment jc \n\n\n\nsuis &amp; vous," l he said, answering someone who \ncalled him. \n\n"I see I'm intruding," Rost6v repeated. \n\nThe look of annoyance had already disap- \npeared from Borfs' face: having evidently re- \nflected and decided how to act, he very quiet- \nly took both Rost6v's hands and led him into \nthe next room. His eyes, looking serenely and \nsteadily at Rost6v, seemed to be veiled by some- \nthing, as if screened by blue spectacles of con- \nventionality. So it seemed to Rost6v. \n\n"Oh, come now! As if you could come at a \nwrong time!" said Boris, and he led him into \nthe room where the supper table was laid and \nintroduced him to his guests, explaining that \nhe was not a civilian, but an hussar officer, and \nan old friend of his. \n\n"Count Zhilinski le Comic N. N. le Capi- \ntaine S. S.," said he, naming his guests. Rost6v \nlooked frowningly at the Frenchmen, bowed \nreluctantly, and remained silent. \n\nZhilinski evidently did not receive this new \nRussian person very willingly into his circle \nand did not speak to Rost6v. Boris did not ap- \npear to notice the constraint the newcomer \nproduced and, with the same pleasant compo- \nsure and the same veiled look in his eyes with \nwhich he had met Rost6v, tried to enliven the \nconversation. One of the Frenchmen, with the \npoliteness characteristic of his countrymen, ad- \ndressed the obstinately taciturn Rost6v, say- \ning that the latter had probably come to Tilsit \nto see the Emperor. \n\n"No, 1 came on business," replied Rostov, \nbriefly. \n\nRostov had been out of humor from the mo- \nment he noticed the look of dissatisfaction on \nBoris' face, and as always happens to those in \na bad humor, it seemed to him that everyone \nregarded him with aversion and that he was in \neverybody's way. He really was in their way, \nfor he alone took no part in the conversation \nwhich again became general. The looks the \nvisitors cast on him seemed to say: "And what \nis he sitting here for?" He rose and went up to \nBorfs. \n\n"Anyhow, I'm in your way," he said in a low \ntone. "Corrie and talk over my business and I'll \ngo away." \n\n"Oh, no, not at all," said Borfs. "But if you \nare tired, come and lie down in my room and \nhave a rest." \n\n"Yes, really . . ." \n\nThey went into the little room where Boris \nslept. Rost6v, without sitting down, began at \n\n1 "In a minute I shall be at your disposal." \n\n\n\n230 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nonce, irritably (as if Boris were to blame in \nsome way) telling him about Denisov's affair, \nasking him whether, through his general, he \ncould and would intercede with the Emperor \non Denisov's behalf and get Denisov's petition \nhanded in. When he and Boris were alone, Ros- \nt6v felt for the first time that he could not look \nBoris in the face without a sense of awkward- \nness. Boris, with one leg crossed over the other \nand stroking his left hand with the slender fin- \ngers of his right, listened to Rost6v as a general \nlistens to the report of a subordinate, now look- \ning aside and now gazing straight into Rost6v's \neyes with the same veiled look. Each time this \nhappened Rost6v felt uncomfortable and cast \ndown his eyes. \n\n"I have heard of such cases and know that \nHis Majesty is very severe in such affairs. I \nthink it would be best not to bring it before the \nEmperor, but to apply to the commander of \nthe corps. . . . But in general, I think . . ." \n\n"So you don't want to do anything? Well \nthen, say so!" Rostov almost shouted, not look- \ning Boris in the face. \n\nBoris smiled. \n\n"On the contrary, I will do what I can. Only \nI thought . . ." \n\nAt that moment Zhilfnski's voice was heard \ncalling Boris. \n\n"Well then, go, go, go . . ." said Rost6v, and \nrefusing supper and remaining alone in the \nlittle room, he walked up and down for a long \ntime, hearing the lighthearted French conver- \nsation from the next room. \n\nCHAPTER XX \n\nROSTOV HAD COME toTilsiton the day least suit- \nable for a petition on Denisov's behalf. He \ncould not himself go to the general in attend- \nance as he was in mufti and had come to Tilsit \nwithout permission to do so, and Boris, even \nhad he wished to, could not have done so on \nthe following day. On that day, June 27, the \npreliminaries of peace were signed. The Em- \nperors exchanged decorations: Alexander re- \nceived the Cross of the Legion of Honor and \nNapoleon the Order of St. Andrew of the First \nDegree, and a dinner had been arranged for \nthe evening, given by a battalion of the French \nGuards to the Preobrazhdnsk battalion. The \nEmperors were to be present at that banquet. \n\nRost6v felt so ill at ease and uncomfortable \nwith Boris that, when the latter looked in after \nsupper, he pretended to be asleep, and early \nnext morning went away, avoiding Boris. In his \ncivilian clothes and a round hat, he wandered \n\n\n\nabout the town, staring at the French and \ntheir uniforms and at the streets and houses \nwhere the Russian and French Emperors were \nstaying. In a square he saw tables being set up \nand preparations made for the dinner; he saw \nthe Russian and French colors draped from side \nto side of the streets, with hugh monograms \nA and AT. In the windows of the houses also \nflags and bunting were displayed. \n\n"Boris doesn't want to help me and I don't \nwant to ask him. That's settled," thought Nich- \nolas. "All is over between us, but I won't leave \nhere without having done all I can for Denisov \nand certainly not without getting his letter to \nthe Emperor. The Emperor! . . . He is here!" \nthought Rost6v, who had unconsciously re- \nturned to the house where Alexander lodged. \n\nSaddled horses were standing before the \nhouse and the suite were assembling, evidently \npreparing for the Emperor to come out. \n\n"I may see him at any moment," thought Ros- \nt6v. "If only I were to hand the letter direct to \nhim and tell him all ... could they really ar- \nrest me for my civilian clothes? Surely not! He \nwould understand on whose side justice lies. \nHe understands everything, knows everything. \nWho can be more just, more magnanimous \nthan he? And even if they did arrest me for be- \ning here, what would it matter?" thought he, \nlooking at an officer who was entering the \nhouse the Emperor occupied. "After all, peo- \nple do go in. ... It's all nonsense! I'll go in \nand hand the letter to the Emperor myself, so \nmuch the worse for Drubetsk6y who drives me \nto it!" And suddenly with a determination he \nhimself did not expect, Rost6v felt for the let- \nter in his pocket and went straight to the house. \n\n"No, I won't miss my opportunity now, as I \ndid after Austerlitz," he thought, expecting ev- \nery moment to meet the monarch, and con- \nscious of the blood that rushed to his heart at \nthe thought. "I will fall at his feet and beseech \nhim. He will lift me up, will listen, and will \neven thank me. 'I am happy when I can do \ngood, but to remedy injustice is the greatest \nhappiness,' " Rost6v fancied the sovereign \nsaying. And passing people who looked after \nhim with curiosity, he entered the porch of \nthe Emperor's house. \n\nA broad staircase led straight up from the \nentry, and to the right he saw a closed door. \nBelow, under the staircase, was a door leading \nto the lower floor. \n\n"Whom do you want?" someone inquired. \n\n"To hand in a letter, a petition, to His Maj- \nesty/' said Nicholas, with a tremor in his voice. \n\n\n\nBOOK FIVE \n\n\n\n231 \n\n\n\n"A petition? This way, to the officer on duty" \n(he was shown the door leading downstairs), \n"only it won't be accepted." \n\nOn hearing this indifferent voice, Rost6v \ngrew frightened at what he was doing; the \nthought of meeting the Emperor at any mo- \nment was so fascinating and consequently so \nalarming that he was ready to run away, but \nthe official who had questioned him opened the \ndoor, and Rost6v entered. \n\nA short stout man of about thirty, in white \nbreeches and high boots and a batiste shirt that \nhe had evidently only just put on, was standing \nin that room, and his valet was buttoning on to \nthe back of his breeches a new pair of hand- \nsome silk-embroidered braces that, for some \nreason, attracted Rostov's attention. This man \nwas speaking to someone in the ad join ing room. \n\n"A good figure and in her first bloom," he \nwas saying, but on seeing Rost6v, he stopped \nshort and frowned. \n\n"What is it? A petition?" \n\n"What is it?" asked the person in the other \nroom. \n\n"Another petitioner," answered the man \nwith the braces. \n\n"Tell him to come later. He'll be coming out \ndirectly, we must go." \n\n"Later . . . later! Tomorrow. It's too late " \n\nRostov turned and was about to go, but the \nman in the braces stopped him. \n\n"Whom have you come from? Who are you?" \n\n"I come from Major Denisov," answered \nRost6v. \n\n"Are you an officer?" \n\n"Lieutenant Count Rostov." \n\n"What audacity! Hand it in through your \ncommander. And go along with you . . . go," \nand he continued to put on the uniform the \nvalet handed him. \n\nRost6v went back into the hall and noticed \nthat in the porch there were many officers and \ngenerals in full parade uniform, whom he had \nto pass. \n\nCursing his temerity, his heart sinking at the \nthought of finding himself at any moment face \nto face with the Emperor and being put to shame \nand arrested in his presence, fully alive now to \nthe impropriety of his conduct and repenting \nof it, Rost6v, with downcast eyes, was making \nhis way out of the house through the brilliant \nsuite when a familiar voice called him and a \nhand detained him. \n\n"What are you doing here, sir, in civilian \ndress?" asked a deep voice. \n\nIt was a cavalry general who had obtained \n\n\n\nthe Emperor's special favor during this cam- \npaign, and who had formerly commanded the \ndivision in which Rost6v was serving. \n\nRost6v, in dismay, began justifying himself, \nbut seeing the kindly, jocular face of the gener- \nal, he took him aside and in an excited voice \ntold him the whole affair, asking him to inter- \ncede for Denfsov, whom the general knew. Hav- \ning heard Rost6v to the end, the general shook \nhis head gravely. \n\n"I'm sorry, sorry for that fine fellow. Give \nme the letter." \n\nHardly had Rost6v handed him the letter \nand finished explaining Denfsov's case, when \nhasty steps and the jingling of spurs were heard \non thestairs,and thegeneral, leaving him, went \nto the porch. The gentlemen of the Emperor's \nsuite ran down the stairs and went to their \nhorses. Hayne, the same groom who had been \nat Austerlitz, led up the Emperor's horse, and \nthe faint creak of a footstep Rost6v knew at \nonce was heard on the stairs. Forgetting the \ndanger of being recognized, Rostov went close \nto the porch, together with some inquisitive \ncivilians, and again, after two years, saw those \nfeatures he adored: that same face and same \nlook and step, and the same union of majesty \nand mildness. . . . And the feeling of enthusi- \nasm and love for his sovereign rose again in \nRostov's soul in all its old force. In the uniform \nof the Preobrazh^nsk regiment white chamois- \nleather breeches and high boots and wearing \na star Rost6v did not know (it was that of the \nLegion d'honneur), the monarch came out in- \nto the porch, putting on his gloves and carry- \ning his hat under his arm. He stopped and \nlooked about him, brightening everything \naround by his glance. He spoke a few words to \nsome of the generals, and, recognizing the for- \nmer commander of Rost6v's division, smiled \nand beckoned to him. \n\nAll the suite drew back and Rostov saw the \ngeneral talking for some time to the Emperor. \n\nThe Emperor said a few words to him and \ntook a step toward his horse. Again the crowd \nof members of the suite and street gazers \n(amongwhomwas Rost6v) moved nearer to the \nEmperor. Stopping beside his horse, with his \nhand on the saddle, the Emperor turned to the \ncavalry general and said in a loud voice, evi- \ndently wishing to be heard by all: \n\n"I cannot do it, General. I cannot, because \nthe law is stronger than I," and he raised his \nfoot to the stirrup. \n\nThegeneral bowed his head respectfully, and \nthe monarch mounted and rodedown thestreet \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nat a gallop. Beside himself with enthusiasm, \nRost6v ran after him with the crowd. \n\nCHAPTER XXI \n\nTHE EMPEROR rode to the square where, facing \none another, a battalion of the Preobrazhnsk \nregiment stood on the right and a battalion of \nthe French Guards in their bearskin caps on \nthe left. \n\nAs the Tsar rode up to one flank of the bat- \ntalions, which presented arms, another group \nof horsemen galloped up to the opposite flank, \nand at the head of them Rostov recognized Na- \npoleon. It could be no one else. He came at a \ngallop, wearing a small hat, a blue uniform \nopen over a white vest, and the St. Andrew rib- \nbon over his shoulder. He was riding a very \nfine thoroughbred gray Arab horsewith a crim- \nson gold-embroidered saddlecloth. On ap- \nproaching Alexander he raised his hat, and as \nhe did so, Rost6v, with his cavalryman's eye, \ncould not help noticing that Napoleon did not \nsit well or firmly in the saddle. The battalions \nshouted "Hurrah!" and "Vive I'Empereur!" \nNapoleon said something to Alexander, and \nboth Emperors dismounted and took each oth- \ner's hands. Napoleon's face wore an unpleas- \nant and artificial smile. Alexander was saying \nsomething affable to him. \n\nIn spite of the trampling of the French gen- \ndarmes' horses, which were pushing back the \ncrowd, Rost6vkept his eyes on every movement \nof Alexander and Bonaparte. It struck him as \na surprise that Alexander treated Bonaparte as \nan equal and that the latter was quite at ease \nwith the Tsar, as if such relations with an Em- \nperor were an everyday matter to him. \n\nAlexander and Napoleon, with the long train \nof their suites, approached the right flank of \nthe Preobrazh^nsk battalion and came straight \nup to the crowd standing there. The crowd un- \nexpectedly found itself so close to the Emper- \nors that Rostov, standing in the front row, was \nafraid he might be recognized. \n\n"Sire, I ask your permission to present the \nLegion of Honor to the bra vest of your soldiers," \nsaid a sharp, precise voice, articulating every \nletter. \n\nThis was said by the undersized Napoleon, \nlooking up straight into Alexander's eyes. \nAlexander listened attentively to what was \nsaid to him and, bending his head, smiled \npleasantly. \n\n"To him who has borne himself most brave- \nly in this last war," added Napoleon, accentuat- \ning each syllable, as with a composure and as- \n\n\n\nsurance exasperating to Rost6v, he ran his eyes \nover the Russian ranks drawn up before him, \nwho all presented arms with their eyes fixed on \ntheir Emperor. \n\n"Will Your Majesty allow me to consult the \ncolonel?" said Alexander and took a few hasty \nsteps toward Prince Kozldvski, the commander \nof the battalion. \n\nBonaparte meanwhile began taking the glove \noff his small white hand, tore it in doing so, \nand threw it away. An aide-de-camp behind \nhim rushed forward and picked it up. \n\n"To whom shall it be given?" the Emperor \nAlexander asked Kosl6vski, in Russian in a \nlow voice. \n\n"To whomever Your Majesty commands." \n\nThe Emperor knit his brows with dissatisfac- \ntion and, glancing back, remarked: \n\n"But we must give him an answer." \n\nKozl6vski scanned the ranks resolutely and \nincluded Rostov in his scrutiny. \n\n"Can it be me?" thought Rost6v. \n\n"Ldzarevl" the colonel called, with a frown, \nand Ldzarev, the first soldier in the rank, \nstepped briskly forward. \n\n"Where are you off to? Stop here!" voices \nwhispered to Ldzarev who did not know where \nto go. Ldzarev stopped, casting a sidelong look \nat his colonel in alarm. His face twitched, as \noften happens to soldiers called before the \nranks. \n\nNapoleon slightly turned his head, and put \nhis plump little hand out behind him as if to \ntake something. The members of his suite, guess- \ning at once what he wanted, moved about and \nwhispered as they passed something from one \nto another, and a page the same one Rost6v \nhad seen the previous evening at Boris' -ran \nforward and, bowing respectfully over the out- \nstretched hand and not keeping it waiting a \nmoment, laid in it an Order on a red ribbon. \nNapoleon, without looking, pressed two fingers \ntogether and the badge was between them. \nThen he approached Ldzarev (who rolled his \neyes and persistently gazed at his own mon- \narch), looked round at the Emperor Alexander \nto imply that what he was now doing was done \nfor the sake of his ally, and the small white \nhand holding the Order touched one of Lza- \nrev's buttons. It was as if Napoleon knew that \nit was only necessary for his hand to deign to \ntouch that soldier's breast for the soldier to be \nforever happy, rewarded, and distinguished \nfrom everyone else in the world. Napoleon \nmerely laid the cross on Ldzarev's breast and, \ndropping his hand, turned toward Alexander \n\n\n\nBOOK FIVE \n\n\n\nas though sure that the cross would adhere \nthere. And it really did. \n\nOfficious hands, Russian and French, im- \nmediately seized the cross and fastened it to the \nuniform. Ldzarev glanced morosely at the lit- \ntle man with white hands who was doing some- \nthing to him and, still standing motionless pre- \nsenting arms, looked again straight into Alex- \nander's eyes, as if asking whether he should \nstand there, or go away, or do something else. \nBut receiving no orders, he remained for some \ntime in that rigid position. \n\nThe Emperors remounted and rode away. \nThe Preobrazhe*nsk battalion, breaking rank, \nmingled with the French Guards and sat down \nat the tables prepared for them. \n\nLazarev sat in the place of honor. Russian \nand French officers embraced him, congratulat- \ned him, and pressed his hands. Crowds of offi- \ncers and civilians drew near merely to see him. \nA rumble of Russian and French voices and \nlaughter filled the air round the tables in the \nsquare. Two officers with flushed faces, look- \ning cheerful and happy, passed by Rost6v. \n\n"What d'you think of the treat? All on silver \nplate," one of them was saying. "Have you seen \nLazarev?" \n\n"I have." \n\n"Tomorrow, I hear, the Preobrazhnskiswill \ngive them a dinner." \n\n"Yes, but what luck for Ldzarev! Twelve \nhundred francs' pension for life." \n\n"Here's a cap, lads!" shouted a Preobraz- \nhdnsk soldier, donning a shaggy French cap. \n\n"It's a fine thing! First-rate!" \n\n"Have you heard the password?" asked one \nGuards' officer of another. "The day before yes- \nterday it was 'Napoldon, France, bravoure'; \nyesterday, 'Alexandre, Russie, grandeur.' One \nday our Emperor gives it and next day Napo- \nleon. Tomorrow our Emperor will send a St. \nGeorge's Cross to the bravest of the French \nGuards. It has to be done. He must respond in \nkind." \n\nBorfs, too, with his friend Zhilfnski, came to \nsee the Preobrazhdnsk banquet. On his way \nback, he noticed Rost6v standing by the cor- \nner of a house. \n\n"Rost6v! How d'you do? We missed one an- \nother," he said, and could not refrain from ask- \ning what was the matter, so strangely dismal \nand troubled was Rost6v's face. \n\n"Nothing, nothing," replied Rost6v. \n\n"You'll call round?" \n\n"Yes, I will." \n\nRost6v stood at that corner for a long time, \n\n\n\nwatching the feast from a distance. In his mind, \na painful process was going on which he could \nnot bring to a conclusion. Terrible doubts rose \nin his soul. Now he remembered Denisov with \nhis changed expression, his submission, and the \nwhole hospital, with arms and legs torn off and \nits dirt and disease. So vividly did he recall that \nhospital stench of dead flesh that he looked \nround to see where the smell came from. Next \nhe thought of that self-satisfied Bonaparte, \nwith his small white hand, who was now an Em- \nperor, liked and respected by Alexander. Then \nwhy those severed arms and legs and those dead \nmen? . . . Then again he thought of Ldzarev re- \nwarded and Denfsov punished and unpar- \ndoned. He caught himself harboring such \nstrange thoughts that he was frightened. \n\nThe smell of the food the Preobrazhnskis \nwere eating and a sense of hunger recalled him \nfrom these reflections; he had to get something \nto eat before going away. He went to a hotel he \nhad noticed that morning. There he found so \nmany people, among them officers who, like \nhimself, had come in civilian clothes, that he \nhad difficulty in getting a dinner. Two officers \nof his own division joined him. The conversa- \ntion naturally turned on the peace. The offi- \ncers, his comrades, like most of the army, were \ndissatisfied with the peace concluded after the \nbattle of Friedland. They said that had we held \nout a little longer Napoleon would have been \ndone for, as his troops had neither provisions \nnor ammunition. Nicholas ate and drank \n(chiefly the latter) in silence. He finished a \ncouple of bottles of wine by himself. The pro- \ncess in his mind went on tormenting him with- \nout reaching a conclusion. He feared to give \nway to his thoughts, yet could not get rid of \nthem. Suddenly, on one of the officers' saying \nthat it was humiliating to look at the French, \nRostov began shouting with uncalled-for wrath, \nand therefore much to the surprise of the offi- \ncers: \n\n"How can you judge what's best?" he cried, \nthe blood suddenly rushing to his face. "How \ncan you judge the Emperor's actions? What \nright have we to argue? We cannot compre- \nhend either the Emperor'saims or his actions!" \n\n"But I never said a word about the Emper- \nor!" said the officer, justifying himself, and un- \nable to understand Rostov's outburst, except \non the supposition that he was drunk. \n\nBut Rost6v did not listen to him. \n\n"We are not diplomatic officials, we are sol- \ndiers and nothing more," he went on. "If we \nare ordered to die, we must die. If we're pun- \n\n\n\n234 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nished, it means that we have deserved it, it's \nnot for us to judge. If the Emperor pleases to \nrecognize Bonaparte as Emperor and to con- \nclude an alliance with him, it means that that \nis the right thing to do. If once we begin judg- \ning and arguing about everything, nothing sa- \ncred will be left! That way we shall be saying \nthere is no God nothing!" shouted Nicholas, \nbanging the table very little to the point as it \nseemed to his listeners, but quite relevantly to \nthe course of his own thoughts. \n\n"Our business is to do our duty, to fight and \nnot to think! That's all " said he. \n\n"And to drink/' said one of the officers, not \nwishing to quarrel. \n\n"Yes, and to drink, "assented Nicholas. "Hul- \nlo there! Another bottle!" he shouted. \n\nIn 1808 the Emperor Alexander went to Er- \nfurt for a fresh interview with the Emperor Na- \npoleon, and in the upper circles of Petersburg \nthere was much talk of the grandeur of this \nimportant meeting. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII \n\nIn 1809 the intimacy between "the world's \ntwo arbiters," as Napoleon and Alexander were \ncalled, was such that when Napoleon declared \nwar on Austria a Russian corps crossed the \nfrontier to co-operate with our old enemy \nBonaparte against our old ally the Emperor of \nAustria, and in court circles the possibility of \nmarriage between Napoleon and one of Al- \nexander's sisters was spoken of. But besides \nconsiderations of foreign policy, the attention \nof Russian society was at that time keenly di- \nrected on the internal changes that were being \nundertaken in all the departments of govern- \nment. \n\nLife meanwhile real life, with its essential \ninterests of health and sickness, toil and rest, \nand its intellectual interests in thought, sci- \nence, poetry, music, love, friendship, hatred, \nand passions went on as usual, independently \nof and apart from political friendship or en- \nmity with Napoleon Bonaparte and from all \nthe schemes of reconstruction. \n\n\n\nBook Six: 1808-10 \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I \n\nPRINCE ANDREW had spent two years continu- \nously in the country. \n\nAll the plans Pierre had attempted on his es- \ntatesand constantly changing from one thing \nto another had never accomplishedwere car- \nried out by Prince Andrew without display and \nwithout perceptible difficulty. \n\nHe had in the highest degree a practical te- \nnacity which Pierre lacked, and without fuss \nor strain on his part this set things going. \n\nOn one of his estates the three hundred serfs \nwere liberated and became free agricultural \nlaborers this being one of the first examples \nof the kind in Russia. On other estates the \nserfs' compulsory labor was commuted for a \nquitrent. A trained midwife was engaged for \nBogucharovo at his expense, and a priest was \npaid to teach reading and writing to the chil- \ndren of the peasants and household serfs. \n\nPrince Andrew spent half his time at Bald \nHills with his father and his son, who was still \nin the care of nurses. The other half he spent \nin "Bogucharovo Cloister/' as his father called \nPrince Andrew's estate. Despite the indiffer- \nence to the affairs of the world he had expressed \nto Pierre, he diligently followed all that went \non, received many books, and to his surprise \nnoticed that when he or his father had visitors \nfrom Petersburg, the very vortex of life, these \npeople lagged behind himself who never left \nthe country in knowledge of what was hap- \npening in home and foreign affairs. \n\nBesides being occupied with his estates and \nreading a great variety of books, Prince An- \ndrew was at this time busy with a critical sur- \nvey of our last two unfortunate campaigns, and \nwith drawing up a proposal for a reform of the \narmy rules and regulations. \n\nIn the spring of 1 809 he went to visit the Ry- \nazdn estates which had been inherited by his \nson, whose guardian he was. \n\nWarmed by the spring sunshine he sat in \nthe caliche looking at the new grass, the first \nleaves on th birches, and the first puffs of \n\n\n\nwhite spring clouds floating across the clear \nblue sky. He was not thinking of anything, but \nlooked absent-mindedly and cheerfully from \nside to side. \n\nThey crossed the ferry where he had talked \nwith Pierre the year before. They went through \nthe muddy village, past threshing floors and \ngreen fields of winter rye, downhill where snow \nstill lodged near the bridge, uphill where the \nclay had been liquefied by the rain, past strips \nof stubble land and bushes touched with green \nhere and there, and into a birch forest grow- \ning on both sides of the road. In the forest it \nwas almost hot, no wind could be felt. The \nbirches with their sticky green leaves were mo- \ntionless, and lilac-colored flowers and the first \nblades of green grass were pushing up and \nlifting last year's leaves. The coarse evergreen \ncolor of the small fir trees scattered here and \nthere among the birches was an unpleasant re- \nminder of winter. On entering the forest the \nhorses began to snort and sweated visibly. \n\nPeter the footman made some remark to the \ncoachman; the latter assented. But apparently \nthe coachman's sympathy was not enough for \nPeter, and he turned on the box toward his \nmaster. \n\n"How pleasant it is, your excellency!" he said \nwith a respectful smile. \n\n"What?" \n\n"It's pleasant, your excellency!" \n\n"What is he talking about?" thought Prince \nAndrew. "Oh, the spring, I suppose," he \nthought as he turned round. "Yes, really every- \nthing is green already. . . . How early! The \nbirches and cherry and alders too are coming \nout. . . . But the oaks show no sign yet. Ah, here \nis one oak!" \n\nAt the edge of the road stood an oak. Prob- \nably ten times the age of the birches that formed \nthe forest, it was ten times as thick and twice as \ntall as they. It was an enormous tree, its girth \ntwice as great as a man could embrace, and evi- \ndently long ago some of its branches had been \nbroken off and its bark scarred. With its huge \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nungainly limbs sprawling unsymmetrically, \nand its gnarled hands and fingers, it stood an \naged, stern, and scornful monster among the \nsmiling birch trees. Only the dead-looking ev- \nergreen firs dotted about in the forest, and this \noak, refused to yield to the charm of spring or \nnotice either the spring or the sunshine. \n\n"Spring, love, happiness!" this oak seemed to \nsay. "Are you not weary of that stupid, mean- \ningless, constantly repeated fraud? Always the \nsame and always a fraud! There is no spring, \nno sun, no happiness! Look at those cramped \ndead firs, ever the same, and at me too, stick- \ning out my broken and barked fingers just \nwhere they have grown, whether from my back \nor my sides: as they have grown so I stand, and \nI do not believe in your hopes and your lies." \n\nAs he passed through the forest Prince An- \ndrew turned several times to look at that oak, \nas if expecting something from it. Under the \noak, too, were flowers and grass, but it stood \namong them scowling, rigid, misshapen, and \ngrim as ever. \n\n"Yes, the oak is right, a thousand times right," \nthought Prince Andrew. "Let others the young \nyield afresh to that fraud, but we know life, \nour life is finished!" \n\nA whole sequence of new thoughts, hopeless \nbut mournfully pleasant, rose in his soul in \nconnection with that tree. During this journey \nhe, as it were, considered his life afresh and ar- \nrived at his old conclusion, restful in its hope- \nlessness: that it was not for him to begin any- \nthing anew but that he must live out his life, \ncontent to do no harm, and not disturbing \nhimself or desiring anything. \n\nCHAPTER II \n\nPRINCE ANDREW had to see the Marshal of the \nNobility for the district in connection with the \naffairs of the Ryazan estate of which he was \ntrustee. This Marshal was Count Ilyd Rost6v, \nand in the middle of May Prince Andrew went \nto visit him. \n\nIt was now hot spring weather. The whole \nforest was already clothed in green. It was \ndusty and so hot that on passing near water one \nlonged to bathe. \n\nPrince Andrew, depressed and preoccupied \nwith the business about which he had to speak \nto the Marshal, was driving up the avenue in \nthe grounds of the Rost6vs' house at Otradnoe. \nHe heard merry girlish cries behind some trees \non the right and saw a group of girls running to \ncross the path of his caliche. Ahead of the rest \nand nearer to him ran a dark-haired, remark- \n\n\n\nably slim, pretty girl in a yellow chintz dress, \nwiih a white handkerchief on her head from \nunder which loose locks of hair escaped. The \ngirl was shouting something but, seeing that he \nwas a stranger, ran back laughing without look- \ning at him. \n\nSuddenly, he did not know why, he felt a \npang. The day was so beautiful, the sun so \nbright, everything around so gay, but that slim \npretty girl did not know, or wish to know, of \nhis existence and was contented and cheerful \nin her own separate probably foolish but \nbright and happy life. "What is she so glad \nabout? What is she thinking of? Not of the mil- \nitary regulations or of the arrangement of the \nRyazan serfs' quitrents. Of what is she think- \ning? Why is she so happy?" Prince Andrew \nasked himself with instinctive curiosity. \n\nIn 1809 Count Ilyd Rost6v was living at \nOtrddnoe just as he had done in former years, \nthat is, entertaining almost the whole province \nwith hunts, theatricals, dinners, and music. He \nwas glad to see Prince Andrew, as he was to \nsee any new visitor, and insisted on his staying \nthe night. \n\nDuring the dull day, in the course of which \nhe was entertained by his elderly hosts and by \nthe more important of the visitors (the old \ncount's house was crowded on account of an \napproaching name day), Prince Andrew repeat- \nedly glanced at Natisha, gay and laughing \namong the younger members of the company, \nand asked himself each time, "What is she \nthinking about? Why is she so glad?" \n\nThat night, alone in new surroundings, he \nwas long unable to sleep. He read awhile and \nthen put out his candle, but relit it. It was hot \nin the room, the inside shutters of which were \nclosed. He was cross with the stupid old man \n(as he called Rost6v), who had made him stay \nby assuring him that some necessary documents \nhad not yet arrived from town, and he was vexed \nwith himself for having stayed. \n\nHe got up and went to the window to open \nit. As soon as he opened the shutters the moon- \nlight, as if it had long been watching for this, \nburst into the room. He opened the casement. \nThe night was fresh, bright, and very still. Just \nbefore the window was a row of pollard trees, \nlooking black on one side and with a silvery \nlight on the other. Beneath the trees grew some \nkind of lush, wet, bushy vegetation with silver- \nlit leaves and stems here and there. Farther \nback beyond the dark trees a roof glittered with \ndew, to the right was a leafy tree with brilliant- \nly white trunk and branches, and above it shone \n\n\n\nBOOK SIX \n\n\n\n237 \n\n\n\nthe moon, nearly at its full, in a pale, almost \nstarless, spring sky. Prince Andrew leaned his \nelbows on the window ledge and his eyes rested \non that sky. \n\nHis room was on the first floor. Those in the \nrooms above were also awake. He heard female \nvoices overhead. \n\n"Just once more," said a girlish voice above \nhim which Prince Andrew recognized at once. \n\n"But when are you coming to bed?" replied \nanother voice. \n\n"I won't, I can't sleep, what's the use? Come \nnow for the last time." \n\nTwo girlish voices sang a musical passage \nthe end of some song. \n\n"Oh,howlovelyl Now go to sleep, and there's \nan end of it." \n\n"You go to sleep, but I can't," said the first \nvoice, coming nearer to the window. She was \nevidently leaning right out, for the rustle of \nher dress and even her breathing could be \nheard. Everything was stone-still, like the moon \nand its light and the shadows. Prince Andrew, \ntoo, dared not stir, for fear of betraying his un- \nintentional presence. \n\n"S6nyal S6nyal" he again heard the first \nspeaker. "Oh, how can you sleep? Only look \nhow glorious it is! Ah, how glorious! Do wake \nup, S6nya!" she said almost with tears in her \nvoice. "There never, never was such a lovely \nnight before!" \n\nS6nya made some reluctant reply. \n\n"Do just come and see what a moon! . . . Oh, \nhow lovely! Come here. . . . Darling, sweet- \nheart, come here! There, you see? I feel like \nsitting down on my heels, putting my arms \nround my knees like this, straining tight, as \ntight as possible, and flying away! Like this " \n\n"Take care, you'll fall out." \n\nHe heard the sound of a scuffle and S6nya's \ndisapproving voice: "It's past one o'clock." \n\n"Oh, you only spoil things for me. All right, \n\ngo&gt;g ! " \n\nAgain all was silent, but Prince Andrew \nknew she was still sitting there. From time to \ntime he heard a soft rustle and at times a sigh. \n\n"O God, O God! What does it mean?" she \nsuddenly exclaimed. "To bed then, if it must \nbe!" and she slammed the casement. \n\n"For her I might as well not exist!" thought \nPrince Andrew while he listened to her voice, \nfor some reason expecting yet fearing that she \nmight say something about him. "There she is \nagain! As if it were on purpose," thought he. \n\nIn his soul there suddenly arose such an un- \nexpected turmoil of youthful thoughts and \n\n\n\nhopes, contrary to the whole tenor of his life, \nthat unable to explain his condition to himself \nhe lay down and fell asleep at once. \n\nCHAPTER III \n\nNEXT MORNING, having taken leave of no one \nbut the count, and not waiting for the ladies to \nappear, Prince Andrew set off for home. \n\nIt was already the beginning of June when \non his return journey he drove into the birch \nforest where the gnarled old oak had made so \nstrange and memorable an impression on him. \nIn the forest the harness bells sounded yet more , \nmuffled than they had done six weeks before, \nfor now all was thick, shady, and dense, and \nthe young firs dotted about in the forest did not \njar on the general beauty but, lending them* \nselves to the mood around, were delicately \ngreen with fluffy young shoots. \n\nThe whole day had been hot. Somewhere a \nstorm was gathering, but only a small cloud . \nhad scattered some raindrops lightly, sprin- \nkling the road and the sappy leaves. The left \nside of the forest was dark in the shade, the \nright side glittered in the sunlight, wet and \nshiny and scarcely swayed by the breeze. Every- \nthing was in blossom, the nightingales trilled, \nand their voices reverberated now near, now \nfar away. \n\n"Yes, here in this forest was that oak with \nwhich I agreed," thought Prince Andrew. "But \nwhere is it?" he again wondered, gazing at the \nleft side of the road, and without recognizing \nit he looked with admiration at the very oak \nhe sought. The old oak, quite transfigured, \nspreading out a canopy of sappy dark-green \nfoliage, stood rapt and slightly trembling in the \nrays of the evening sun. Neither gnarled fin- \ngers nor old scars nor old doubts and sorrows \nwere any of them in evidence now. Through \nthe hard century-old bark, even where there \nwere no twigs, leaves had sprouted such as one \ncould hardly believe the old veteran could have \nproduced. \n\n"Yes, it is the same oak," thought Prince An- \ndrew, and all at once he was seized by an un- \nreasoning springtime feeling of joy and renew- \nal. All the best moments of his life suddenly \nrose to his memory. Austerlitz with the lofty \nheavens, his wife's dead reproachful face, \nPierre at the ferry, that girl thrilled by the \nbeauty of the night, and that night itself and \nthe moon, and ... all this rushed suddenly to \nhis mind. \n\n"No, life is not over at thirty-one!" Prince \nAndrew suddenly decided finally and decisively. \n\n\n\n838 \n\n"It is not enough for me to know what I have \nin me everyone must know it: Pierre, and \nthat young girl who wanted to fly away into the \nsky, everyone must know me, so that my life \nmay not be lived for myself alone while others \nlive so apart from it, but so that it may be re- \nflected in them all, and they and I may live in \nharmony!" \n\n\n\nOn reaching home Prince Andrew decided \nto go to Petersburg that autumn and found all \nsorts of reasons for this decision. A whole series \nof sensible and logical considerations showing \nit to be essential for him to go to Petersburg, \nand even to re-enter the service, kept spring- \ning up in his mind. He could not now under- \nstand how he could ever even have doubted the \nnecessity of taking an active share in life, just \nas a month before he had not understood how \nthe idea of leaving the quiet country could \never enter his head. It now seemed clear to him \nthat all his experience of life must be senseless- \nly wasted unless he applied it to some kind of \nwork and again played an active part in life. \nHe did not even remember how formerly, on \nthe strength of similar wretched logical argu- \nments, it had seemed obvious that he would \nbe degrading himself if he now, after the les- \nsons he had had in life, allowed himself to be- \nlieve in the possibility of being useful and in \nthe possibility of happiness or love. Nowreason \nsuggested quite the opposite. After that jour- \nney to Ryazan he found the country dull; his \nformer pursuits no longer interested him, and \noften when sitting alone in his study he got up, \nwent to the mirror, and gazed a long time at his \nown face. Then he would turn away to the por- \ntrait of his dead Lise, who with hair curled a la \ngrecque looked tenderly and gaily at him out \nof the gilt frame. She did not now say those \nformer terrible words to him, but looked sim- \nply, merrily, and inquisitively at him. And \nPrince Andrew, crossing his arms behind him, \nJong paced the room, now frowning, now smil- \ning, as he reflected on those irrational, inex- \npressible thoughts, secret as a crime, which al- \ntered his whole life and were connected with \nPierre, with fame, with the girl at the window, \nthe oak, and woman's beauty and love. And if \nanyone came into his room at such moments \nhe was particularly cold, stern, and above all \nunpleasantly logical. \n\n"My dear," Princess Mary entering at such a \nmoment would say, "little Nicholas can't go \nout today, it's very cold." \n\n"If it were hot," Prince Andrew would reply \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\nat such times very dryly to his sister, "he could \ngo out in his smock, but as it is cold he must \nwear warm clothes, which were designed for \nthat purpose. That is what follows from the \nfact that it is cold; and not that a child who \nneeds fresh air should remain at home," he \nwould add with extreme logic, as if punishing \nsomeone for those secret illogical emotions that \nstirred within him. \n\nAt such moments Princess Mary would think \nhow intellectual work dries men up. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV \n\nPRINCE ANDREW arrived in Petersburg in Au- \ngust, 1809. It was the time when the youthful \nSperdnski was at the zenith of his fame and his \nreforms were being pushed forward with the \ngreatest energy. That same August the Emper- \nor was thrown from his cal&amp;che, injured his leg, \nand remained three weeks at Peterhof, receiv- \ning Speranski every day and no one else. At \nthat time the two famous decrees were being \nprepared that so agitated societyabolishing \ncourt ranks and introducing examinations to \nqualify for the grades of Collegiate Assessor \nand State Councilorand not merely these but \na whole state constitution, intended to change \nthe existing order of government in Russia: le- \ngal, administrative, and financial, from the \nCouncil of State down to the district tribunals. \nNow those vague liberal dreams with which the \nEmperor Alexander had ascended the throne, \nand which he had tried to put into effect with \nthe aid of his associates, Czartoryski, Novosflt- \nsev, Kochubdy, and Str6ganov whom he him- \nself in jest had called his Comitd desalut public \nwere taking shape and being realized. \n\nNow all these men were replaced by Speran- \nski on the civil side, and Arakche"ev on the mili- \ntary. Soon after his arrival Prince Andrew, as \na gentleman of the chamber, presented himself \nat court and at a levee. The Emperor, though \nhe met him twice, did not favor him with a \nsingle word. It had always seemed to Prince \nAndrew before that he was antipathetic to the \nEmperor and that the latter disliked his face \nand personality generally, and in the cold, re- \npellent glance the Emperor gave him, he now \nfound further confirmation of this surmise. \nThe courtiers explained the Emperor's neglect \nof him by His Majesty's displeasure at Bol- \nk6nski's not having served since 1805. \n\n"I know myself that one cannot help one's \nsympathies and antipathies," thought Prince \nAndrew, "so it will not do to present my pro- \nposal for the reform of the army regulations to \n\n\n\nBOOK SIX \n\n\n\nthe Emperor personally, but the project will \nspeak for itself." \n\nHe mentioned what he had written to an \nold field marshal, a friend of his father's. The \nfield marshal made an appointment to see him, \nreceived him graciously, and promised to in- \nform the Emperor. A few days later Prince An- \ndrew received notice that he was to go to see \nthe Minister of War, Count Arakchev. \n\nOn the appointed day Prince Andrew en- \ntered Count Arakchev's waiting room at nine \nin the morning. \n\nHe did not know Arakch^ev personally, had \nnever seen him, and all he had heard of him in- \nspired him with but little respect for the man. \n\n"He is Minister of War, a man trusted by the \nEmperor, and I need not concern myself about \nhis personal qualities: he has been commis- \nsioned to consider my project, so he alone can \nget it adopted/' thought Prince Andrew as he \nwaited among a number of important and un- \nimportant people in Count Arakchev's wait- \ning room. \n\nDuring his service, chiefly as an adjutant, \nPrince Andrew had seen the anterooms of many \nimportant men, and the different types of such \nrooms were well known to him. Count Arak- \nch^ev's anteroom had quite a special character. \nThe faces of the unimportant people awaiting \ntheir turn for an audience showed embarrass- \nment and servility; the faces of those of higher \nrank expressed a common feeling of awkward- \nness, covered by a mask of unconcern and rid- \nicule of themselves, their situation, and the per- \nson for whom they were waiting. Some walked \nthoughtfully up and down, others whispered \nand laughed. Prince Andrew heard the nick- \nname "SilaAndr^evich" 1 and the words, "Uncle \nwill give it to us hot," in reference to Count \nArakch^ev. One general (an important per- \nsonage), evidently feeling offended at having \nto wait so long, sat crossing and uncrossing his \nlegs and smiling contemptuously to himself. \n\nBut the moment the door opened one feel- \ning alone appeared on all faces that of fear. \nPrince Andrew for the second time asked the \nadjutant on duty to take in his name, but re- \nceived an ironical look and was told that his \nturn would come in due course. After some \nothers had been shown in and out of the min- \nister's room by the adjutant on duty, an officer \nwho struck Prince Andrew by his humiliated \nand frightened air was admitted at that terri- \nble door. This officer's audience lasted a long \n\nl Sila means "force." \n\n\n\ntime. Then suddenly the grating sound of a \nharsh voice was heard from the other side of \nthe door, and the officer-with pale face and \ntrembling lips came out and passed through \nthe waiting room, clutching his head. \n\nAfter this Prince Andrew was conducted to \nthe door and the officer on duty said in a whis- \nper, "To the right, at the window." \n\nPrince Andrew entered a plain tidy room \nand saw at the table a man of forty with a long \nwaist, a long closely cropped head, deep wrin- \nkles, scowling brows above dull greenish-hazel \neyes and an overhanging red nose. Arakch^ev \nturned his head toward him without looking at \nhim. \n\n"What is your petition?" asked Arakchdev. \n\n"I am not petitioning, your excellency," re- \nturned Prince Andrew quietly. \n\nArakchev's eyes turned toward him. \n\n"Sit down," said he. "Prince Bolk6nski?" \n\n"I am not petitioning about anything. His \nMajesty the Emperor has deigned to send your \nexcellency a project submitted by me . . ." \n\n"You see, my dear sir, I have read your proj- \nect," interrupted Arakch^ev, uttering only the \nfirst words amiably and then again without \nlooking at Prince Andrew relapsing gradual- \nly into a tone of grumbling contempt. "You \nare proposing new military laws? There are \nmany laws but no one to carry out the old ones. \nNowadays everybody designs laws, it is easier \nwriting than doing." \n\n"I came at His Majesty the Emperor's wish \nto learn from your excellency how you propose \nto deal with the memorandum I have present- \ned," said Prince Andrew politely. \n\n"I have endorsed a resolution on your mem- \norandum and sent it to the committee. I do not \napprove of it," said Arakch^ev, rising and tak- \ning a paper from his writing table. "Here!" \nand he handed it to Prince Andrew. \n\nAcross the paper was scrawled in pencil, \nwithout capital letters, misspelled, and with- \nout punctuation: "Unsoundly constructed be- \ncause resembles an imitation of the French mil- \nitary code and from the Articles of War need- \nlessly deviating." \n\n"To what committee has the memorandum \nbeen referred?" inquired Prince Andrew. \n\n"To the Committee on Army Regulations, \nand I have recommended that your honor \nshould be appointed a member, but without a \nsalary." \n\nPrince Andrew smiled. \n\n"I don't want one." \n\n"A member without salary," repeated Arak- \n\n\n\n240 WAR AND PEACE \n\nchev. "I have the honor . . . Ehl Call the next \none! Who else is there?" he shouted, bowing to \nPrince Andrew. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER V \n\nWHILE WAITING for the announcement of his \nappointment to the committee Prince Andrew \nlooked up his former acquaintances, particu- \nlarly those he knew to be in power and whose \naid he might need. In Petersburg he now ex- \nperienced the same feeling he had had on the \neve of a battle, when troubled by anxious cu- \nriosity and irresistibly attracted to the ruling \ncircles where the future, on which the fate of \nmillions depended, was beingshaped. From the \nirritation of the older men, the curiosity of the \nuninitiated, the reserve of the initiated, the \nhurry and preoccupation of everyone, and the \ninnumerable committees and commissions of \nwhose existence he learned every day, he felt \nthat now, in 1809, here in Petersburg a vast \ncivil conflict was in preparation, the command- \ner in chief of which was a mysterious person he \ndid not know, but who was supposed to be a \nman of genius Speranski. And this movement \nof reconstruction of which Prince Andrew had \na vague idea, and Sperdnski its chief promoter, \nbegan to interest him so keenly that the ques- \ntion of the army regulations quickly receded to \na secondary place in his consciousness. \n\nPrince Andrew was most favorably placed to \nsecure a good reception in the highest and most \ndiverse Petersburg circles of the day. The re- \nforming party cordially welcomed and courted \nhim, in the first place because he was reputed to \nbe clever and very well read, and secondly be- \ncause by liberating his serfs he had obtained \nthe reputation of being a liberal. The party of \nthe old and dissatisfied, who censured the in- \nnovations, turned to him expecting his sympa- \nthy in their disapproval of the reforms, simply \nbecause he was the son of his father. The fem- \ninine society world welcomed him gladly, be- \ncause he was rich, distinguished, a good match, \nand almost a newcomer, with a halo of romance \non account of his supposed death and the tragic \nloss of his wife. Besides this the general opin- \nion of all who had known him previously was \nthat he had greatly improved during these last \nfive years, having softened and grown more \nmanly, lost his former affectation, pride, and \ncontemptuous irony, and acquired the serenity \nthat comes with years. People talked about \nhim, were interested in him, and wanted to \nmeet him. \n\nThe day after his interview with Count Ar- \n\n\n\nakch^ev, Prince Andrew spent the evening at \nCount Kochub^y's. He told the count of his \ninterview with Sila Andre evich (Kochube*y \nspoke of Arakche*ev by that nickname with the \nsame vague irony Prince Andrew had noticed \nin the Minister of War's anteroom). \n\n"Mon cher f even in this case you can't do \nwithout Michael Mikhdylovich Sperdnski. He \nmanages everything. I'll speak to him. He has \npromised to come this evening." \n\n"What has Speranski to do with the army \nregulations?" asked Prince Andrew. \n\nKochube*y shook his head smilingly, as if sur- \nprised at Bolk6nski's simplicity. \n\n"We were talking to him about you a few days \nago," Kochube*y continued, "and about your \nfreed plowmen." \n\n"Oh, is it you, Prince, who have freed your \nserfs?" said an old man of Catherine's day, \nturning contemptuously toward Bolk6nski. \n\n"It was a small estate that brought in no prof- \nit," replied Prince Andrew, trying to extenuate \nhis action so as not to irritate the old man use- \nlessly. \n\n"Afraid of being late . . ." said the old man, \nlooking at Kochubdy. \n\n"There's one thing I don't understand," he \ncontinued. "Who will plow the land if they are \nset free? It is easy to write laws, but difficult to \n\nrule Just the same as now I ask you, Count \n\nwho will be heads of the departments when \neverybody has to pass examinations?" \n\n"Those who pass the examinations, I sup- \npose," replied Kochub^y, crossing his legs and \nglancing round. \n\n"Well, I have Prydniclmikov serving under \nme, a splendid man, a priceless man, but he's \nsixty. Is he to go up for examination?" \n\n"Yes, that's a difficulty, as education is not at \nall general, but . . ." \n\nCount Kochub^ydid not finish. He rose, took \nPrince Andrew by the arm, and went to meet \na tall, bald, fair man of about forty with a \nlarge open forehead and a long face of unusu- \nal and peculiar whiteness, who was just enter- \ning. The newcomer wore a blue swallow-tail \ncoat with a cross suspended from his neck and a \nstar on his left breast. It was Sperdnski. Prince \nAndrew recognized him at once, and felt a \nthrob within him, as happens at critical mo- \nments of life. Whether it was from respect, en- \nvy, or anticipation, he did not know. Speran- \nski's whole figure was of a peculiar type that \nmade him easily recognizable. In the society in \nwhich Prince Andrew lived he had never seen \nanyone who together with awkward and clum- \n\n\n\nBOOK SIX \n\n\n\nsy gestures possessed such calmness and self- \nassurance; he had never seen so resolute yet \ngentle an expression as that in those half-closed, \nrather humid eyes, or so firm a smile that ex- \npressed nothing; nor had he heard such a re- \nfined, smooth, soft voice; above all he had nev- \ner seen such delicate whiteness of face or hands \nhands which were broad, but very plump, soft, \nand white. Such whiteness and softness Prince \nAndrew had only seen on the faces of soldiers \nwho had been long in hospital. This was Spe- \nrdnski, Secretary of State, reporter to the Em- \nperor and his companion at Erfurt, where he \nhad more than once met and talked with Na- \npoleon. \n\nSperdnski did not shift his eyes from one face \nto another as people involuntarily do on en- \ntering a large company and was in no hurry to \nspeak. He spoke slowly, with assurance that he \nwould be listened to, and he looked only at \nthe person with whom he was conversing. \n\nPrince Andrew followed Sperdnski's every \nword and movement with particular attention. \nAs happens to some people, especially to men \nwho judge those near to them severely, he al- \nways on meeting anyone newespecially any- \none whom, like Speranski, he knew by reputa- \ntionexpected to discover in him the perfec- \ntion of human qualities. \n\nSperanski told Kochubdy he was sorry he \nhad been unable to come sooner as he had been \ndetained at the palace. He did not say that the \nEmperor had kept him, and Prince Andrew \nnoticed this affectation of modesty. When Ko- \nchube*y introduced Prince Andrew, Sperdnski \nslowly turned his eyes to Bolk6nski with his \ncustomary smile and looked at him in silence. \n\n"I am very glad to make your acquaintance. \nI had heard of you, as everyone has," he said \nafter a pause. \n\nKochube"y said a few words about the recep- \ntion Arakch^ev had given Bolk6nski. Sperdnski \nsmiled more markedly. \n\n"The chairman of the Committee on Army \nRegulations is my good friend Monsieur Mag- \nnftski," he said, fully articulating every word \nand syllable, "and if you like I can put you in \ntouch with him." He paused at the full stop. \n"I hope you will find him sympathetic and \nready to co-operate in promoting all that is \nreasonable." \n\nA circle soon formed round Sperdnski, and \nthe old man who had talked about his subordi- \nnate Prydnichnikov addressed a question to \nhim. \n\nPrince Andrew without joining in the con- \n\n\n\nversation watched every movement of Sperdn- \nski's: this man, not long since an insignificant \ndivinity student, who now, Bolk6nski thought, \nheld in his hands those plump white hands \nthe fate of Russia. Prince Andrew was struck \nby the extraordinarily disdainful composure \nwith which Sperdnski answered the old man. \nHe appeared to address condescending words \nto him from an immeasurable height. When \nthe old man began to speak too loud, Sperdn- \nski smiled and said he could not judge of the \nadvantage or disadvantage of what pleased the \nsovereign. \n\nHaving talked for a little while in the gen- \neral circle, Sperdnski rose and coming up to \nPrince Andrew took him along to the other \nend of the room. It was clear that he thought it \nnecessary to interest himself in Bolk6nski. \n\n"I had no chance to talk with you, Prince, \nduring the animated conversation in which \nthat venerable gentleman involved me," he \nsaid with a mildly contemptuous smile, as if \nintimating by that smile that he and Prince \nAndrew understood the insignificance of the \npeople with whom he had just been talking. \nThis flattered Prince Andrew. "I have known \nof you for a long time: first from your action \nwith regard to your serfs, a first example, of \nwhich it is very desirable that there should be \nmore imitators; and secondly because you are \none of those gentlemen of the chamber who \nhave not considered themselves offended by \nthe new decree concerning the ranks allotted \nto courtiers, which is causing so much gossip \nand tittle-tattle." \n\n"No," said Prince Andrew, "my father did \nnot wish me to take advantage of the privilege. \nI began the service from the lower grade." \n\n"Your father, a man of the last century, evi- \ndently stands above our contemporaries who \nso condemn this measure which merely re- \nestablishes natural justice." \n\n"I think, however, that these condemnations \nhave some ground," returned Prince Andrew, \ntrying to resist Sperdnski's influence, of which \nhe began to be conscious. He did not like to \nagree with him in everything and felt a wish to \ncontradict. Though he usually spoke easily and \nwell, he felt a difficulty in expressing himself \nnow while talking with Sperdnski. He was too \nmuch absorbed in observing the famous man's \npersonality. \n\n"Grounds of personal ambition maybe," \nSperdnski put in quietly. \n\n"And of state interest to some extent," said \nPrince Andrew. \n\n\n\n242 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\n"What do you mean?" asked Sperdnski quiet- \nly, lowering his eyes. \n\n"I am an admirer of Montesquieu," replied \nPrince Andrew, "and his idea that le principe \ndes monarchies est I'honneur me paratt in- \ncontestable. Certains droits et privileges de la \nnoblesse me paraissent Stre des moyens de sou- \ntenir ce sentiment." * \n\nThe smile vanished from Sperdnski's white \nface, which was much improved by the change. \nProbably Prince Andrew's thought interested \nhim. \n\n"Si vous envisagez la question sous ce point \nde vue" * he began, pronouncing French with \nevident difficulty, and speaking even slower \nthan in Russian but quite calmly. \n\nSperdnski went on to say that honor, I'hon- \nneur, cannot be upheld by privileges harmful \nto the service; that honor, I'honneur, is either \na negative concept of not doing what is blame- \nworthy or it is a source of emulation in pursuit \nof commendation and rewards, which recog- \nnize it. His arguments were concise, simple, \nand clear. \n\n"An institution upholding honor, the source \nof emulation, is one similar to the Legion \nd'honneurot the great Emperor Napoleon, not \nharmful but helpful to the success of the serv- \nice, but not a class or court privilege." \n\n"I do not dispute that, but it cannot be de- \nnied that court privileges have attained the \nsame end," returned Prince Andrew. "Every \ncourtier considers himself bound to maintain \nhis position worthily." \n\n"Yet you do not care to avail yourself of the \nprivilege, Prince," said Sperdnski, indicating \nby a smile that he wished to finish amiably an \nargument which was embarrassing for his com- \npanion. "If you will do me the honor of call- \ning on me on Wednesday," he added, "I will, \nafter talking with Magnitski, let you know \nwhat may interest you, and shall also have the \npleasure of a more detailed chat with you." \n\nClosing his eyes, he bowed a la franfaise, \nwithout taking leave, and trying to attract as \nlittle attention as possible, he left the room. \n\nCHAPTER VI \n\nDURING the first weeks of his stay in Petersburg \nPrince Andrew felt the whole trend of thought \nhe had formed during his life of seclusion quite \n\n1 "The principle of monarchies is honor seems \nto me incontestable. Certain rights and privileges \nfor the aristocracy appear to me a means of main- \ntaining that sentiment." \n\n* "If you regard the question from that point of \nview." \n\n\n\novershadowed by the trifling cares that en- \ngrossed him in that city. \n\nOn returning home in the evening he would \njot down in his notebook four or five necessary \ncalls or appointments for certain hours. The \nmechanism of life, the arrangement of the day \nso as to be in time everywhere, absorbed the \ngreater part of his vital energy. He did noth- \ning, did not even think or find time to think, \nbut only talked, and talked successfully, of \nwhat he had thought while in the country. \n\nHe sometimes noticed with dissatisfaction \nthat he repeated the same remark on the same \nday in different circles. But he was so busy for \nwhole days together that he had no time to no- \ntice that he was thinking of nothing. \n\nAs he had done on their first meeting at Ko- \nchuby's, Sperdnski produced a strong impres- \nsion on Prince Andrew on the Wednesday, \nwhen he received him tthe-d-tte at his own \nhouse and talked to him long and confiden- \ntially. \n\nTo Bolk6nski so many people appeared con- \ntemptible and insignificant creatures, and he \nso longed to find in someone the living ideal of \nthat perfection toward which he strove, that he \nreadily believed that in Sperdnski he had found \nthis ideal of a perfectly rational and virtuous \nman. Had Sperdnski sprung from the same \nclass as himself and possessed the same breed- \ning and traditions, Bolkonski would soon have \ndiscovered his weak, human, unheroic sides; \nbut as it was, Sperdnski's strange and logical \nturn of mind inspired him with respect all the \nmore because he did not quite understand him. \nMoreover, Sperdnski, either because he appre- \nciated the other's capacity or because he con- \nsidered it necessary to win him to his side, \nshowed off his dispassionate calm reasonable- \nness before Prince Andrew and flattered him \nwith that subtle flattery which goes hand in \nhand with self-assurance and consists in a tacit \nassumption that one's companion is the only \nman besides oneself capable of understanding \nthe folly of the rest of mankind and the reason- \nableness and profundity of one's own ideas. \n\nDuring their long conversation on Wednes- \nday evening, Sperdnski more than once re- \nmarked: "We regard everything that is above \nthe common level of rooted custom . . ." or, \nwith a smile: "But we want the wolves to be \nfed and the sheep to be safe . . ." or: "They \ncannot understand this . . ." and all in a way \nthat seemed to say: "We, you and I, under- \nstand what they are and who we are/' \n\nThis first long conversation with Sperdnski \n\n\n\nBOOK SIX \n\n\n\n243 \n\n\n\nonly strengthened in Prince Andrew the feel- \ning he had experienced toward him at their \nfirst meeting. He saw in him a remarkable, \nclear-thinking man of vast intellect who by \nhis energy and persistence had attained power, \nwhich he was using solely for the welfare of \nRussia. In Prince Andrew's eyes Sperdnski was \nthe man he would himself have wished to be \none who explained all the facts of life reason- \nably, considered important only what was ra- \ntional, and was capable of applying the stand- \nard of reason to everything. Every thing seemed \nso simple and clear in Sperdnski's exposition \nthat Prince Andrew involuntarily agreed with \nhim about everything. If he replied and ar- \ngued, it was only because he wished to main- \ntain his independence and not submit to Spe- \nrdnski's opinions entirely. Everything was right \nand everything was as it should be: only one \nthing disconcerted Prince Andrew. This was \nSperdnski's cold, mirrorlike look, which did \nnot allow one to penetrate to his soul, and his \ndelicate white hands, which Prince Andrew \ninvoluntarily watched as one does watch the \nhands of those who possess power. This mirror- \nlike gaze and those delicate hands irritated \nPrince Andrew, he knew not why. He was un- \npleasantly struck, too, by the excessive con- \ntempt for others that he observed in Sperdnski, \nand by the diversity of lines of argument he \nused to support his opinions. He made use of \nevery kind of mental device, except analogy, \nand passed too boldly, it seemed to Prince An- \ndrew, from one to another. Now he would take \nup the position of a practical man and con- \ndemn dreamers; now that of a satirist, and \nlaugh ironically at his opponents; now grow \nseverely logical, or suddenly rise to the realm \nof metaphysics. (This last resource was one he \nvery frequently employed.) He would transfer \na question to metaphysical heights, pass on to \ndefinitions of space, time, and thought, and, \nhaving deduced the refutation he needed, \nwould again descend to the level of the origi- \nnal discussion. \n\nIn general the trait of Sperdnski's mentality \nwhich struck Prince Andrew most was his ab- \nsolute and unshakable belief in the power and \nauthority of reason. It was evident that the \nthought could never occur to him which to \nPrince Andrew seemed so natural, namely, that \nit is after all impossible to express all one \nthinks; and that he had never felt the doubt, \n"Is not all I think and believe nonsense?" And \nit was just this peculiarity of Sperdnski's mind \nthat particularly attracted Prince Andrew. \n\n\n\nDuring the first period of their acquaintance \nBolk6nski felt a passionate admiration for him \nsimilar to that which he had once felt for \nBonaparte. The fact that Sperdnski was the \nson of a village priest, and that stupid people \nmight meanly despise him on account of his \nhumble origin (as in fact many did), caused \nPrince Andrew to cherish his sentiment for \nhim the more, and unconsciously to strengthen \nit. \n\nOn that first evening Bolk6nski spent with \nhim, having mentioned the Commission for the \nRevision of the Code of Laws, Sperdnski told \nhim sarcastically that the Commission had ex- \nisted for a hundred and fifty years, had cost \nmillions, and had done nothing except that \nRosenkampf had stuck labels on the corre- \nsponding paragraphs of the different codes. \n\n"And that is all the state has for the millions \nit has spent," said he. "We want to give the \nSenate new juridical powers, but we have no \nlaws. That is why it is a sin for men like you, \nPrince, not to serve in these times!" \n\nPrince Andrew said that for that work an \neducation in jurisprudence was needed which \nhe did not possess. \n\n"But nobody possesses it, so what would you \nhave? It is a vicious circle from which we must \nbreak a way out." \n\nA week later Prince Andrew was a member \nof the Committee on Army Regulations and \nwhat he had not at all expected was chairman \nof a section of the committee for the revision \nof the laws. At Sperdnski's request he took the \nfirst part of the Civil Code that was being \ndrawn up and, with the aid of the Code Napo- \nteon and the Institutes of Justinian, he worked \nat formulating the section on Personal Rights. \n\nCHAPTER VII \n\nNEARLY TWO YEARS before this, in 1808, Pierre \non returning to Petersburg after visiting his \nestates had involuntarily found himself in a \nleading position among the Petersburg Free- \nmasons. He arranged dining and funeral lodge \nmeetings, enrolled new members, and busied \nhimself uniting various lodges and acquiring \nauthentic charters. He gave money for the \nerection of temples and supplemented as far \nas he could the collection of alms, in regard to \nwhich the majority of members were stingy \nand irregular. He supported almost single- \nhanded a poor house the order had founded in \nPetersburg. \n\nHis life meanwhile continued as before, with \nthe same infatuations and dissipations. He \n\n\n\n244 WAR AND PEACE \n\nliked to dine and drink well, and though he \nconsidered it immoral and humiliating could \nnot resist the temptations of the bachelor cir- \ncles in which he moved. \n\nAmid the turmoil of his activities and dis- \ntractions, however, Pierre at the end of a year \nbegan to feel that the more firmly he tried to \nrest upon it, the more Masonic ground on \nwhich he stood gave way under him. At the \nsame time he felt that the deeper the ground \nsank under him the closer bound he involun- \ntarily became to the order. When he had joined \nthe Freemasons he had experienced the feel- \ning of one who confidently steps onto the \nsmooth surface of a bog. When he put his foot \ndown it sank in. To make quite sure of the \nfirmness of the ground, he put his other foot \ndown and sank deeper still, became stuck in \nit, and involuntarily waded knee-deep in the \n\nbog- \nJoseph Alex^evich was not in Petersburg- \nhe had of late stood aside from the affairs of \n"the Petersburg lodges and lived almost entirely \nin Moscow. All the members of the lodges \nwere men Pierre knew in ordinary life, and it \nwas difficult for him to regard them merely as \nBrothers in Freemasonry and not as Prince B. \nor Ivdn Vasilevich D., whom he knew in soci- \nety mostly as weak and insignificant men. Un- \nder the Masonic aprons and insignia he saw \nthe uniforms and decorations at which they \naimed in ordinary life. Often after collecting \nalms, and reckoning up twenty to thirty rubles \nreceived for the most part in promises from a \ndozen members, of whom half were as well able \nto pay as himself, Pierre remembered the \nMasonic vow in which each Brother promised \nto devote all his belongings to his neighbor, \nand doubts on which he tried not to dwell \narose in his soul. \n\nHe divided the Brothers he knew into four \ncategories. In the first he put those who did \nnot take an active part in the affairs of the \nlodges or in human affairs, but were exclusive- \nly occupied with the mystical science of the or- \nder: with questions of the threefold designa- \ntion of God, the three primordial elements- \nsulphur, mercury, and salt or the meaning of \nthe square and all the various figures of the \ntemple of Solomon. Pierre respected this class \nof Brothers to which the elder ones chiefly be- \nlonged, including, Pierre thought, Joseph \nAlexevich himself, but he did not share their \ninterests. His heart was not in the mystical as- \npect of Freemasonry. \nIn the second category Pierre reckoned him- \n\n\n\nself and others like him, seeking and vacillat- \ning, who had not yet found in Freemasonry a \nstraight and comprehensible path, but hoped \nto do so. \n\nIn the third category he included those \nBrothers (the majority) who saw nothing in \nFreemasonry but the external forms and cere- \nmonies, and prized the strict performance of \nthese forms without troubling about their pur- \nport or significance. Such were Willarski and \neven the Grand Master of the principal lodge. \n\nFinally, to the fourth category also a great \nmany Brothers belonged, particularly those \nwho had lately joined. These according to \nPierre's observations were men who had no be- \nlief in anything, nor desire for anything, but \njoined the Freemasons merely to associate with \nthe wealthy young Brothers who were influ- \nential through their connections or rank, and \nof whom there were very many in the lodge. \n\nPierre began to feel dissatisfied with what he \nwas doing. Freemasonry, at any rate as he saw \nit here, sometimes seemed to him based merely \non externals. He did not think of doubting \nFreemasonry itself, but suspected that Russian \nMasonry had taken a wrong path and deviated \nfrom its original principles. And so toward the \nend of the year he went abroad to be initiated \ninto the higher secrets of the order. \n\nIn the summer of 1809 Pierre returned to \nPetersburg. Our Freemasons knew from cor- \nrespondence with those abroad that Beziikhov \nhad obtained the confidence of many highly \nplaced persons, had been initiated into many \nmysteries, had been raised to a higher grade, \nand was bringing back with him much that \nmight conduce to the advantage of the Mason- \nic cause in Russia. The Petersburg Freemasons \nall came to see him, tried to ingratiate them- \nselves with him, and it seemed to them all that \nhe was preparing something for them and con- \ncealing it. \n\nA solemn meeting of the lodge of the second \ndegree was convened, at which Pierre promised \nto communicate to the Petersburg Brothers \nwhat he had to deliver to them from the high- \nest leaders of their order. The meeting was a \nfull one. After the usual ceremonies Pierre \nrose and began his address. \n\n"Dear Brothers," he began, blushing and \nstammering, with a written speech in his hand, \n"it is not sufficient to observe our mysteries in \nthe seclusion of our lodge we must act act! \nWe are drowsing, but we must act." Pierre \nraised his notebook and began to read. \n\n"For the dissemination of pure truth and to \n\n\n\nBOOK SIX \n\n\n\n245 \n\n\n\nsecure the triumph of virtue," he read, "we \nmust cleanse men from prejudice, diffuse prin- \nciples in harmony with the spirit of the times, \nundertake the education of the young, unite \nourselves in indissoluble bonds with the wisest \nmen, boldly yet prudently overcome supersti- \ntions, infidelity, and folly, and form of those \ndevoted to us a body linked together by unity \nof purpose and possessed of authority and \npower. \n\n"To attain this end we must secure a pre- \nponderance of virtue over vice and must en- \ndeavor to secure that the honest man may, \neven in this world, receive a lasting reward for \nhis virtue. But in these great endeavors we are \ngravely hampered by the political institutions \nof today. What is to be done in these circum- \nstances? To favor revolutions, overthrow every- \nthing, repel force by force? . . . No I We are very \nfar from that. Every violent reform deserves \ncensure, for it quite fails to remedy evil while \nmen remain what they are, and also because \nwisdom needs no violence. \n\n"The whole plan of our order should be \nbased on the idea of preparing men of firm- \nness and virtue bound together by unity of \nconviction aiming at the punishment of vice \nand folly, and patronizing talent and virtue: \nraising worthy men from the dust and attach- \ning them to our Brotherhood. Only then will \nour order have the power unobtrusively to \nbind the hands of the protectors of disorder \nand to control them without their being aware \nof it. In a word, we must found a form of gov- \nernment holding universal sway, which should \nbe diffused over the whole world without de- \nstroying the bonds of citizenship, and beside \nwhich all other governments can continue in \ntheir customary course and do everything ex- \ncept what impedes the great aim of our order, \nwhich is to obtain for virtue the victory over \nvice. This aim was that of Christianity itself. \nIt taught men to be wise and good and for \ntheir own benefit to follow the example and \ninstruction of the best and wisest men. \n\n"At that time, when everything was plunged \nin darkness, preaching alone was of course suf- \nficient. The novelty of Truth endowed her \nwith special strength, but now we need much \nmore powerful methods. It is now necessary \nthat man, governed by his senses, should find \nin virtue a charm palpable to those senses. It \nis impossible to eradicate the passions; but we \nmust strive to direct them to a noble aim, and \nit is therefore necessary that everyone should \nbe able to satisfy his passions within the limits \n\n\n\nof virtue. Our order should provide means to \nthat end. \n\n"As soon as we have a certain number of \nworthy men in every state, each of them again \ntraining two others and all being closely united, \neverything will be possible for our order, \nwhich has already in secret accomplished much \nfor the welfare of mankind." \n\nThis speech not only made a strong impres- \nsion, but created excitement in the lodge. The \nmajority of the Brothers, seeing in it dangerous \ndesigns of Illuminism, 1 met it with a coldness \nthat surprised Pierre. The Grand Master be- \ngan answering him, and Pierre began develop- \ning his views with more and more warmth. It \nwas long since there had been so stormy a meet- \ning. Parties were formed, some accusing Pierre \nof Illuminism, others supporting him. At that \nmeeting l&gt;e was struck for the first time by the \nendless variety of men's minds, which prevents \na truth from ever presenting itself identically \nto two persons. Even those members who \nseemed to be on his side understood him in \ntheir own way with limitations and alterations \nhe could not agree to, as what he always wanted \nmost was to convey his thought to others just \nas he himself understood it. \n\nAt the end of the meeting the Grand Master \nwith irony and ill-will reproved Bezukhov for \nhis vehemence and said it was not love of vir- \ntue alone, but also a love of strife that had \nmoved him in the dispute. Pierre did not an- \nswer him and asked briefly whether his pro- \nposal would be accepted. He was told that it \nwould not, and without waiting for the usual \nformalities he left the lodge and went home. \n\nCHAPTER VIII \n\nAGAIN PIERRE was overtaken by the depression \nhe so dreaded. For three days after the delivery \nof his speech at the lodge he lay on a sofa at \nhome receiving no one and going nowhere. \n\nIt was just then that he received a letter from \n"his wife, who implored him to see her, telling \nhim how grieved she was about him and how \nshe wished to devote her whole life to him. \n\nAt the end of the letter she informed him \nthat in a few days she would return to Peters- \nburg from abroad. \n\nFollowing this letter one of the Masonic \nBrothers whom Pierre respected less than the \nothers forced his way in to see him and, turn- \ning the conversation upon Pierre's matrimoni- \nal affairs, by way of fraternal advice expressed \n\n1 The Illuminati sought to substitute republican \nfor monarchical institutions. \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nthe opinion that his severity to his wife was \nwrong and that he was neglecting one of the \nfirst rules of Freemasonry by not forgiving the \npenitent. \n\nAt the same time his mother-in-law, Prince \nVasfli's wife, sent to him imploring him to \ncome if only for a few minutes to discuss a most \nimportant matter. Pierre saw that there was a \nconspiracy against him and that they wanted \nto reunite him with his wife, and in the mood \nhe then was, this was not even unpleasant to \nhim. Nothing mattered to him. Nothing in life \nseemed to him of much importance, and un- \nder the influence of the depression that pos- \nsessed him he valued neither his liberty nor his \nresolution to punish his wife. \n\n"No one is right and no one is to blame; so \nshe too is not to blame," he thought. \n\nIf he did not at once give his consent to a \nreunion with his wife, it was only because in \nhis state of depression he did not feel able to \ntake any step. Had his wife come to him, he \nwould not have turned her away. Compared to \nwhat preoccupied him, was it not a matter of \nindifference whether he lived with his wife or \nnot? \n\nWithout replying either to his wife or his \nmother-in-law, Pierre late one night prepared \nfor a journey and started for Moscow to see \nJoseph Alex^evich. This is what he noted in \nhis diary: \n\nMoscow, ijth November \n\nI have just returned from my benefactor, and \nhasten to write down what I have experienced. \nJoseph Alexevich is living poorly and has for \nthree years been suffering from a painful disease \nof the bladder. No one has ever heard him utter a \ngroan or a word of complaint. From morning till \nlate at night, except when he eats his very plain \nfood, he is working at science. He received me \ngraciously and made me sit down on the bed on \nwhich he lay. I made the sign of the Knights of \nthe East and of Jerusalem, and he responded in \nthe same manner, asking me with a mild smile \nwhat I had learned and gained in the Prussian \nand Scottish lodges. I told him everything as best \nI could, and told him what I had proposed to our \nPetersburg lodge, of the bad reception I had en- \ncountered, and of my rupture with the Brothers. \nJoseph Alexdevich, having remained silent and \nthoughtful for a good while, told me his view of \nthe matter, which at once lit up for me my whole \npast and the future path I should follow. He sur- \nprised me by asking whether I remembered the \nthreefold aim of the order: (i) The preservation \nand study of the mystery, (a) The purification and \nreformation of oneself for its reception, and (3) \nThe improvement of the human race by striving \n\n\n\nfor such purification. Which is the principal aim \nof these three? Certainly self-reformation and self- \npurification. Only to this aim can we always strive \nindependently of circumstances. But at the same \ntime just this aim demands the greatest efforts of \nus; and so, led astray by pride, losing sight of this \naim, we occupy ourselves either with the mystery \nwhich in our impurity we are unworthy to receive, \nor seek the reformation of the human race while \nourselves setting an example of baseness and prof- \nligacy. Ilium inism is not a pure doctrine, just be- \ncause it is attracted by social activity and puffed \nup by pride. On this ground Joseph Alexevich \ncondemned my speech and my whole activity, and \nin the depth of my soul I agreed with him. Talk- \ning of my family affairs he said to me, "the chief \nduty of a true Mason, as I have told you, lies in \nperfecting himself. We often think that by remov- \ning all the difficulties of our life we shall more \nquickly reach our aim, but on the contrary, my \ndear sir, it is only in the midst of worldly cares that \nwe can attain our three chief aims: (i) Self-knowl- \nedgefor man can only know himself by compari- \nson, (2) Self-perfecting, which can only be attained \nby conflict, and (3) The attainment of the chief \nvirtue love of death. Only the vicissitudes of life \ncan show us its vanity and develop our innate love \nof death or of rebirth to a new life." These words \nare all the more remarkable because, in spite of \nhis great physical sufferings, Joseph Alexeevich is \nnever weary of life though he loves death, for \nwhich in spite of the purity and loftiness of his \ninner man he does not yet feel himself sufficiently \nprepared. My benefactor then explained to me \nfully the meaning of the Great Square of creation \nand pointed out to me that the numbers three and \nseven are the basis of everything. He advised me \nnot to avoid intercourse with the Petersburg \nBrothers, but to take up only second-grade posts in \nthe lodge, to try, while diverting the Brothers \nfrom pride, to turn them toward the true path of \nself-knowledge and self-perfecting. Besides this he \nadvised me for myself personally above all to keep \na watch over myself, and to that end he gave me \na notebook, the one I am now writing in and in \nwhich I will in future note down all my actions. \n\nPetersburg, 2}rd November \n\nI am again living with my wife. My mother-in- \nlaw came to me in tears and said that Helene was \nhere and that she implored me to hear her; that \nshe was innocent and unhappy at my desertion, \nand much more. I knew that if I once let myself \nsee her I should not have strength to go on refus- \ning what she wanted. In my perplexity I did not \nknow whose aid and advice to seek. Had my bene- \nfactor been here he would have told me what to \ndo. I went to my room and reread Joseph Alexe- \nvich's letters and recalled my conversations with \nhim, and deduced from it all that I ought not to \nrefuse a suppliant, and ought to reach a helping \nhand to everyone especially to one so closely \n\n\n\nbound to me and that I must bear my cross. \nBut if I forgive her for the sake of doing right, \nthen let union with her have only a spiritual aim. \nThat is what I decided, and what I wrote to Joseph \nAlexe"evich. I told my wife that I begged her to \nforget the past, to forgive me whatever wrong I \nmay have done her, and that I had nothing to for- \ngive. It gave me joy to tell her this. She need not \nknow how hard it was for me to see her again. I \nhave settled on the upper floor of this big house \nand am experiencing a happy feeling of regenera- \ntion. \n\nCHAPTER IX \n\nAT THAT TIME, as always happens, the highest \nsociety that met at court and at the grand balls \nwas divided into several circles, each with its \nown particular tone. The largest of these was \nthe French circle of the Napoleonic alliance, \nthe circle of Count Rumydntsev and Caulain- \ncourt. In this group HeUene, as soon as she had \nsettled in Petersburg with her husband, took a \nvery prominent place. She was visited by the \nmembers of the French embassy and by many \nbelonging to that circle and noted for their in- \ntellect and polished manners. \n\nHellene had been at Erfurt during the fa- \nmous meeting of the Emperors and had brought \nfrom there these connections with the Napole- \nonic notabilities. At Erfurt her success had been \nbrilliant. Napoleon himself had noticed her in \nthe theater and said of her: "C'est un superbe \nanimal." l Her success as a beautiful and ele- \ngant woman did not surprise Pierre, for she \nhad become even handsomer than before. What \ndid surprise him was that during these last two \nyears his wife had succeeded in gaining the \nreputation "d' une femme charmante, aussi \nspirituelle que belle." 3 The distinguished \nPrince de Ligne wrote her eight-page letters. \nBilibin saved up his epigrams to produce them \nin Countess Bezukhova's presence. To be re- \nceived in the Countess Bezukhova's salon was \nregarded as a diploma of intellect Young men \nread books before attending Hlne's evenings, \nto have something to say in her salon, and \nsecretaries of the embassy, and even ambassa- \ndors, confided diplomatic secrets to her, so that \nin a way Hdene was a power. Pierre, who knew \nshe was very stupid, sometimes attended, with \na strange feeling of perplexity and fear, her \nevenings and dinner parties, where politics, \npoetry, and philosophy were discussed. At these \nparties his feelings were like those of a con- \n\n1 "That's a superb animal." \n""Of a charming woman, as witty as she is \nlovely." \n\n\n\nBOOK SIX 247 \n\njuror who always expects his trick to be found \n\n\n\nout at any moment. But whether because stu- \npidity was just what was needed to run such a \nsalon, or because those who were deceived \nfound pleasure in the deception, at any rate it \nremained unexposed and Hlene Bezukhova's \nreputation as a lovely and clever woman be- \ncame so firmly established that she could say \nthe emptiest and stupidest things andyet every- \nbody would go into raptures over every word \nof hers and look for a profound meaning in it \nof which she herself had no conception. \n\nPierre was just the husband needed for a \nbrilliant society woman. He was that absent- \nminded crank, a grand seigneur husband who \nwas in no one's way, and far from spoiling the \nhigh tone and general impression of the draw- \ning room, he served, by the contrast he pre- \nsented to her, as an advantageous background \nto his elegant and tactful wife. Pierre during \nthe last two years, as a result of his continual \nabsorption in abstract interests and his sincere \ncontempt for all else, had acquired in his wife's \ncircle, which did not interest him, that air of \nunconcern, indifference, and benevolence to- \nward all, which cannot be acquired artificially \nand therefore inspires involuntary respect. He \nentered his wife's drawing room as one enters \na theater, was acquainted with everybody, \nequally pleased to see everyone, and equally in- \ndifferent to them all. Sometimes he joined in a \nconversation which interested him and, regard- \nless of whether any "gentlemen of the embassy" \nwere present or not, lispingly expressed his \nviews, which were sometimes not at all in ac- \ncord with the accepted tone of the moment. \nBut the general opinion concerning the queer \nhusband of "the most distinguished woman in \nPetersburg" was so well established that no \none took his freaks seriously. \n\nAmong the many young men who frequented \nher house every day, Boris Drubetsk6y, who had \nalready achieved great success in the service, \nwas the most intimate friend of the Bezukhov \nhousehold since Hlne's return from Erfurt. \nHlene spoke of him as "mon page" and \ntreated him like a child. Her smile for him was \nthe same as for everybody, but sometimes that \nsmile made Pierre uncomfortable. Toward him \nBoris behaved with a particularly dignified and \nsad deference. This shade of deference also dis- \nturbed Pierre. He had suffered so painfully \nthree years before from the mortification to \nwhich his wife had subjected him that he now \nprotected himself from the danger of its repeti- \ntion, first by not being a husband to his wife, \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nand secondly by not allowing himself to sus- \npect. \n\n"No, now that she has become a bluestock- \ning she has finally renounced her former in- \nfatuations," he told himself. "There has never \nbeen an instance of a bluestocking being car- \nried away by affairs of the heart"a statement \nwhich, though gathered from an unknown \nsource, he believed implicitly. Yet strange to \nsay Borfs' presence in his wife's drawing room \n(and he was almost always there) had a physi- \ncal effect upon Pierre; it constricted his limbs \nand destroyed the unconsciousness and free- \ndom of his movements. \n\n"What a strange antipathy," thought Pierre, \n"yet I used to like him very much." \n\nIn the eyes of the world Pierre was a great \ngentleman, the rather blind and absurd hus- \nband of a distinguished wife, a clever crank \nwho did nothing but harmed nobody and was \na first-rate, good-natured fellow. But a com- \nplex and difficult process of internal develop- \nment was taking place all this time in Pierre's \nsoul, revealing much to him and causing him \nmany spiritual doubts and joys. \n\nCHAPTER X \n\nPIERRE WENT ON with his diary, and this is what \nhe wrote in it during that time: \nNovember \n\n\n\nGot up at eight, read the Scriptures, then went \nto my duties. [By Joseph Alexevich's advice Pierre \nhad entered the service of the state and served on \none of the committees.] Returned home for dinner \nand dined alone the countess had many visitors \nI do not like. I ate and drank moderately and after \ndinner copied out some passages for the Brothers. \nIn the evening I went down to the countess and \ntold a funny story about B., and only remembered \nthat I ought not to have done so when everybody \nlaughed loudly at it. \n\nI am going to bed with a happy and tranquil \nmind. Great God, help me to walk in Thy paths, \n(i) to conquer anger by calmness and delibera- \ntion, (2) to vanquish lust by self-restraint and re- \npulsion, (3) to withdraw from worldliness, but not \navoid (a) the service of the state, (b) family du- \nties, (c) relations with my friends, and (d) the \nmanagement of my affairs. \n\n2jth November \n\nI got up late. On waking I lay long in bed yield- \ning to sloth. O God, help and strengthen me that I \nmay walk in Thy ways! Read the Scriptures, but \nwithout proper feeling. Brother Uriisov came and \nwe talked about worldly vanities. He told me of \nthe Emperor's new projects. I began to criticize \nthem, but remembered my rules and my benefac- \ntor's wordsthat a true Freemason should be a \n\n\n\nzealous worker for the state when his aid is re- \nquired and a quiet onlooker when not called on \nto assist. My tongue is my enemy. Brothers G. V. \nand O. visited me and we had a preliminary talk \nabout the reception of a new Brother. They laid \non me the duty of Rhetor. I feel myself weak and \nunworthy. Then our talk turned to the interpre- \ntation of the seven pillars and steps of the Tem- \nple, the seven sciences, the seven virtues, the seven \nvices, and the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit. \nBrother O. was very eloquent. In the evening the \nadmission took place. The new decoration of the \npremises contributed much to the magnificence of \nthe spectacle. It was Borfs Drubetskoy who was ad- \nmitted. I nominated him and was the Rhetor. A \nstrange feeling agitated me all the time I was \nalone with him in the dark chamber. I caught my- \nself harboring a feeling of hatred toward him \nwhich I vainly tried to overcome. That is why I \nshould really like to save him from evil and lead \nhim into the path of truth, but evil thoughts of \nhim did not leave me. It seemed to me that his ob- \nject in entering the Brotherhood was merely to be \nintimate and in favor with members of our lodge. \nApart from the fact that he had asked me several \ntimes whether N. and S. were members of our \nlodge (a question to which I could not reply) and \nthat according to my observation he is incapable \nof feeling respect for our holy order and is too pre- \noccupied and satisfied with the outer man to de- \nsire spiritual improvement, I had no cause to \ndoubt him, but he seemed to me insincere, and all \nthe time I stood alone with him in the dark tem- \nple it seemed to me that he was smiling con- \ntemptuously at my words, and I wished really to \nstab his bare breast with the sword I held to it. I \ncould not be eloquent, nor could I frankly men- \ntion my doubts to the Brothers and to the Grand \nMaster. Great Architect of Nature, help me to find \nthe true path out of the labyrinth of lies! \n\nAfter this, three pages were left blank in the \ndiary, and then the following was written: \n\nI have had a long and instructive talk alone with \nBrother V.,who advised me to hold fast by Brother \nA. Though I am unworthy, much was revealed to \nme. Adonai is the name of the creator of the world. \nElohim is the name of the ruler of all. The third \nname is the name unutterable which means the \nAll. Talks with Brother V. strengthen, refresh, and \nsupport me in the path of virtue. In his presence \ndoubt has no place. The distinction between the \npoor teachings of mundane science and our sa- \ncred all-embracing teaching is clear to me. Human \nsciences dissect everything to comprehend it, and \nkill everything to examine it. In the holy science \nof our order all is one, all is known in its entirety \nand life. The Trinity-the three elements of mat- \nterare sulphur, mercury, and salt. Sulphur is of \nan oily and fiery nature; in combination with salt \nby its fiery nature it arouses a desire in the latter \nby means of which it attracts mercury, seizes it, \n\n\n\nBOOK SIX \n\n\n\nholds it, and in combination produces other bod- \nies. Mercury is a fluid, volatile, spiritual essence. \nChrist, the Holy Spirit, HimI . . . \n\n3rd December \n\nAwoke late, read the Scriptures but was apa- \nthetic. Afterwards went and paced up and down \nthe large hall. I wished to meditate, but instead \nmy imagination pictured an occurrence of four \nyears ago, when D61okhov, meeting me in Moscow \nafter our duel, said he hoped I was enjoying per- \nfect peace of mind in spite of my wife's absence. \nAt the time I gave him no answer. Now I recalled \nevery detail of that meeting and in my mind gave \nhim the most malevolent and bitter replies. I rec- \nollected myself and drove away that thought only \nwhen I found myself glowing with anger, but I did \nnot sufficiently repent. Afterwards Boris Drubet- \nsk6y came and began relating various adventures. \nHis coming vexed me from the first, and I said \nsomething disagreeable to him. He replied. I flared \nup and said much that was unpleasant and even \nrude to him. He became silent, and I recollected \nmyself only when it was too late. My God, I can- \nnot get on with him at all. The cause of this is my \negotism. I set myself above him and so become \nmuch worse than he, for he is lenient to my rude- \nness while I on the contrary nourish contempt for \nhim. O God, grant that in his presence I may \nrather see my own vileness, and behave so that he \ntoo may benefit. After dinner I fell asleep and as \nI was drowsing off I clearly heard a voice saying in \nmy left ear, "Thy day!" \n\nI dreamed that I was walking in the dark and \nwas suddenly surrounded by dogs, but I went on \nundismayed. Suddenly a smallish dog seized my \nleft thigh with its teeth and would not let go. I \nbegan to throttle it with my hands. Scarcely had I \ntorn it off before another, a bigger one, began bit- \ning me. I lifted it up, but the higher I lifted it the \nbigger and heavier it grew. And suddenly Brother \nA. came and, taking my arm, led me to a building \nto enter which we had to pass along a narrow \nplank. I stepped on it, but it bent and gave way \nand I began to clamber up a fence which I could \nscarcely reach with my hands. After much effort I \ndragged myself up, so that my legs hung down on \none side and my body on the other. I looked round \nand saw Brother A. standing on the fence and \npointing me to a broad avenue and garden, and in \nthe garden was a large and beautiful building. I \nwoke up. O Lord, great Architect of Nature, help \nme to tear from myself these dogs my passions \nespecially the last, which unites in itself the \nstrength of all the former ones, and aid me to \nenter that temple of virtue to a vision of which I \nattained in my dream. \n\n7th December \n\nI dreamed that Joseph Alexevich was sitting in \nmy house, and that I was very glad and wished to \nentertain him. It seemed as if I chattered inces- \n\n\n\nsantly with other people and suddenly remem- \nbered that this could not please him, and I wished \nto come close to him and embrace him. But as \nsoon as I drew near I saw that his face had changed \nand grown young, and he was quietly telling me \nsomething about the teaching of our order, but \nso softly that I could not hear it. Then it seemed \nthat we all left the room and something strange \nhappened. We were sitting or lying on the floor. \nHe was telling me something, and I wished to \nshow him my sensibility, and not listening to \nwhat he was saying I began picturing to myself the \ncondition of my inner man and the grace of God \nsanctifying me. And tears came into my eyes, and \nI was glad he noticed this. But he looked at me \nwith vexation and jumped up, breaking off his re- \nmarks. I felt abashed and asked whether what he \nhad been saying did not concern me; but he did \nnot reply, gave me a kind look, and then we sud- \ndenly found ourselves in my bedroom where there \nis a double bed. He lay down on the edge of it and \nI burned with longing to caress him and lie down \ntoo. And he said, "Tell me frankly what is your \nchief temptation? Do you know it? I think you \nknow it already." Abashed by this question, I re- \nplied that sloth was my chief temptation. He \nshook his head incredulously; and even more \nabashed, I said that though I was living with my \nwife as he advised, I was not living with her as her \nhusband. To this he replied that one should not \ndeprive a wife of one's embraces and gave me to \nunderstand that that was my duty. But I replied \nthat I should be ashamed to do it, and suddenly \neverything vanished. And I awoke and found in \nmy mind the text from the Gospel: "The life was \nthe light of men. And the light shineth in dark- \nness; and the darkness comprehended it not." \nJoseph Alexevich's face had looked young and \nbright. That day I received a letter from my bene- \nfactor in which he wrote about "conjugal duties." \n\n9th December \n\nI had a dream from which I awoke with a throb- \nbing heart. I saw that I was in Moscow in my house, \nin the big sitting room, and Joseph Alexevich \ncame in from the drawing room. I seemed to know \nat once that the process of regeneration had al- \nready taken place in him, and I rushed to meet \nhim. I embraced him and kissed his hands, and \nhe said, "Hast thou noticed that my face is dif- \nferent?" I looked at him, still holding him in my \narms, and saw that his face was young, but that \nhe had no hair on his head and his features were \nquite changed. And I said, "I should have known \nyou had I met you by chance," and I thought to \nmyself, "Am I telling the truth?" And suddenly I \nsaw him lying like a dead body; then he gradually \nrecovered and went with me into my study carry- \ning a large book of sheets of drawing paper; I \nsaid, "I drew that," and he answered by bowing \nhis head. I opened the book, and on all the pages \nthere were excellent drawings. And in my dream \n\n\n\n250 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nI knew that these drawings represented the love \nadventures of the soul with its beloved. And on its \npages I saw a beautiful representation of a maiden \nin transparent garments and with a transparent \nbody, flying up to the clouds. And I seemed to \nknow that this maiden was nothing else than a \nrepresentation of the Song of Songs. And looking \nat those drawings I dreamed I felt that I was do- \ning wrong, but could not tear myself away from \nthem. Lord, help mel My God, if Thy forsaking \nme is Thy doing, Thy will be done; but if I am \nmyself the cause, teach me what I should do! I \nshall perish of my debauchery if Thou utterly de- \nsertest me! \n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI \n\nTHE Rosx6vs' MONETARY AFFAIRS had not im- \nproved during the two years they had spent in \nthe country. \n\nThough Nicholas Rostov had kept firmly to \nhis resolution and was still serving modestly in \nan obscure regiment, spending comparatively \nlittle, the way of life at Otradnoe Mftenka's \nmanagement of affairs, in particular was such \nthat the debts inevitably increased every year. \nThe only resource obviously presenting itself \nto the old count was to apply for an official \npost, so he had come to Petersburg to look for \none and also, as he said, to let the lassies enjoy \nthemselves for the last time. \n\nSoon after their arrival in Petersburg Berg \nproposed to Ve*ra and was accepted. \n\nThough in Moscow the Rostovs belonged to \nthe best society without themselves giving it a \nthought, yet in Petersburg their circle of ac- \nquaintances was a mixed and indefinite one. \nIn Petersburg they were provincials, and the \nvery people they had entertained in Moscow \nwithout inquiring to what set they belonged, \nhere looked down on them. \n\nThe Rost6vs lived in the same hospitable \nway in Petersburg as in Moscow, and the most \ndiverse people met at their suppers. Country \nneighbors from Otradnoe, impoverished old \nsquires and their daughters, Per6nskaya a maid \nof honor, Pierre Beziikhov, arid the son of their \ndistrict postmaster who had obtained a post in \nPetersburg. Among the men who very soon be- \ncame frequent visitors at the Rost6vs' house in \nPetersburg were Boris, Pierre whom the count \nhad met in the street and dragged home with \nhim, and Berg who spent whole days at the \nRost6vs' and paid the eldest daughter, Count- \ness Ve'ra, the attentions a young man pays when \nhe intends to propose. \n\nNot in vain had Berg shown everybody his \nright hand wounded at Austerlitz and held a \n\n\n\nperfectly unnecessary sword in his left. He nar \nrated that episode so persistently and with st\ \nimportant an air that everyone believed in the \nmerit and usefulness of his deed, and he had \nobtained two decorations for Austerlitz. \n\nIn the Finnish war he also managed to dis- \ntinguish himself. He had picked up the scrap \nof a grenade that had killed an aide-de-camp \nstanding near the commander in chief and had \ntaken it to his commander. Just as he had done \nafter Austerlitz, he related this occurrence at \nsuch length and so insistently that everyone \nagain believed it had been necessary to do this, \nand he received two decorations for the Fin- \nnish war also. In 1809 he was a captain in the \nGuards, wore medals, and held some special \nlucrative posts in Petersburg. \n\nThough some skeptics smiled when told of \nBerg's merits, it could not be denied that he \nwas a painstaking and brave officer, on excel- \nlent terms with his superiors, and a moral \nyoung man with a brilliant career before him \nand an assured position in society. \n\nFour years before, meeting a German com- \nrade in the stalls of a Moscow theater, Berg \nhad pointed out Ve'ra Rost6va to him and had \nsaid in German, "das soil mein Weib werden," 1 \nand from that moment had made up his mind \nto marry her. Now in Petersburg, having con- \nsidered the Rost6vs' position and his own, he \ndecided that the time had come to propose. \n\nBerg's proposal was at first received with a \nperplexity that was not flattering to him. At \nfirst it seemed strange that the son of an ob- \nscure Livonian gentleman should propose mar- \nriage to a Countess Rost6va; but Berg's chief \ncharacteristic was such a naive and goocl- \nnatured egotism that the Rost6vs involuntarily \ncame to think it would be a good thing, since \nhe himself was so firmly convinced that it was \ngood, indeed excellent. Moreover, the Rostovs' \naffairs were seriously embarrassed, as the suitor \ncould not but know; and above all, Ve'ra was \ntwenty-four, had been taken out everywhere, \nand though she was certainly good-looking and \nsensible, no one up to now had proposed to \nher. So they gave their consent. \n\n"You see," said Berg to his comrade, whom \nhe called "friend" only because he knew that \neveryone has friends, "you see, I have consid- \nered it all, and should not marry if I had not \nthought it all out or if it were in any way un- \nsuitable. But on the contrary, my papa and \nmamma are now provided for I have arranged \nthat rent for them in the Baltic Provincesand \n\n1 "That girl shall be my wife." \n\n\n\nI can live in Petersburg on my pay, and with \nher fortune and my good management we can \nget along nicely. I am not marrying for money \nI consider that dishonorablebut a wife \nshould bring her share and a husband his. I \nhave my position in the service, she has con- \nnections and some means. In our times that is \nworth something, isn't it? But above all, she is \na handsome, estimable girl, and she loves \nme. . . ." \n\nBerg blushed and smiled. \n\n"And I love her, because her character is \nsensible and very good. Now the other sister, \nthough they are the same family, is quite dif- \nferentan unpleasant character and has not \nthe same intelligence. She is so ... you know? \n. . . Unpleasant . . . But my fiancee! . . . Well, \nyou will be coming," he was going to say, "to \ndine," but changed his mind and said, "to take \ntea with us," and quickly doubling up his \ntongue he blew a small round ring of tobacco \nsmoke, perfectly embodying his dream of hap- \npiness. \n\nAfter the first feeling of perplexity aroused \nin the parents by Berg's proposal, the holiday \ntone of joyousness usual at such times took pos- \nsession of the family, but the rejoicing was ex- \nternal and insincere. In the family's feeling to- \nward this wedding a certain awkwardness and \nconstraint was evident, as if they were ashamed \nof not having loved Ve*ra sufficiently and of be- \ning so ready to get her off their hands. The old \ncount felt this most. He would probably have \nbeen unable to state the cause of his embarrass- \nment, but it resulted from the state of his af- \nfairs. He did not know at all how much he had, \nwhat his debts amounted to, or what dowry he \ncould give V6ra. When his daughters were \nborn he had assigned to each of them, for her \ndowry, an estate with three hundred serfs; but \none of these estates had already been sold, and \nthe other was mortgaged and the interest so \nmuch in arrears that it would have to be sold, \nso that it was impossible to give it to Vera. Nor \nhad he any money. \n\nBerg had already been engaged a month, \nand only a week remained before the wedding, \nbut the count had not yet decided in his own \nmind the question of the dowry, nor spoken to \nhiswifeabout it. Atone time the count thought \nof giving her the Ryazan estate or of selling a \nforest, at another time of borrowing money on \na note of hand. A few days before the wedding \nBerg entered the count's study early one morn- \ning and, with a pleasant smile, respectfully \nasked his future father-in-law to let him know \n\n\n\nBOOK SIX 251 \n\nwhat Wra's dowry would be. The count was so \n\n\n\ndisconcerted by this long-foreseen inquiry that \nwithout consideration he gave the first reply \nthat came into his head. "I like your being busi- \nnesslike about it. ... I like it. You shall be \nsatisfied. . . ." \n\nAnd patting Berg on the shoulder he got up, \nwishing to end the conversation. But Berg, \nsmiling pleasantly, explained that if he did not \nknow for certain how much Vra would have \nand did not receive at least part of the dowry in \nadvance, he would have to break matters off. \n\n"Because, consider, Count if I allowed my- \nself to marry now without having definite \nmeans to maintain my wife, I should be acting \nbadly " \n\nThe conversation ended by the count, who \nwished to be generous and to avoid further im- \nportunity, saying that he would give a note of \nhand for eighty thousand rubles. Berg smiled \nmeekly, kissed the count on the shoulder, and \nsaid that he was very grateful, but that it was \nimpossible for him to arrange his new life with- \nout receiving thirty thousand in ready money. \n"Or at least twenty thousand, Count," he added, \n"and then a note of hand for only sixty thou- \nsand." \n\n"Yes, yes, all rightl" said the count hurried- \nly. "Only excuse me, my dear fellow, I'll give \nyou twenty thousand and a note of hand for \neighty thousand as well. Yes, yes! Kiss me." \n\nCHAPTER XII \n\nNATASHA WAS SIXTEEN and it was the year 1809, \nthe very year to which she had counted on her \nfingers with Boris after they had kissed four \nyears ago. Since then she had not seen him. Be- \nfore S6nya and her mother, if Boris happened \nto be mentioned, she spoke quite freely of that \nepisode as of some childish, long-forgotten mat- \nter that was not worth mentioning. But in the \nsecret depths of her soul the question whether \nher engagement to Boris was a jest or an im- \nportant, binding promise tormented her. \n\nSince Boris left Moscow in 1805 to join the \narmy he had not seen the Rostovs. He had been \nin Moscow several times, and had passed near \nOtradnoe, but had never been to see them. \n\nSometimes it occurred to Natdsha that he did \nnot wish to see her, and this conjecture was \nconfirmed by the sad tone in which her elders \nspoke of him. \n\n"Nowadays old friends are not remembered," \nthe countess would say when Borfs was men- \ntioned. \n\nAnna Mikhaylovna also had of late visited \n\n\n\n252 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nthem less frequently, seemed to hold herself \nwith particular dignity, and always spoke rap- \nturously and gratefully of the merits of her son \nand the brilliant career on which he had en- \ntered. When the Rost6vs came to Petersburg \nBoris called on them. \n\nHe drove to their house in some agitation. \nThe memory of Natasha was his most poetic \nrecollection. But he went with the firm inten- \ntion of letting her and her parents feel that the \nchildish relations between himself and Natasha \ncould not be binding either on her or on him. \nHe had a brilliant position in society thanks to \nhis intimacy with Countess Bezukhova, a bril- \nliant position in the service thanks to the pat- \nronage of an important personage whose com- \nplete confidence he enjoyed, and he was begin- \nning to make plans for marrying one of the \nrichest heiresses in Petersburg, plans which \nmight very easily be realized. When he entered \nthe Rost6vs' drawing room Natdsha was in her \nown room. When she heard of his arrival she \nalmost ran into the drawing room, flushed and \nbeaming with a more than cordial smile. \n\nBoris remembered Natasha in a short dress, \nwith dark eyes shining from under her curls \nand boisterous, childish laughter, as he had \nknown her four years before; and so he was tak- \nen aback when quite a different Natasha en- \ntered, and his face expressed rapturous aston- \nishment. This expression on his face pleased \nNatasha. \n\n"Well, do you recognize your little madcap \nplaymate?" asked the countess. \n\nBoris kissed Natdsha's hand and said that he \nwas astonished at the change in her. \n\n"How handsome you have grown!" \n\n"I should think sol replied Natdsha's laugh- \ning eyes. \n\n"And is Papa older?" she asked. \n\nNatdsha sat down and, without joining in \nBoris* conversation with the countess, silently \nand minutely studied her childhood's suitor. \nHe felt the weight of that resolute and affec- \ntionate scrutiny and glanced at her occasional- \nly. \n\nBoris* uniform, spurs, tie, and the way his \nhair was brushed were all comme il faut and in \nthe latest fashion. This Natdsha noticed at \nonce. He sat rather sideways in the armchair \nnext to the countess, arranging with his right \nhand the cleanest of gloves that fitted his left \nhand like a skin, and he spoke with a particu- \nlarly refined compression of his lips about the \namusements of the highest Petersburg society, \nrecalling with mild irony old times in Mos- \n\n\n\ncow and Moscow acquaintances. It was not \naccidentally, Natasha felt, that he alluded, \nwhen speaking of the highest aristocracy, to an \nambassador's ball he had attended, and to in- \nvitations he had received from N.N. and S.S. \n\nAll this time Natdsha sat silent, glancing up \nat him from under her brows. This gaze dis- \nturbed and confused Boris more and more. He \nlooked round more frequently toward her, and \nbroke off in what he was saying. He did not \nstay more than ten minutes, then rose and took \nhis leave. The same inquisitive, challenging, \nand rather mocking eyes still looked at him. \nAfter his first visit Boris said to himself that Na- \ntdsha attracted him just as much as ever, but \nthat he must not yield to that feeling, because \nto marry her, a girl almost without fortune, \nwould mean ruin to his career, while to renew \ntheir former relations without intending to \nmarry her would be dishonorable. Boris made \nup his mind to avoid meeting Natdsha, but de- \nspite that resolution he called again a few days \nlater and began calling often and spending \nwhole days at the Rost6vs'. It seemed to him \nthat he ought to have an explanation with Na- \ntdsha and tell her that the old times must be \nforgotten, that in spite of everything . . . she \ncould not be his wife, that he had no means, \nand they would never let hermarryhim. But he \nfailed to do so and felt awkward about enter- \ning on such an explanation. From day to day \nhe became more and more entangled. It seemed \nto her mother and S6nya that Natdsha was in \nlove with Boris as of old. She sang him his fa- \nvorite songs, showed him her album, making \nhim write in it, did not allow him to allude to \nthe past, letting it be understood how delight- \nful was the present; and every day he went away \nin a fog, without having said what he meant to, \nand not knowing what he was doing or why he \ncame, or how it would alf end. He left off visit- \ning Hdlene and received reproachful notes \nfrom her every day, and yet he continued to \nspend whole days with the Rost6vs. \n\nCHAPTER XIII \n\nONE NIGHT when the old countess, in nightcap \nand dressing jacket, without her false curls, \nand with her poor little knob of hair showing \nunder her white cotton cap, knelt sighing and \ngroaning on a rug and bowing to the ground \nin prayer, her door creaked and Natdsha, also \nin a dressing jacket with slippers on her bare \nfeet and her hair in curlpapers, ran in. The \ncountess her prayerful mood dispelled \nlooked round and frowned. She was finishing \n\n\n\nher last prayer: "Can it be that this couch will \nbe my grave?" Natasha, flushed and eager, \nseeing her mother in prayer, suddenly checked \nher rush, half sat down, and unconsciously put \nout her tongue as if chiding herself. Seeing that \nher mother was still praying she ran on tiptoe \nto the bed and, rapidly slipping one little foot \nagainst the other, pushed off her slippers and \njumped onto the bed the countess had feared \nmight become her grave. This couch was high, \nwith a feather bed and five pillows each small- \ner than the one below. Natasha jumped on it, \nsank into the feather bed, rolled over to the \nwall, and began snuggling up the bedclothes \nas she settled down, raising her knees to her \nchin, kicking out and laughing almost inaudi- \nbly, now covering herself up head and all, and \nnow peeping at her mother. The countess \nfinished her prayers and came to the bed \nwith a stern face, but seeing that Natasha's \nhead was covered, she smiled in her kind, \nweak way. \n\n"Now then, now then!" said she. \n\n"Mamma, can we have a talk? Yes?" said Na- \ntasha. "Now, just one on your throat and an- \nother . . . that'll do!" And seizing her mother \nround the neck, she kissed her on the throat. \nIn her behavior to her mother Natasha seemed \nrough, but she was so sensitive and tactful that \nhowever she clasped her mother she always \nmanaged to do it without hurting her or mak- \ning her feel uncomfortable or displeased. \n\n"Well, what is it tonight?" said the mother, \nhaving arranged her pillows and waited until \nNatdsha, after turning over a couple of times, \nhad settled down beside her under the quilt, \nspread out her arms, and assumed a serious ex- \npression. \n\nThese visits of Natasha's at night before the \ncount returned from his club were one of the \ngreatest pleasures of both mother and daugh- \nter. \n\n"What is it tonight? But I have to tell \nyou ..." \n\nNatdsha put her hand on her mother's mouth. \n\n"About Boris ... I know," she said seriously; \n"that's what I have come about. Don't say it \nI know. No, do tell me!" and she removed her \nhand. "Tell me, Mamma! He's nice?" \n\n"Natasha, you are sixteen. At your age I was \nmarried. You say Boris is nice. He is very nice, \nand I love him like a son. But what then? . . . \nWhat are you thinking about? You have quite \nturned his head, I can see that. . . ." \n\nAs she said this the countess looked round \nat her daughter. Natdsha was lying looking \n\n\n\nBOOK SIX 253 \n\nsteadily straight before her at one of the ma- \n\n\n\nhogany sphinxes carved on the corners of the \nbedstead, so that the countess only saw her \ndaughter's face in profile. That face struck her \nby its peculiarly serious and concentrated ex- \npression. \n\nNatdsha was listening and considering. \n\n"Well, what then?" said she. \n\n"You have quite turned his head, and why? \nWhat do you want of him? You know you can't \nmarry him." \n\n"Why not?" said Natdsha, without changing \nher position. \n\n"Because he is young, because he is poor, be- \ncause he is a relation . . . and because you your- \nself don't love him." \n\n"How do you know?" \n\n"I know. It is not right, darling!" \n\n"But if I want to . . ," said Natdsha. \n\n"Leave off talking nonsense," said the count- \ness. \n\n"But if I want to . . ." \n\n"Natdsha, I am in earnest . . ." \n\nNatdsha did not let her finish. She drew the \ncountess' large hand to her, kissed it on the \nback and then on the palm, then again turned \nit over and began kissing first one knuckle, \nthen the space between the knuckles, then the \nnext knuckle, whispering, "January, February, \nMarch, April, May. Speak, Mamma, why don't \nyou say anything? Speak!" said she, turning to \nher mother, who was tenderly gazing at her \ndaughter and in that contemplation seemed to \nhave forgotten all she had witffc&amp;to say. \n\n"It won't do, my love! Not everyone will un- \nderstand this friendship dating from your \nchildish days, and to see him so intimate with \nyou may injure you in the eyes of other young \nmen who visit us, and above all it torments \nhim for nothing. He may already have found a \nsuitable and wealthy match, and now he's half \ncrazy." \n\n"Crazy?" repeated Natdsha. \n\n"I'll tell you some things about myself. I had \na cousin . . ." \n\n"I know! Cyril Matvdich . . . but he is old." \n\n"He was not always old. But this is what I'll \ndo, Natdsha, I'll have a talk with Boris. He \nneed not come so often, ..." \n\n"Why not, if he likes to?" \n\n"Because I know it will end in nothing. . , ." \n\n"How can you know? No, Mamma, don't \nspeak to him! What nonsense!" said Natdsha \nin the tone of one being deprived of her prop- \nerty. "Well, I won't marry, but let him come if \nhe enjoys it and I enjoy it." Natdsha smiled \n\n\n\n254 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nand looked at her mother. "Not to marry, but \njust so," she added. \n\n"How 50, my pet?" \n\n"Just so. There's no need for me to marry \nhim. But . . . just 50." \n\n"Just so, just so," repeated the countess, and \nshaking all over, she went off into a good- \nhumored, unexpected, elderly laugh. \n\n"Don't laugh, stop!" cried Natasha. "You're \nshaking the whole bedl You're awfully likeme, \njust such another giggler. . . . Wait . . ." and \nshe seized the countess' hands and kissed a \nknuckle of the little finger, saying, "June," and \ncontinued, kissing, "July, August," on the oth- \ner hand. "But, Mamma, is he very much in \nlove? What do you think? Was anybody ever \nso much in love with you? And he's very nice, \nvery, very nice. Only not quite my taste he is \nso narrow, like the dining-room clock. . . . Don't \nyou understand? Narrow, you know gray, light \ngray..." \n\n"What rubbish you're talking!" said the \ncountess. \n\nNatasha continued: "Don't you really un- \nderstand? Nicholas would understand. . . . Be- \nzukhov, now, is blue, dark-blue and red, and \nhe is square." \n\n"You flirt with him too," said the countess, \nlaughing. \n\n"No, he is a Freemason, I have found out. \nHe is fine, dark-blue and red. . . . How can I \nexplain it to you?" \n\n"Little countess!" the count's voice called \nfrom behind the door. "You're not asleep?" \nNatdsha jumped up, snatched up her slippers, \nand ran barefoot to her own room. \n\nIt was a long time before she could sleep. \nShe kept thinking that no one could under- \nstand all that she understood and all there was \nin her. \n\n"S6nya?" she thought, glancing at that curled- \nup, sleeping little kitten with her enormous \nplait of hair. "No, how could she? She's virtu- \nous. She fell in love with Nicholas and does \nnot wish to know anything more. Even Mam- \nma does not understand. It is wonderful how \nclever I am and how . . . charming she is," she \nwent on, speaking of herself in the third per- \nson, and imagining it was some very wise man \nthe wisest and best of men who was saying \nit of her. "There is everything, everything in \nher," continued this man. "She is unusually in- \ntelligent, charming . . . and then she is pretty, \nuncommonly pretty, and agile she swims and \nrides splendidly . . . and her voice! One can \nreally say it's a wonderful voice 1" \n\n\n\nShe hummed a scrap from her favorite opera \nby Cherubini, threw herself on her bed, laughed \nat the pleasant thought that she would imme- \ndiately fall asleep, called Dunydsha the maid \nto put out the candle, and before Dunydsha \nhad left the room had already passed into yet \nanother happier world of dreams, where every- \nthing was as light and beautiful as in reality, \nand even more so because it was different. \n\nNext day the countess called Boris aside and \nhad a talk with him, after which he ceased com- \ning to the Rost6vs*. \n\nCHAPTER XIV \n\nON THE THIRTY-FIRST OF DECEMBER, New Year's \n\nEve, 1809-10, an old grandee of Catherine's \nday was giving a ball and midnight supper. \nThe diplomatic corps and the Emperor himself \nwere to be present. \n\nThe grandee's well-known mansion on the \nEnglish Quay glittered with innumerable lights. \nPolice were stationed at the brightly lit en- \ntrance which was carpeted with red baize, and \nnot only gendarmes but dozens of police of- \nficers and even the police master himself stood \nat the porch. Carriages kept driving away and \nfresh ones arriving, with red-liveried footmen \nand footmen in plumed hats. From the car- \nriages emerged men wearing uniforms, stars, \nand ribbons, while ladies in satin and ermine \ncautiously descended the carriage steps which \nwere let down for them with a clatter, and then \nwalked hurriedly and noiselessly over the baize \nat the entrance. \n\nAlmost every time a new carriage drove up a \nwhisper ran through the crowd and caps were \ndoffed. \n\n"The Emperor? . . . No, a minister . . . prince \n. . . ambassador. Don't you see the plumes? . . ." \nwas whispered among the crowd. \n\nOne person, better dressed than the rest, \nseemed to know everyone and mentioned by \nname the greatest dignitaries of the day. \n\nA third of the visitors had already arrived, \nbut the Rost6vs, who were to be present, were \nstill hurrying to get dressed. \n\nThere had been many discussions and prepa- \nrations for this ball in the Rost6v family, many \nfears that the invitation would not arrive, that \nthe dresses would not be ready, or that some- \nthing would not be arranged as it should be. \n\nMdrya Igndtevna Per6nskaya, a thin and \nshallow maid of honor at the court of the Dow- \nager Empress, who was a friend and relation of \nthe countess and piloted the provincial Rost6vs \n\n\n\nBOOK SIX \n\n\n\nin Petersburg high society, was to accompany \nthem to the ball. \n\nThey were to call for her at her house in the \nTaurida Gardens at ten o'clock, but it was al- \nready five minutes to ten, and the girls were \nnot yet dressed. \n\nNatasha was going to her first grand ball. She \nhad got up at eight that morning and had been \nin a fever of excitement and activity all day. \nAll her powers since morning had been con- \ncentrated on ensuring that they all she her- \nself, Mamma, and S6nya should be as well \ndressed as possible. S6nya and her mother put \nthemselves entirely in her hands. The countess \nwas to wear a claret-colored velvet dress, and \nthe two girls white gauze over pink silk slips, \nwith roses on their bodices and their hair \ndressed &amp; In grecque. \n\nEverything essential had already been done; \nfeet, hands, necks, and ears washed, perfumed, \nand powdered, as befits a ball; the openwork \nsilk stockings and white satin shoes with rib- \nbons were already on; the hairdressing was al- \nmost done. S6nya was finishing dressing and so \nwas the countess, but Natasha, who had bustled \nabout helping them all, was behindhand. She \nwas still sitting before a looking-glass with a \ndressing jacket thrown over her slender shoul- \nders. S6nya stood ready dressed in the middle \nof the room and, pressing the head of a pin till \nit hurt her dainty finger, was fixingon a lastrib- \nbon that squeaked as the pin went through it. \n\n"That's not the way, that's not the way, \nS6nya!" cried Natdsha turning her head and \nclutching with both hands at her hair which \nthe maid who was dressing it had not time to \nrelease. "That bow is not right. Come here!" \n\nS6nya sat down and Natdsha pinned the rib- \nbon on differently. \n\n"Allow me, Missl I can't do it like that," said \nthe maid who was holding Natasha's hair. \n\n"Oh, dearl Well then, wait. That's right, \nS6nya." \n\n"Aren't you ready? It is nearly ten," came \nthe countess' voice. \n\n"Directly! Directly! And you, Mamma?" \n\n"I have only my cap to pin on." \n\n"Don't do it without me!" called Natdsha. \n"You won't do it right." \n\n"But it's already ten." \n\nThey had decided to be at the ball by half- \npast ten, and Natdsha had still to get dressed \nand they had to call at the Taurida Gardens. \n\nWhen her hair was done, Natasha, in her \nshort petticoat from under which her dancing \nshoes showed, and in her mother's dressing \n\n\n\njacket, ran up to S6nya, scrutinized her, and \nthen ran to her mother. Turning her mother's \nhead this way and that, she fastened on the cap \nand, hurriedly kissing her gray hair, ran back \nto the maids who were turning up the hem of \nher skirt. \n\nThe cause of the delay was Natasha's skirt, \nwhich was too long. Two maids were turning \nup the hem and hurriedly biting off the ends \nof thread. A third with pins in her mouth was \nrunning about between the countess and S6n- \nya, and a fourth held the whole of the gossa- \nmer garment up high on one uplifted hand. \n\n"Mdvra, quicker, darling!" \n\n"Give me my thimble, Miss, from there . . ." \n\n"Whenever will you be ready?" asked the \ncount coming to the door. "Here is some scent. \nPer6nskaya must be tired of waiting." \n\n"It's ready, Miss," said the maid, holding up \nthe shortened gauze dress with two fingers, and \nblowing arid shaking something off it, as if by \nthis to express a consciousness of the airiness \nand purity of what she held. \n\nNatdsha began putting on the dress. \n\n"In a minute! In a minute! Don't come in, \nPapa!" she cried to her father as he opened the \ndoor speaking from under the filmy skirt which \nstill covered her whole face. \n\nSonya slammed the door to. A minute later \nthey let the count in. He was wearing a blue \nswallow-tail coat, shoes and stockings, and was \nperfumed and his hair pomaded. \n\n"Oh, Papal how nice you look! Charming!" \ncried Natasha, as she stood in the middle of the \nroom smoothing out the folds of the gauze. \n\n"If you please, Miss! allow me," said the \nmaid, who on her knees was pulling the skirt \nstraight and shifting the pins from one side of \nher mouth to the other with her tongue. \n\n"Say what you like," exclaimed S6nya, in a \ndespairing voice as she looked at Natdsha, "say \nwhat you like, it's still too long." \n\nNatdsha stepped back to look at herself in \nthe pier glass. The dress was too long. \n\n"Really, madam, it is not at all too long," \nsaid Mdvra, crawling on her knees after her \nyoung lady. \n\n"Well, if it's too long we'll take it up ... \nwe'll tack it up in one minute," said the reso- \nlute Dunydsha taking a needle that was stuck \non the front of her little shawl and, still kneel- \ning on the floor, set to work once more. \n\nAt that moment, with soft steps, the count- \ness came in shyly, in her cap and velvet gown. \n\n"Oo-oo, my beauty!" exclaimed the count, \n"she looks better than any of you!" \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nHe would have embraced her but, blushing, \nshe stepped aside fearing to be rumpled. \n\n"Mamma, your cap, more to this side," said \nNatdsha. "I'll arrange it," and she rushed for- \nward so that the maids who were tacking up \nher skirt could not move fast enough and a \npiece of gauze was torn off. \n\n"Oh goodness! What has happened? Really \nit was not my fault I " \n\n"Never mind, I'll run it up, it won't show," \nsaid Dunydsha. \n\n"What a beauty a very queen!" said the \nnurse as she came to the door. "And S6nya! \nThey are lovely I" \n\nAt a quarter past ten they at last got into \ntheir carriages and started. But they had still \nto call at the Taurida Gardens. \n\nPer6nskaya was quite ready. In spite of her \nage and plainness she had gone through the \nsame process as the Rost6vs, but with less flur- \nryfor to her it was a matter of routine. Her \nugly old body was washed, perfumed, and pow- \ndered in just the same way. She had washed be- \nhind her ears just as carefully, and when she \nentered her drawing room in her yellow dress, \nwearing her badge as maid of honor, her old \nlady's maid was as full of rapturous admira- \ntion as the Rost6vs' servants had been. \n\nShe praised the Rost6vs' toilets. They praised \nher taste and toilet, and at eleven o'clock, care- \nful of their coiffures and dresses, they settled \nthemselves in their carriages and drove off. \n\nCHAPTER XV \n\nNATASHA had not had a moment free since \nearly morning and had not once had time to \nthink of what lay before her. \n\nIn the damp chill air and crowded closeness \nof the swaying carriage, she for the first time \nvividly imagined what was in store for her \nthere at the ball, in those brightly lighted rooms \nwith music, flowers, dances, the Emperor, \nand all the brilliant young people of Peters- \nburg. The prospect was so splendid that she \nhardly believed it would come true, so out of \nkeeping was it with the chill darkness and \ncloseness of the carriage. She understood all \nthat awaited her only when, after stepping \nover the red baize at the entrance, she entered \nthe hall, took off her fur cloak, and, beside \nS6nya and in front of her mother, mounted \nthe brightly illuminated stairs between the \nflowers. Only then did she remember how she \nmust behave at a ball, and tried to assume the \nmajestic air she considered indispensable for \na girl on such an occasion. But, fortunately for \n\n\n\nher, she felt her eyes growing misty, she saw \nnothing clearly, her pulse beat a hundred to \nthe minute, and the blood throbbed at her \nheart. She could not assume that pose, which \nwould have made her ridiculous, and she moved \non almost fainting from excitement and try- \ning with all her might to conceal it. And this \nwas the very attitude that became her best. Be- \nfore and behind them other visitors were en- \ntering, also talking in low tones and wearing \nball dresses. The mirrors on the landing re- \nflected ladies in white, pale-blue, and pink \ndresses, with diamonds and pearls on their bare \nnecks and arms. \n\nNatasha looked in the mirrors and could not \ndistinguish her reflection from the others. All \nwas blended into one brilliant procession. On \nentering the ballroom the regular hum of \nvoices, footsteps, and greetings deafened Na- \ntdsha, and the light and glitter dazzled her still \nmore. The host and hostess, who had already \nbeen standing at the door for half an hour re- \npeating the same words to the various arrivals, \n"Charmt de vous voir" l greeted the Rost6vs \nand Per6nskaya in the same manner. \n\nThe two girls in their white dresses, each \nwith a rose in her black hair, both curtsied in \nthe same way, but the hostess' eye involuntarily \nrested longer on the slim Natasha. She looked \nat her and gave her alone a special smile in \naddition to her usual smile as hostess. Looking \nat her she may have recalled the golden, irre- \ncoverable days of her own girlhood and her \nown first ball. The host also followed Natdsha \nwith his eyes and asked the count which was \nhis daughter. \n\n"Charming!" said he, kissing the tips of his \nfingers. \n\nIn the ballroom, guests stood crowding at \nthe entrance doors awaiting the Emperor. The \ncountess took up a position in one of the front \nrows of that crowd. Natdsha heard and felt \nthat several people were asking about her and \nlooking at her. She realized that those noticing \nher liked her, and this observation helped to \ncalm her. \n\n"There are some like ourselves and some \nworse," she thought. \n\nPer6nskaya was pointing out to the count- \ness the most important people at the ball. \n\n"That is the Dutch ambassador, do you see? \nThat gray-haired man," she said, indicating an \nold man with a profusion of silver-gray curly \nhair, who was surrounded by ladies laughing at \nsomething he said. \n\n1 "Delighted to sec you." \n\n\n\nBOOK SIX \n\n\n\n257 \n\n\n\n"Ah, here she is, the Queen of Petersburg, \nCountess Bezukhova," said Per6nskaya, indi- \ncating Hlne who had just entered. "How \nlovely! She is quite equal to Marya Ant6nov- \nna. 1 See how the men, young and old, pay court \nto her. Beautiful and clever . . . they say Prince \n\nis quite mad about her. But see, those two, \n\nthough not good-looking, are even more run \nafter." \n\nShe pointed to a lady who was crossing the \nroom followed by a very plain daughter. \n\n"She is a splendid match, a millionairess," \nsaid Per6nskaya. "And look, here come her \nsuitors." \n\n"That is Bezukhova's brother, Anatole Ku- \nragin," she said, indicating a handsome officer \nof the Horse Guards who passed by them with \nhead erect, looking at somcthingover the heads \nof the ladies. "He's handsome, isn't he? I hear \nthey will marry him to that rich girl. But your \ncousin, Drubetsk6y, is also very attentive to \nher. They say she has millions. Oh yes, that's \nthe French ambassador himself!" she replied \nto the countess' inquiry about Caulaincourt. \n"Looks as if he were a king! All the same, the \nFrench are charming, very charming. No one \nmore charming in society. Ah, here she is! Yes, \nshe is still the most beautiful of them all, our \nMarya Ant6novna! And how simply she is \ndressed! Lovely! And that stout one in spec- \ntacles is the universal Freemason," she went \non, indicating Pierre. "Put him beside his wife \nand he looks a regular buffoon!" \n\nPierre, swaying his stout body, advanced, \nmaking way through the crowd and nodding \nto right and left as casually and good-natured- \nly as if he were passing through a crowd at a \nfair. He pushed through, evidently looking for \nsomeone. \n\nNatasha looked joyfully at the familiar face \nof Pierre, "the buffoon," as Per6nskaya had \ncalled him, and knew he was looking for them, \nand for her in particular. He had promised to \nbe at the ball and introduce partners to her. \n\nBut before he reached them Pierre stopped \nbeside a very handsome, dark man of middle \nheight, and in a white uniform, who stood by \na window talking to a tall man wearing stars \nand a ribbon. Natasha at once recognized the \nshorter and younger man in the white uni- \nform: it was Bolk6nski, who seemed to her \nto have grown much younger, happier, and \nbetter-looking. \n\n"There's someone else we know Bolk6nski, \ndo you see, Mamma?" said Natasha, pointing \n\n1 Alexander I's mistress. TR. \n\n\n\nout Prince Andrew. "You remember, he stayed \na night with us at Otradnoe." \n\n"Oh, you know him?" said Per6nskaya. "I \ncan't bear him. // fait &amp; present la pluie et le \nbeau temps. 9 He's too proud for anything. \nTakes after his father. And he's hand in glove \nwith Sperdnski, writing some project or other. \nJust look how he treats the ladies! There's one \ntalking to him and he has turned away," she \nsaid, pointing at him. "I'd give it to him if he \ntreated me as he does those ladies." \n\nCHAPTER XVI \n\nSUDDENLY EVERYBODY STIRRED, began talking, \nand pressed forward and then back, and be- \ntween the two rows, which separated, the Em- \nperor entered to the sounds of music that had \nimmediately struck up. Behind him walked his \nhost and hostess. He walked in rapidly, bow- \ning to right and left as if anxious to get the \nfirst moments of the reception over. The band \nplayed the polonaise in vogue at that time on \naccount of the words that had been set to it, \nbeginning: "Alexander, Elisaveta, all our hearts \nyou ravish quite ..." The Emperor passed on \nto the drawing room, the crowd made a rush \nfor the doors, and several persons with excited \nfaces hurried there and back again. Then the \ncrowd hastily retired from the drawing-room \ndoor, at which the Emperor reappeared talk- \ning to the hostess. A young man, looking dis- \ntraught, pounced down on the ladies, asking \nthem to move aside. Some ladies, with faces be- \ntraying complete forgetfulness of all the rules \nof decorum, pushed forward to the detriment \nof their toilets. The men began to choose part- \nners and take their places for the polonaise. \n\nEveryone moved back, and the Emperor \ncame smiling out of the drawing room leading \nhis hostess by the hand but not keeping time \nto the music. The host followed with Marya \nAnt6novna Naryshkina; then came ambassa- \ndors, ministers, and various generals, whom \nPer6nskaya diligently named. More than half \nthe ladies already had partners and were tak- \ning up, or preparing to take up, their positions \nfor the polonaise. Natasha felt that she would \nbe left with her mother and S6nya among a \nminority of women who crowded near the wall, \nnot having been invited to dance. She stood \nwith her slender arms hanging down, her \nscarcely defined bosom rising and falling regu- \nlarly, and with bated breath and glittering, \nfrightened eyes gazed straight before her, evi- \ndently prepared for the height of joy or misery. \n\n8 "He is all the rage just now." \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nShe was not concerned about the Emperor or \nany of those great people whom Per6nskaya \nwas pointing out she had but one thought: \n"Is it possible no one will ask me, that I shall \nnot be among the first to dance? Is it possible \nthat not one of all these men will notice me? \nThey do not even seem to see me, or if they do \nthey look as if they were saying, 'Ah, she's not \nthe one I'm after, so it's not worth looking at \nher!' No, it's impossible," she thought. "They \nmust know how I long to dance, how splendid- \nly I dance, and how they would enjoy dancing \nwith me." \n\nThe strains of the polonaise, which had con- \ntinued for a considerable time, had begun to \nsound like a sad reminiscence in Natasha's ears. \nShe wanted to cry. Per6nskaya had left them. \nThe count was at the other end of the room. \nShe and the countess and S6nya were standing \nby themselves as in the depths of a forest amid \nthat crowd of strangers, with no one interested \nin them and not wanted by anyone. Prince An- \ndrew with a lady passed by, evidently not recog- \nnizing them. The handsome Anatole was smil- \ningly talking to a partner on his arm and \nlooked at Natdsha as one looks at a wall. Boris \npassed them twice and each time turned away. \nBerg and his wife, who were not dancing, came \nup to them. \n\nThis family gathering seemed humiliating \nto Natdsha as if there were nowhere else for \nthe family to talk but here at the ball. She did \nnot listen to or look at Vera, who was telling \nher something about her own green dress. \n\nAt last the Emperor stopped beside his last \npartner (he had danced with three) and the \nmusic ceased. A worried aide-de-camp ran up \nto the Rostrivs requesting them to stand far- \nther back, though as it was they were already \nclose to the wall, and from the gallery re- \nsounded the distinct, precise, enticingly rhyth- \nmical strains of a waltz. The Emperor looked \nsmilingly down the room. A minute passed but \nno one had yet begun dancing. An aide-de- \ncamp, the Master of Ceremonies, went up to \nCountess Bezukhova and asked her to dance. \nShe smilingly raised her hand and laid it on \nhis shoulder without looking at him. The aide- \nde-camp, an adept in his art, grasping his part- \nner firmly round her waist, with confident de- \nliberation started smoothly, gliding first round \nthe edge of the circle, then at the corner of the \nroom he caught Hlne's left hand and turned \nher, the only sound audible, apart from the \never-quickening music, being the rhythmic click \nof the spurs on his rapid, agile feet, while at \n\n\n\nevery third beat his partner's velvet dress spread \nout and seemed to flash as she whirled round. \nNatdsha gazed at them and was ready to cry \nbecause it was not she who was dancing that \nfirst turn of the waltz. \n\nPrince Andrew, in the white uniform of a \ncavalry colonel, wearing stockings and danc- \ning shoes, stood looking animated and bright \nin the front row of the circle not far from the \nRost6vs. Baron Firhoff was talking to him \nabout the first sitting of the Council of State to \nbe held next day. Prince Andrew, as one close- \nly connected with Sperdnski and participating \nin the work of the legislative commission, could \ngive reliable information about that sitting, \nconcerning which various rumors were cur- \nrent. But not listening to what Firhoff was say- \ning, he was gazing now at the sovereign and \nnow at the men intending to dance who had \nnot yet gathered courage to enter the circle. \n\nPrince Andrew was watching these men \nabashed by the Emperor's presence, and the \nwomen who were breathlessly longing to be \nasked to dance. \n\nPierre came up to him and caught him by \nthe arm. \n\n"You always dance. I have a protge*e, the \nyoung Rost6va, here. Ask her," he said. \n\n"Where is she?" asked Bolk6nski. "Excuse \nme!" he added, turning to the baron, "we will \nfinish this conversation elsewhere at a ball \none must dance." He stepped forward in the \ndirection Pierre indicated. The despairing, de- \njected expression of Natdsha's face caught his \neye. He recognized her, guessed her feelings, \nsaw that it was her dbut, remembered her \nconversation at the window, and with an ex- \npression of pleasure on his face approached \nCountess Rost6va. \n\n"Allow me to introduce you to my daughter," \nsaid the countess, with heightened color. \n\n"I have the pleasure of being already ac- \nquainted, if the countess remembers me," said \nPrince Andrew with a low and courteous bow \nquite belying Per6nskaya's remarks about his \nrudeness, and approaching Natdsha he held \nout his arm to grasp her waist before he had \ncompleted his invitation. He asked her to waltz. \nThat tremulous expression on Natdsha's face, \nprepared either for despair or rapture, sud- \ndenly brightened into a happy, grateful, child- \nlike smile. \n\n"I have long been waiting for you," that \nfrightened happy little girl seemed to say by \nthe smile that replaced the threatened tears, as \nshe raised her hand to Prince Andrew's shoul- \n\n\n\nBOOK SIX \n\n\n\nder. They were the second couple to enter the \ncircle. Prince Andrew was one of the best danc- \ners of his day and Natasha danced exquisitely. \nHer little feetin their white satin dancing shoes \ndid their work swiftly, lightly, and independ- \nently of herself, while her face beamed with \necstatic happiness. Her slender bare arms and \nneck werenot beautiful compared to Helene's \nher shoulders looked thin and her bosom un- \ndeveloped. But Helene seemed, as it were, hard- \nened by a varnish left by the thousands of looks \nthat had scanned her person, while Natasha was \nlike a girl exposed for the first time, who would \nhave felt very much ashamed had she not been \nassured that this was absolutely necessary. \n\nPrince Andrew liked dancing, and wishing to \nescape as quickly as possible from the political \nand clever talk which everyone addressed to \nhim, wishing also to break up the circle of re- \nstraint he disliked, caused by the Emperor's \npresence, he danced, and had chosen Natasha \nbecause Pierre pointed her out to him and be- \ncause she was the first pretty girl who caught \nhis eye; but scarcely had he embraced that slen- \nder supple figure and felt her stirring so close \nto him and smiling so near him than the wine \nof her charm rose to his head, and he felt him- \nself revived and rejuvenated when after leav- \ning her he stood breathing deeply and watch- \ning the other dancers. \n\nCHAPTER XVII \n\nAFTER PRINCE ANDREW, Boris came up to ask \nNatasha fora dance, and then the aide-de-camp \nwho had opened the ball, and several other \nyoung men, so that, flushed and happy, and \npassing on her superfluous partners to S6nya, \nshe did not cease dancing all the evening. She \nnoticed and saw nothing of what occupied ev- \neryone else. Not only did she fail to notice that \nthe Emperor talked a long time with the French \nambassador, and how particularly gracious he \nwas to a certain lady, or that Prince So-and-so \nand So-and-so did and said this and that, and \nthat Helene had great success andwashonored \nby the special attention of So-and-so, but she \ndid not even see the Emperor, and only noticed \nthat he had gone because the ball became live- \nlier after his departure. For one of the merry \ncotillions before supper Prince Andrew was \nagain her partner. He reminded her of their \nfirst encounter in the Otradnoe avenue, and \nhow she had been unable to sleep that moon- \nlight night, and told her how he had involun- \ntarily overheard her. Natasha blushed at that \nrecollection and tried to excuse herself, as if \n\n\n\nthere had been something to be ashamed of in \nwhat Prince Andrew had overheard. \n\nLike all men who have grown up in society, \nPrince Andrew liked meeting someone there \nnotof the conventional society stamp. Andsuch \nwas Natasha, with her surprise, her delight, her \nshyness, and even her mistakes in speaking \nFrench. With her he behaved with special care \nand tenderness, sitting beside her and talking \nof the simplest and most unimportant matters; \nhe admired her shy grace. In the middle of the \ncotillion, having completed one of the figures, \nNatdsha, still out of breath, was returning to \nher seat when another dancer chose her. She \nwas tired and panting and evidently thought \nof declining, but immediately put her hand \ngaily on the man's shoulder, smiling at Prince \nAndrew. \n\n"I'd be glad to sit beside you and rest: I'm \ntired; but you see how they keep asking me, \nand I'm glad of it, I'm happy and I love every- \nbody, and you and I understand it all," and \nmuch, much more was said in her smile. When \nher partner left her Natasha ran across the \nroom to choose two ladies for the figure. \n\n"If she goes to her cousin first and then to \nanother lady, she will be my wife," said Prince \nAndrew to himself quite to his own surprise, as \nhe watched her. She did go first to her cousin. \n\n"Whatrubbish sometimes enters one's head 1" \nthought Prince Andrew, "but what is certain is \nthat that girl is so charming, so original, that \nshe won't be dancing here a month before she \nwill be married. . . . Such as she are rare here," \nhe thought, as Natdsha, readjusting a rose that \nwas slipping on her bodice, settled herself be- \nside him. \n\nWhen the cotillion was over the old count in \nhis blue coat came up to the dancers. He invit- \ned Prince Andrew to come and see them, and \nasked his daughter whether she was enjoying \nherself. Natdsha did not answer at once but \nonly looked up with a smile that said reproach- \nfully: "How can you ask such a question?" \n\n"I have never enjoyed myself so much be- \nforel" she said, and Prince Andrew noticed \nhow her thin arms rose quickly as if to embrace \nher father and instantly dropped again. Nata- \nsha was happier than she had ever been in her \nlife. She was at that height of bliss when one \nbecomes completely kind and good and does \nnot believe in the possibility of evil, unhappi- \nness, or sorrow. \n\nAt that ball Pierre for the first time felt \nhumiliated by the position his wife occupied \nin court circles. He was gloomy and absent- \n\n\n\n260 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nminded. A deep furrow ran across his fore- \nhead, and standing by a window he stared \nover his spectacles seeing no one. \n\nOn her way to supper Natasha passed him. \n\nPierre's gloomy, unhappy look struck her. \nShe stopped in front of him. She wished to help \nhim, to bestow on him the superabundance of \nher own happiness. \n\n"How delightful it is, Count!"said she. "Isn't \nit?" \n\nPierre smiled absent-mindedly, evidently not \ngrasping what she said. \n\n"Yes, I am very glad," he said. \n\n"How can people be dissatisfied with any- \nthing?" thought Natdsha. "Especially such a \ncapital fellow as Bezukhov!" In Natasha's eyes \nall the people at the ball alike were good, kind, \nand splendid people, loving one another; none \nof them capable of injuring another and so \nthey ought all to be happy. \n\nCHAPTER XVIII \n\nNEXT DAY Prince Andrew thought of the ball, \nbut his mind did not dwell on it long. "Yes, it \nwas a very brilliant ball," and then . . . "Yes, \nthat little Rost6va is very charming. There's \nsomething fresh, original, un-Petersburg-like \nabout her that distinguishes her." That was all \nhe thought about yesterday's ball, and after his \nmorning tea he set to work. \n\nBut either from fatigue or want of sleep he \nwas ill-disposed for work and could get noth- \ning done. He kept criticizing his own work, as \nhe often did, and was glad when he heard some- \none coming. \n\nThe visitor was Bftski, who served on var- \nious committees, frequented all the societies in \nPetersburg, and was a passionate devotee of the \nnew ideas and of Sperdnski, and a diligent Pe- \ntersburg newsmonger one of those men who \nchoose their opinions like their clothes accord- \ning to the fashion, but who for that very reason \nappear to be the wannest partisans. Hardly \nhad he got rid of his hat before he ran into \nPrince Andrew's room with a preoccupied air \nand at once began talking. He had just heard \nparticulars of that morning's sitting of the \nCouncil of State opened by the Emperor, and \nhe spoke of it enthusiastically. The Emperor's \nspeech had been extraordinary. It had been a \nspeech such as only constitutional monarchs \ndeliver. "The Sovereign plainly said that the \nCouncil and Senate are estates of the realm, he \nsaid that the government must rest not on au- \nthority but on secure bases. The Emperor said \nthat the fiscal system must be reorganized and \n\n\n\nthe accounts published," recounted Bitski, em- \nphasizing certain words and opening his eyes \nsignificantly. \n\n"Ah, yesl Today's events mark an epoch, the \ngreatest epoch in our history," he concluded. \n\nPrince Andrew listened to the account of \nthe opening of the Council of State, which he \nhad so impatiently awaited and to which he \nhad attached such importance, and was sur- \nprised that this event, now that it had taken \nplace, did not affect him, and even seemed \nquite insignificant. He listened with quiet \nirony to Bitski's enthusiastic account of it. A \nvery simple thought occurred to him: "What \ndoes it matter to me or to Bftski what the Em- \nperor was pleased to say at the Council? Can \nall that make me any happier or better?" \n\nAnd this simple reflection suddenly destroyed \nall the interest Prince Andrew had felt in the \nimpending reforms. He was going to dine that \nevening at Sperdnski's, "with only a few \nfriends," as the host had said when inviting \nhim. The prospect of that dinner in the inti- \nmate home circle of the man he so admired had \ngreatly interested Prince Andrew, especially as \nhe had not yet seen Sperdnski in his domestic \nsurroundings, but now he felt disinclined to go \nto it. \n\nAt the appointed hour, however, he entered \nthe modest house Sperdnski owned in the Tau- \nrida Gardens. In the parqueted dining room of \nthis small house, remarkable for its extreme \ncleanliness (suggesting that of a monastery), \nPrince Andrew, who was rather late, found \nthe friendly gathering of Sperdnski's intimate \nacquaintances already assembled at five o'clock. \nThere were no ladies present except Sperdnski's \nlittle daughter (long-faced like her father) and \nher governess. The other guests were Gervais, \nMagnftski, and Stoly'pin. While still in the an- \nteroom Prince Andrew heard loud voices and \na ringing staccato laugh a laugh such as one \nhears on the stage. Someone it sounded like \nSperdnski was distinctly ejaculating ha-ha-ha. \nPrince Andrew had never before heard Sperdn- \nski's famous laugh, and this ringing, high- \npitched laughter from a statesman made a \nstrange impression on him. \n\nHe entered the din ing room. The whole com- \npany were standing between two windows at \na small table laid with hors-d'oeuvres. Speran- \nski, wearing a gray swallow-tail coat with a star \non the breast, and evidently still the same waist- \ncoat and high white stock he had worn at the \nmeeting of the Council of State, stood at the \ntable with a beaming countenance. His guests \n\n\n\nBOOK SIX \n\n\n\n261 \n\n\n\nsurrounded him. Magnitski, addressing him- \nself to Sperdnski, was relating an anecdote, \nand Sperdnski was laughing in advance at what \nMagnitski was going to say. When Prince An- \ndrew entered the room Magnitski's words were \nagain crowned by laughter. Stolypin gave a \ndeep bass guffaw as he munched a piece of bread \nand cheese. Gervais laughed softly with a hiss- \ning chuckle, and Sperdnski in a high-pitched \nstaccato manner. \n\nStill laughing, Sperdnski held out his soft \nwhite hand to Prince Andrew. \n\n"Very pleased to see you, Prince/' he said. \n"Onemoment . . ." he wenton, turning to Mag- \nnftski and interrupting his story. "We have \nagreed that this is a dinner for recreation, with \nnot a word about business!" and turning again \nto the narrator he began to laugh afresh. \n\nPrince Andrew looked at the laughing Spe- \nrdnski with astonishment, regret, and disillu- \nsionment. It seemed to him that this was not \nSperdnski but someone else. Everything that \nhad formerly appeared mysterious and fascinat- \ning in Sperdnski suddenly became plain and \nunattractive. \n\nAt dinner the conversation did not cease for \na moment and seemed to consist of the contents \nof a book of funny anecdotes. Before Magnft- \nski had finished his story someone else was anx- \nious to relate something still funnier. Most of \nthe anecdotes, if not relating to the state serv- \nice, related to people in the service. It seemed \nthat in this company the insignificance of those \npeople was so definitely accepted that the only \npossible attitude toward them was one of good- \nhumored ridicule. Sperdnski related how at the \nCouncil that morning a deaf dignitary, when \nasked his opinion, replied that he thought so \ntoo. Gervais gave a long account of an official \nrevision, remarkable for the stupidity of every- \nbody concerned. Stolypin, stuttering, broke in- \nto the conversation and began excitedly talk- \ning of the abuses that existed under the former \norder of things threatening to give a serious \nturn to the conversation. Magnitski starting \nquizzing Stolypin about his vehemence. Ger- \nvais intervened with a joke, and the talk revert- \ned to its former lively tone. \n\nEvidently Sperdnski liked to rest after his \nlabors and find amusement in a circle of \nfriends, and his guests, understanding his wish, \ntried to enliven him and amuse themselves. But \ntheir gaiety seemed to Prince Andrew mirthless \nand tiresome. Sperdn ski's high-pitched voice \nstruck him unpleasantly, and the incessant \nlaughter grated on him like a false note. Prince \n\n\n\nAndrew didnot laugh and feared that hewould \nbe a damper on the spirits of the company, but \nno one took any notice of his being out of har- \nmony with the general mood. They all seemed \nvery gay. \n\nHe tried several times to join in the conver- \nsation, but his remarks were tossed aside each \ntime like a cork thrown out of the water, and \nhe could not jest with them. \n\nThere was nothing wrong or unseemly in \nwhat they said, it was witty and might have \nbeen funny, but it lacked just that something \nwhich is the salt of mirth, and they were not \neven aware that such a thing existed. \n\nAfter dinner Sperdnski's daughter and her \ngoverness rose. He patted the little girl with \nhis white hand and kissed her. And that ges- \nture, too, seemed unnatural to Prince Andrew. \n\nThe men remained at table over their port- \nEnglish fashion. In the midst of a conversation \nthat was started about Napoleon's Spanish af- \nfairs, which they all agreed in approving, \nPrince Andrew began to express a contrary \nopinion. Sperdnski smiled and, with an evi- \ndent wish to prevent the conversation from \ntaking an unpleasant course, told a story that \nhad no connection with the previous conver- \nsation. For a few moments all were silent. \n\nHaving sat some time at table, Sperdnski \ncorked a bottle of wine and, remarking, "Now- \nadays good wine rides in a carriage and pair," \npassed it to the servant and got up. All rose and \ncontinuing to talk loudly went into the drawing \nroom. Two letters brought by a courier were \nhanded to Sperdnski and he took them to his \nstudy. As soon as he had left the room the gen- \neral merriment stopped and the guests began \nto converse sensibly and quietly with one an- \nother. \n\n"Now for the recitation!" said Sperdnski on \nreturn ing from his study. "A wonderful talent!" \nhe said to Prince Andrew, and Magnftski im- \nmediately assumed a pose and began reciting \nsome humorous verses in French which he had \ncomposed about various well-known Peters- \nburg people. He was interrupted several times \nby applause. When the verses were finished \nPrince Andrew went up to Sperdnski and took \nhis leave. \n\n"Where are you off to so early?" asked Spe- \nrdnski. \n\n"I promised to go to a reception." \n\nThey said no more. Prince Andrew looked \nclosely into those mirrorlike, impenetrable \neyes, and felt that it had been ridiculous of him \nto have expected anything from Sperdnski and \n\n\n\n26* \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nfrom any of his own activities connected with \nhim, or ever to have attributed importance to \nwhat Sperdnski was doing. That precise, mirth- \nless laughter rang in Prince Andrew's ears long \nafter he had left the house. \n\nWhen he reached home Prince Andrew be- \ngan thinking of his life in Petersburg during \nthose last four months as if it were something \nnew. He recalled his exertions and solicitations, \nand the history of his project of army reform, \nwhich had been accepted for consideration and \nwhich they were trying to pass over in silence \nsimply because another, a very poor one, had \nalready been prepared and submitted to the \nEmperor. He thought of the meetings of a com- \nmittee of which Berg was a member. He remem- \nbered how carefully and at what length every- \nthing relating to form and procedure was dis- \ncussed at those meetings, and how sedulously \nand promptly all that related to the gist of the \nbusiness was evaded. He recalled his labors on \nthe Legal Code, and how painstakingly he had \ntranslated the articles of the Roman and French \ncodes into Russian, and he felt ashamed of him- \nself. Then he vividly pictured to himself Bo- \nguchdrovo, his occupations in the country, his \njourney to Ryazan; he remembered the peas- \nants and Dron the village elder, and mentally \napplying to them the Personal Rights he had \ndivided into paragraphs, he felt astonished that \nhe could have spent so much time on such use- \nless work. \n\nCHAPTER XIX \n\nNEXT DAY Prince Andrew called at a few houses \nhe had not visited before, and among them at \nthe Rost6vs' with whom he had renewed ac- \nquaintance at the ball. Apart from considera- \ntions of politeness which demanded the call, he \nwanted to see that original, eager girl who had \nleft such a pleasant impression on his mind, in \nher own home. \n\nNatdsha was one of the first to meet him. She \nwas wearing a dark-blue house dress in which \nPrince Andrew thought her even prettier than \nin her ball dress. She and all the Rost6v family \nwelcomed him as an old friend, simply and cor- \ndially. The whole family, whom he had former- \nly judged severely, now seemed to him to con- \nsist of excellent, simple, and kindly people. The \nold count's hospitality and good nature, which \nstruck one especially in Petersburg as a pleas- \nant surprise, were such that Prince Andrew \ncould not refuse to stay to dinner. "Yes," he \nthought, "they are capital people, whoof course \nhave not the slightest idea what a treasure they \n\n\n\npossess in Natdsha; but they are kindly folk and \nform the best possible setting for this striking- \nly poetic, charming girl, overflowing with life!" \n\nIn Natdsha Prince Andrew was conscious of \na strange world completely alien to him and \nbrimful of joys unknown to him, a different \nworld, that in the Otrddnoe avenue and at the \nwindow that moonlight night had already be- \ngun to disconcert him. Now this world discon- \ncerted him no longer and was no longer alien \nto him, but he himself having entered it found \nin it a new enjoyment. \n\nAfter dinner Natdsha, at Prince Andrew's re- \nquest, went to the clavichord and began sing- \ning. Prince Andrew stood by a window talking \nto the ladies and listened to her. In the midst \nof a phrase he ceased speaking and suddenly \nfelt tears choking him, a thing he had thought \nimpossible for him. He looked at Natdsha as \nshe sang, and something new and joyful stirred \nin his soul. He felt happy and at the same time \nsad. He had absolutely nothing to weep about \nyet he was ready to weep. What about? His \nformer love? The little princess? His disillu- \nsionments? . . . His hopes for the future? . . . \nYes and no. The chief reason was a sudden, viv- \nid sense of the terrible contrast between some- \nthing infinitely great and illimitable within \nhim and that limited and material something \nthat he, and even she, was. This contrast \nweighed on and yet cheered himwhileshesang. \n\nAs soon as Natdsha had finished she went up \nto him and asked how he liked her voice. She \nasked this and then became confused, feeling \nthat she ought not to have asked it. He smiled, \nlooking at her, and said he liked her singing as \nhe liked everything she did. \n\nPrince Andrew left the Rost6vs' late in the \nevening. He went to bed from habit, but soon \nrealized that he could not sleep. Having lit his \ncandle he sat up in bed, then got up, then lay \ndown again not at all troubled by his sleepless- \nness: his soul was as fresh and joyful as if he \nhad stepped out of a stuffy room into God's \nown fresh air. It did not enter his head that he \nwas in love with Natdsha; he was not thinking \nabout her, but only picturing her to himself, \nand in consequence all life appeared in a new \nlight. "Why do I strive, why do I toil in this \nnarrow, confined frame, when life, all life with \nall its joys, is open to me?" said he to himself. \nAnd for the first time for a very long while he \nbegan making happy plans for the future. He \ndecided that he must attend to his son's educa- \ntion by finding a tutor and putting the boy in \nhis charge, then he ought to retire from theserv- \n\n\n\nBOOK SIX \n\n\n\n263 \n\n\n\nice and go abroad, and see England, Switzer- \nland, and Italy. "I must use my freedom while \nI feel so much strength and youth in me," he \nsaid to himself. "Pierre was right when he said \none must believe in the possibility of happiness \nin order to be happy, and now I do believe in \nit. Let the dead bury their dead, but while one \nhas life one must live and be happy!" thought \nhe. \n\nCHAPTER XX \n\nONE MORNING Colonel Berg, whom Pierre knew \nas he knew everybody in Moscow and Peters- \nburg, came to see him. Berg arrived in an im- \nmaculate brand-new uniform, with his hair po- \nmaded and brushed forward over his temples \nas the Emperor Alexander wore his hair. \n\n"I have just been to see the countess, your \nwife. Unfortunately she could not grant my re- \nquest, but I hope, Count, I shall be more for- \ntunate with you," he said with a smile. \n\n"What is it you wish, Colonel? I am at your \nservice." \n\n"I have now quite settled in my new rooms, \nCount" (Berg said this with perfect conviction \nthat this information could not but be agree- \nable), "and so I wish to arrange just a small par- \nty formy own and my wife's friends." (Hesmiled \nstill more pleasantly.) "I wished to ask the \ncountess and you to do me the honor of coming \nto tea and to supper." \n\nOnly Countess Hlne, considering the soci- \nety of such people as the Bergs beneath her, \ncould be cruel enough to refuse such an invita- \ntion. Berg explained so clearly why he wanted \nto collect at his house a small but select com- \npany, and why this would give him pleasure, \nand why though he grudged spending money \n,on cards or anything harmful, he was prepared \nto run into some expense for the sake of good \nsocietythat Pierre could not refuse, and \npromised to come. \n\n"But don't be late, Count, if I may venture \nto ask; about ten minutes to eight, please. We \nshall make up a rubber. Our general is coming. \nHe is very good to me. We shall have supper, \nCount. So you will do me the favor." \n\nContrary to his habit of being late, Pierre \non that day arrived at the Bergs' house, not at \nten but at fifteen minutes to eight. \n\nHaving prepared everything necessary for \nthe party, the Bergs were ready for their guests' \narrival. \n\nIn their new, clean, and light study with its \nsmall busts and pictures and new furniture sat \nBerg and his wife. Berg, closely buttoned up \n\n\n\nin his new uniform, sat beside his wife explain- \ning to her that one always could and should be \nacquainted with people above one, because on- \nly then does one get satisfaction from acquaint- \nances. \n\n"You can get to know something, you can \nask for something. See how I managed from \nmy first promotion." (Berg measured his life \nnot by years but by promotions.) "My comrades \nare still nobodies, while I am only waiting for \na vacancy to command a regiment, and have \nthe happiness to be your husband." (He rose \nand kissed Vcra's hand, and on the way to her \nstraightened out a turned-up corner of the car- \npet.) "And how have I obtained all this? Chief- \nly by knowing how to choose my acquaintances. \nIt goes without saying that one must be consci- \nentious and methodical." \n\nBerg smiled with a sense of his superiority \nover a weak woman, and paused, reflecting that \nthis dear wife of his was after all but a weak \nwoman who could not understand all that con- \nstitutes a man's dignity, what it was ein Mann \nzu sein.* Wra at the same time was smiling with \na sense of superiority over her good, conscien- \ntious husband, who all the same understood \nlife wrongly, as according to Ve*ra all men did. \nBerg, judging by his wife, thought all women \nweak and foolish. Vera, judging only by her \nhusband and generalizing from that observa- \ntion, supposed that all men, though they un- \nderstand nothing and are conceited and sel- \nfish, ascribe common sense to themselves alone. \n\nBerg rose and embraced his wife carefully, \nso as not to crush her lace fichu for which he \nhad paid a good price, kissing her straight on \nthe lips. \n\n"The only thing is, we mustn't have chil- \ndren too soon," he continued, following an un- \nconscious sequence of ideas. \n\n"Yes," answered Ve*ra, "I don't at all want \nthat. We must live for society." \n\n"Princess Yusiipova wore one exactly like \nthis," said Berg, pointing to the fichu with a \nhappy and kindly smile. \n\nJust then Count Beziikhov was announced. \nHusband and wife glanced at one another, \nboth smiling with self-satisfaction, and each \nmentally claiming the honor of this visit. \n\n"This is what comes of knowing how to make \nacquaintances," thought Berg. "This is what \ncomes of knowing how to conduct oneself." \n\n"But please don't interrupt me when I am \nentertaining the guests," said Vera, "because I \nknow what interests each of them and what to \n\n1 To be a man. \n\n\n\n264 \n\nsay to different people." \n\nBerg smiled again. \n\n"It can't be helped: men must sometimes \nhave masculine con versa tion," said he. \n\nThey received Pierre in their small, new \ndrawing-room, where it was impossible to sit \ndown anywhere without disturbing its sym- \nmetry, neatness, and order; so it was quite \ncomprehensible and not strange that Berg, hav- \ning generously offered to disturb the symmetry \nof an armchair or of the sofa for his dear guest, \nbut being apparently painfully undecided on \nthe matter himself, eventually left the visitor \nto settle the question of selection. Pierre dis- \nturbed the symmetry by moving a chair for him- \nself, and Berg and V^ra immediately began their \nevening party, interrupting each other in their \nefforts to entertain their guest. \n\nVe*ra, having decided in her own mind that \nPierre ought to be entertained with conversa- \ntion about the French embassy, at once began \naccordingly. Berg, having decided that mascu- \nline conversation was required, interrupted his \nwife's remarks and touched on the question of \nthe war with Austria, and unconsciously \njumped from the general subject to personal \nconsiderations as to the proposals made him to \ntake part in the Austrian campaign and the \nreasons why he had declined them. Though \nthe conversation was very incoherent and Ve*ra \nwas angry at the intrusion of the masculine el- \nement, both husband and wife felt with satis- \nfaction that, even if only one guest was pres- \nent, their evening had begun very well and was \nas like as two peas to every other evening party \nwith its talk, tea, and lighted candles. \n\nBefore long Boris, Berg's old comrade, ar- \nrived. There was a shade of condescension and \npatronage in his treatment of Berg and Ve*ra. \nAfter Boris came a lady with the colonel, then \nthe general himself, then the Rost6vs, and the \nparty became unquestionably exactly like all \nother evening parties. Berg and Ve*ra could not \nrepress their smiles of satisfaction at the sight \nof all this movement in their drawing room, at \nthe sound of the disconnected talk, the rustling \nof dresses, and the bowing and scraping. Every- \nthing was just as everybody always has it, es- \npecially so the general, who admired the apart- \nment, patted Berg on the shoulder, and with \nparental authority superintended the setting \nout of the table for boston. The general sat \ndown by Count Ilya Rost6v, who was next to \nhimself the most important guest. The old peo- \nple sat with the old, the young with the young, \nand the hostess at the tea table, on which stood \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\nexactly the same kind of cakes in a silver cake \n\n\n\nbasket as the Panins had at their party. Every- \nthing was just as it was everywhere else. \n\nCHAPTER XXI \n\nPIERRE, as one of the principal guests, had to \nsit down to boston with Count Rost6v, the \ngeneral, and the colonel. At the card table he \nhappened to be directly facing Natdsha, and \nwas struck by a curious change that had come \nover her since the ball. She was silent, and not \nonly less pretty than at the ball, but only re- \ndeemed from plainness by her look of gentle \nindifference to everything around. \n\n"What's the matter with her?" thought \nPierre, glancing at her. She was sitting by her \nsister at the tea table, and reluctantly, without \nlooking at him, made some reply to Boris who \nsat down beside her. After playing out a \nwhole suit and to his partner's delight taking \nfive tricks, Pierre, hearing greetings and the \nsteps of someone who had entered the room \nwhile he was picking up his tricks, glanced \nagain at Natasha. \n\n"What has happened to her?" he asked him- \nself with still greater surprise. \n\nPrince Andrew was standing before her, \nsaying something to her with a look of tender \nsolicitude. She, having raised her head, w-is \nlooking up at him, flushed and evidently try- \ning to master her rapid breathing. And the \nbright glow of some inner fire that had been \nsuppressed was again alight in her. She was \ncompletely transformed and from a plain girl \nhad again become what she had been at the \nball. \n\nPrince Andrew went up to Pierre, and the \nlatter noticed a new and youthful expression \nin his friend's face. \n\nPierre changed places several times during \nthe game, sitting now with his back to Natdsha \nand now facing her, but during the whole of \nthe six rubbers he watched her and his friend. \n\n"Something very important is happening be- \ntween them," thought Pierre, and a feeling that \nwas both joyful and painful agitated him and \nmade him neglect the game. \n\nAfter six rubbers the general got up, saying \nthat it was no use playing like that, and Pierre \nwas released. Natdsha on one side was talking \nwith S6nya and Boris, and Ve*ra with a subtle \nsmile was saying something to Prince Andrew. \nPierre went up to his friend and, asking wheth- \ner they were talking secrets, sat down beside \nthem. Vra, having noticed Prince Andrew's \nattentions to Natdsha, decided that at a party, \n\n\n\nBOOK SIX \n\n\n\n265 \n\n\n\na real evening party, subtle allusions to the \ntender passion were absolutely necessary and, \nseizing a moment when Prince Andrew was \nalone, began a conversation with him about \nfeelings in general and about her sister. With \nso intellectual a guest as she considered Prince \nAndrew to be, she felt that she had to employ \nher diplomatic tact. \n\nWhen Pierre went up to them he noticed \nthat Vera was being carried away by her self- \nsatisfied talk, but that Prince Andrew seemed \nembarrassed, a thing that rarely happened with \nhim. \n\n"What do you think?" Wra was saying with \nan arch smile. "You are so discerning, Prince, \nand understand people's characters so well at \na glance. What do you think of Natalie? Could \nshe be constant in her attachments? Could she, \nlike other women" (Vra meant herself), "love \na man once for all and remain true to him for- \never? That is what I consider true love. What \ndo you think, Prince?" \n\n"I know your sister too little," replied Prince \nAndrew, with a sarcastic smile under which he \nwished to hide his embarrassment, "to be able \nto solve so delicate a question, and then I have \nnoticed that the less attractive a woman is the \nmore constant she is likely to be," he added, \nand looked up at Pierre who was just approach- \ning them. \n\n"Yes, that is true, Prince. In our days," con- \ntinued Wra mentioning "our days" as peo- \nple of limited intelligence are fond of doing, \nimagining that they have discovered and ap- \npraised the peculiar! ties of "our days" and that \nhuman characteristics change with the times \n"in our days a girl has so much freedom that \nthe pleasure of being courted often stifles real \nfeeling in her. And it must be confessed that \nNatalie is very susceptible." This return to the \nsubject of Natalie caused Prince Andrew to \nknit his brows with discomfort: he was about \nto rise, but Wra continued with a still more \nsubtle smile: \n\n"I think no one has been more courted than \nshe," she went on, "but till quite lately she nev- \ner cared seriously for anyone. Now you know, \nCount," she said to Pierre, "even our dear cous- \nin Boris, who, between ourselves, was very far \ngone in the land of tenderness . . ." (alluding \nto a map of love much in vogue at that time). \n\nPrince Andrew frowned and remained si- \nlent. \n\n"You are friendly with Bods, aren't you?" \nasked V6ra. \n\n"Yes, I know him. ..." \n\n\n\n"I expect he has told you of his childish love \nfor Natasha?" \n\n"Oh, there was childish love?" suddenly asked \nPrince Andrew, blushing unexpectedly. \n\n"Yes, you know between cousins intimacy \noften leads to love. Le cousinage est un dan- \ngereux voisinage* Don't you think so?" \n\n"Oh , undoubtedly I " said Prince Andrew, and \nwith sudden and unnatural liveliness he began \nchaffing Pierre about the need to be very care- \nful with his fifty-year-old Moscow cousins, and \nin the midst of these jesting remarks he rose, \ntaking Pierre by the arm, and drew him aside. \n\n"Well?" asked Pierre, seeing his friend's \nstrange animation with surprise, and noticing \nthe glance he turned on Natisha as he rose. \n\n"I must ... I must have a talk with you," \nsaid Prince Andrew. "You know that pair of \nwomen's gloves?" (He referred to the ftf asonic \ngloves given to a newly initiated Brother to \npresent to the woman he loved.) "I ... but no, \nI will talk to you later on," and with a strange \nlight in his eyes and restlessness in his move- \nments, Prince Andrew approached Natdsha \nand sat down beside her. Pierre saw how Prince \nAndrew asked her something and how she \nflushed as she replied. \n\nBut at that moment Berg came to Pierre and \nbegan insisting that he should take part in an \nargument between the general and the colonel \non the affairs in Spain. \n\nBerg was satisfied and happy. The smile of \npleasure never left his face. The party was very \nsuccessful and quite like other parties he had \nseen. Everything was similar: the ladies' subtle \ntalk, the cards, the general raising his voice at \nthe card table, and the samovar arid the tea \ncakes; only one thing was lacking that he had al- \nways seen at the evening parties he wished to \nimitate. They had not yet had a loud conversa- \ntion among the men and a dispute about some- \nthing important and clever. Now the general \nhad begun such a discussion and so Berg drew \nPierre to it. \n\nCHAPTER XXII \n\nNEXT DAY, having been invited by the count, \nPrince Andrew dined with the Rost6vs and \nspent the rest of the day there. \n\nEveryone in the house realized for whose \nsake Prince Andrew came, and without con- \ncealing it he tried to be with Natdsha all day. \nNot only in the soul of the frightened yet hap- \npy and enraptured Natisha, but in the whole \nhouse, there was a feeling of awe at something \n\n1 "Cousinhood is a dangerous neighbor hood." \n\n\n\n266 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nimportant that was bound to happen. The \ncountess looked with sad and sternly serious \neyes at Prince Andrew when he talked to Na- \ntdsha and timidly started some artificial con- \nversation about trifles as soon as he looked her \nway. S6nya was afraid to leave NatAsha and \nafraid of being in the way when she was with \nthem, Natasha grew pale, in a panic of expec- \ntation, when she remained alone with him for \na moment. Prince Andrew surprised her by his \ntimidity. She felt that he wanted to say some- \nthing to her but could not bring himself to do \nso. \n\nIn the evening, when Prince Andrew had \nleft, the countess went up to Natdsha and \nwhispered: "Well, what?" \n\n"Mamma! For heaven's sake don't ask me \nanything now! One can't talk about that," said \nNatdsha. \n\nBut all the same that night Natdsha, now \nagitated and now frightened, lay a long time in \nher mother's bed gazing straight before her. \nShe told her how he had complimented her, \nhow he told her he was going abroad, asked her \nwhere they were going to spend the summer, \nand then how he had asked her about Boris. \n\n"But such a ... such a ... never happened \nto me before!" she said. "Only I feel afraid in \nhis presence. I am always afraid when I'm with \nhim. What does that mean? Does it mean that \nit's the real thing? Yes? Mamma, are you \nasleep?" \n\n"No, my love; I am frightened myself," an- \nswered her mother. "Now go!" \n\n"All the same I shan't sleep. What silliness, \nto sleep! Mummy! Mummy! such a thing never \nhappened to me before," she said, surprised \nand alarmed at the feeling she was aware of in \nherself. "And could we ever have thought! . . ." \n\nIt seemed to Natdsha that even at the time \nshe first saw Prince Andrew at Otradnoe she \nhad fallen in love with him. It was as if she \nfeared this strange, unexpected happiness of \nmeeting again the very man she had then cho- \nsen (she was firmly convinced she had done so) \nand of finding him, as it seemed, not indiffer- \nent to her. \n\n"And it had to happen that he should come \nspecially to Petersburg while we are here. And \nit had to happen that we should meet at that \nball. It is fate. Clearly it is fate that everything \nled up to this! Already then, directly I saw him \nI felt something peculiar." \n\n"What else did he say to you? What are those \nverses? Read them . . ." said her mother, \nthoughtfully, referring to some verses Prince \n\n\n\nAndrew had written in Natdsha's album. \n\n"Mamma, one need not be ashamed of his \nbeing a widower?" \n\n"Don't, Natdshal Pray to God. 'Marriages \nare made in heaven,' " said her mother. \n\n"Darling Mummy, how I love you! How hap- \npy I am!" cried Natdsha, shedding tears of joy \nand excitement and embracing her mother. \n\nAt that very time Prince Andrew was sitting \nwith Pierre and telling him of his love for Na- \ntdsha and his firm resolve to make her his wife. \n\nThat day Countess Hlene had a reception \nat her house. The French ambassador was there, \nand a foreign prince of the blood who had of \nlate become a frequent visitor of hers, and \nmany brilliant ladies and gentlemen. Pierre, \nwho had come downstairs, walked through the \nrooms and struck everyone by his preoccupied, \nabsent-minded, and morose air. \n\nSince the ball he had felt the approach of a \nfit of nervous depression and had made desper- \nate efforts to combat it. Since the intimacy of \nhis wife with the royal prince, Pierre had un- \nexpectedly been made a gentleman of the bed- \nchamber, and from that time he had begun to \nfeel oppressed and ashamed in court society, \nand dark thoughts of the vanity of all things \nhuman came to him oftener than before. At \nthe same time the feeling he had noticed be- \ntween his protge*e Natasha and Prince An- \ndrew accentuated his gloom by the contrast be- \ntween his own position and his friend's. He \ntried equally to avoid thinking about his wife, \nand about Natasha and Prince Andrew; and \nagain everything seemed to him insignificant \nin comparison with eternity; again the ques- \ntion: for what? presented itself; and he forced \nhimself to work day and night at Masonic la- \nbors, hoping to drive away the evil spirit that \nthreatened him. Toward midnight, after he \nhad left the countess' apartments, he was sit- \nting upstairs in a shabby dressing gown, copy- \ning out the original transactions of the Scottish \nlodge of Freemasons at a table in his low room \ncloudy with tobacco smoke, when someone \ncame in. It was Prince Andrew. \n\n"Ah, it's you!" said Pierre with a preoccu- \npied, dissatisfied air. "And I, you see, am hard \nat it." He pointed to his manuscript book with \nthat air of escaping from the ills of life with \nwhich unhappy people look at their work. \n\nPrince Andrew, with a beaming, ecstatic ex- \npression of renewed life on his face, paused in \nfront of Pierre and, not noticing his sad look, \nsmiled at him with the egotism of joy. \n\n"Well, dear heart," said he, "I wanted to tell \n\n\n\nBOOK \n\nyou about it yesterday and I have come to do \nso today. I never experienced anything like it \nbefore. I am in love, my friend!" \n\nSuddenly Pierre heaved a deep sigh and \ndumped his heavy person down on the sofa be- \nside Prince Andrew. \n\n"With Natdsha Rost6va, yes?" said he. \n\n"Yes, yes! Who else should it be? I should \nnever have believed it, but the feel ing is strong- \ner than I. Yesterday I tormented myself and \nsuffered, but I would not exchange even that \ntorment for anything in the world, I have not \nlived till now. At last I live, but I can't live \nwithout her! But can she love me? ... I am too \nold for her. . . . Why don't you speak?" \n\n"I? I? What did I tell you?" said Pierre sud- \ndenly, rising and beginning to pace up and \ndown the room. "I always thought it. ... That \ngirl is such a treasure . . . she is a rare girl. . . . \nMy dear friend, I entreat you, don't philoso- \nphize, don't doubt, marry, marry, marry. . . . \nAnd I am sure there will not be a happier man \nthan you." \n\n"But what of her?" \n\n"She loves you." \n\n"Don't talk rubbish . . ." said Prince An- \ndrew, smiling and looking into Pierre's eyes. \n\n"She does, I know," Pierre cried fiercely. \n\n"But do listen," returned Prince Andrew, \nholding him by the arm. "Do you know the \ncondition I am in? I must talk about it to some- \none." \n\n"Well, go on, go on. I am very glad," said \nPierre, and his face really changed, his brow be- \ncame smooth, and he listened gladly to Prince \nAndrew. Prince Andrew seemed, and really was, \nquite a different, quite a new man. Where was \nhis spleen, his contempt for life, his disillusion- \nment? Pierre was the only person to whom he \nmade up his mind to speak openly; and to him \nhe told all that was in his soul. Now he boldly \nand lightly made plans for an extended future, \nsaid he could not sacrifice his own happiness to \nhis father's caprice, and spoke of how he would \neither make his father consent to this marriage \nand love her, or would do without his consent; \nthen he marveled at the feeling that had mas- \ntered him as at something strange, apart from \nand independent of himself. \n\n"1 should not have believed anyone who \ntold me that I was capable of such love," said \nPrince Andrew. "It is not at all the same feel- \ning that I knew in the past. The whole world is \nnow for me divided into two halves: one half \nis she, and there all is joy, hope, light: the oth- \ner half is everything where she is not, and there \n\n\n\nSIX 267 \n\nall is gloom and darkness. . . ." \n\n"Darkness and gloom," reiterated Pierre: \n"yes, yes, I understand that." \n\n"I cannot help loving the light, it is not my \nfault. And I am very happy! You understand \nme? I know you are glad for my sake." \n\n"Yes, yes," Pierre assented, looking at his \nfriend with a touched and sad expression in \nhis eyes. The brighter Prince Andrew's lot ap- \npeared to him, the gloomier seemed his own. \n\nCHAPTER XXIII \n\nPRINCE ANDREW needed his father's consent to \nhis marriage, and to obtain this he started for \nthe country next day. \n\nHis father received his son's communication \nwith external composure, but inward wrath. \nHe could not comprehend how anyone could \nwish to alter his life or introduce anythingnew \ninto it, when his own life was already ending. \n"If only they would let me end my days as I \nwant to," thought the old man, "then they \nmight do as they please." With his son, how- \never, he employed the diplomacy he reserved \nfor important occasions and, adopting a quiet \ntone, discussed the whole matter. \n\nIn the first place the marriage was not a bril- \nliant one as regards birth, wealth, or rank. \nSecondly, Prince Andrew was no longer as \nyoung as he had been and his health was poor \n(the old man laid special stress on this), while \nshe was very young. Thirdly, he had a son \nwhom it would be a pity to entrust to a chit of \na girl. "Fourthly and finally," the father said, \nlooking ironically at his son, "I beg you to put \nit off for a year: go abroad, take a cure, look \nout as you wanted to for a German tutor for \nPrince Nicholas. Then if your love or passion \nor obstinacy as you please is still as great, \nmarry! And that's my last word on it. Mind, \nthe last! . . ." concluded the prince, in a tone \nwhich showed that nothing would make him \nalter his decision. \n\nPrince Andrew saw clearly that the old man \nhoped that his feelings, or his fianceVs, would \nnot stand a year's test, or that he (the old prince \nhimself) would die before then, and he de- \ncided to conform to his father's wishto pro- \npose, and postpone the wedding for a year. \n\nThree weeks after the last evening he had \nspent with the Rost6vs, Prince Andrew re- \nturned to Petersburg. \n\nNext day after her talk with her mother Na- \ntdsha expected Bolk6nski all day, but he did \nnot come. On the second and third day it was \n\n\n\n268 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nthe same. Pierre did not come either and Na- \ntdsha, not knowing that Prince Andrew had \ngone to see his father, could not explain his ab- \nsence to herself. \n\nThree weeks passed in this way. Natdsha \nhad no desire to go out any where and wandered \nfrom room to room like a shadow, idle and list- \nless; she wept secretly at night and did not go \nto her mother in the evenings. She blushed \ncontinually and was irritable. It seemed to her \nthat everybody knew about her disappoint- \nment and was laughing at her and pitying her. \nStrong as was her inward grief, this wound to \nher vanity intensified her misery. \n\nOnce she came to her mother, tried to say \nsomething, and suddenly began to cry. Her \ntears were those of an offended child who does \nnot know why it is being punished. \n\nThe countess began to soothe Natdsha, who \nafter first listening to her mother's words, sud- \ndenly interrupted her: \n\n"Leave off, Mamma! I don't think, and don't \nwant to think about ill He just came and then \nleft off, left off. ..." \n\nHer voice trembled, and she again nearly \ncried, but recovered and went on quietly: \n\n"And I don't at all want to get married. And \nI am afraid of him; I have now become quite \ncalm, quite calm." \n\nThe day after this conversation Natdsha put \non the old dress which she knew had the pecul- \niar property of conducing to cheerfulness in \nthe mornings, and that day she returned to the \nold way of life which she had abandoned since \nthe ball. Having finished her morning tea she \nwent to the ballroom, which she particularly \nliked for its loud resonance, and began singing \nher solfeggio. When she had finished her first \nexercise she stood still in the middle of the \nroom and sang a musical phrase that particu- \nlarly pleased her. She listened joyfully (as \nthough she had not expected it) to the charm \nof the notes reverberating, filling the whole \nempty ballroom, and slowly dying away; and \nall at once she felt cheerful. "What's the good \nof making so much of it? Things are nice as it \nis," she said to herself, and she began walking \nup and down the room, not stepping simply \non the resounding parquet but treading with \neach step from the heel to the toe (she had on \na new and favorite pair of shoes) and listening \nto the regular tap of the heel and creak of the \ntoe as gladly as she had to the sounds of her \nown voice. Passing a mirror she glanced into \nit. "There, that's mel" the expression of her \nface seemed to say as she caught sight of her- \n\n\n\nself. "Well, and very nice too! I need nobody." \n\nA footman wanted to come in to clear away \nsomething in the room but she would not let \nhim, and having closed the door behind him \ncontinued her walk. That morning she had re- \nturned to her favorite moodlove of, and de- \nlight in, herself. "How charming that Natdsha \nisl" she said again, speaking as some third, col- \nlective, male person. "Pretty, a good voice, \nyoung, and in nobody's way if only they leave \nher in peace." But however much they left her \nin peace she could not now be at peace, and im- \nmediately felt this. \n\nIn the hall the porch door opened, and some- \none asked, "At home?" and then footsteps were \nheard. Natdsha was looking at the mirror, but \ndid not see herself. She listened to the sounds \nin the hall. When she saw herself, her face was \npale. It was he. She knew this for certain, \nthough she hardly heard his voice through the \nclosed doors. \n\nPale and agitated, Natasha ran into the draw- \ning room. \n\n"Mamma! Bolk6nski has come!" she said. \n"Mamma, it is awful, it is unbearable! I don't \nwant ... to be tormented! What am I to \ndo? . . ." \n\nBefore the countess could answer, Prince \nAndrew entered the room with an agitated and \nserious face. As soon as he saw Natdsha his face \nbrightened. He kissed the countess' hand and \nNatasha's, and sat down beside the sofa. \n\n"It is long since we had the pleasure . . ." be- \ngan the countess, but Prince Andrew inter- \nrupted her by answering her intended ques- \ntion, obviously in haste to say what he had to. \n\n"I have not been to see you all this time be- \ncause I have been at my father's. I had to talk \nover a very important matter with him. I only \ngot back last night," he said glancing at Na- \ntdsha; "I want to have a talk with you, Count- \ness," he added after a moment's pause. \n\nThe countess lowered her eyes, sighing \ndeeply. \n\n"I am at your disposal," she murmured. \n\nNatdsha knew that she ought to go away, \nbut was unable to do so: something gripped \nher throat, and regardlessof manners she stared \nstraight at Prince Andrew with wide-open eyes. \n\n"At once? This instant! . . . No, it can't be!" \nshe thought. \n\nAgain he glanced at her, and that glance con- \nvinced her that she was not mistaken. Yes, at \nonce, that very instant, her fate would be de- \ncided. \n\n"Go, Natasha! I will call you," said the \n\n\n\nBOOK SIX \n\n\n\n269 \n\n\n\ncountess in a whisper. \n\nNatasha glanced with frightened imploring \neyes at Prince Andrew and at her mother and \nwent out. \n\n"I have come, Countess, to ask for your \ndaughter's hand," said Prince Andrew. \n\nThe countess* face flushed hotly, but she \nsaid nothing. \n\n"Your offer . . ." she began at last sedately. \nHe remained silent, looking into her eyes. \n"Your offer . . ." (she grew confused) "is agree- \nable to us, and ... I accept your offer. I am \nglad. And my husband ... I hope . . . but it will \ndepend on her. . . ." \n\n"I will speak to her when I have your con- \nsent Do you give it to me?" said Prince An- \ndrew. \n\n"Yes," replied the countess. She held out her \nhand to him, and with a mixed feeling of es- \ntrangement and tenderness pressed her lips to \nhis forehead as he stooped to kiss her hand. \nShe wished to love him as a son, but felt that to \nher he was a stranger and a terrifying man. "I \nam sure my husband will consent," said the \ncountess, "but your father . . ." \n\n"My father, to whom I have told my plans, \nhas made it an express condition of his consent \nthat the wedding is not to take place for a year. \nAnd I wished to tell you of that," said Prince \nAndrew. \n\n"It is true that Natasha is still young, but \nso long as that? . . ." \n\n"It is unavoidable," said Prince Andrew with \na sigh. \n\n"I will send her to you," said the countess, \nand left the room. \n\n"Lord have mercy upon usl" she repeated \nwhile seeking her daughter. \n\nS6nya said that Natasha was in her bedroom. \nNatasha was sitting on the bed, pale and dry- \neyed, and was gazing at the icons and whisper- \ning something as she rapidly crossed herself. \nSeeing her mother she jumped up and flew to \nher. \n\n"Well, Mamma? . . . Well? . . ." \n\n"Go, go to him. He is asking for your hand," \nsaid the countess, coldly it seemed to Natasha. \n"Go . . . go," said the mother, sadly and re- \nproachfully, with a deep sigh, as her daughter \nran away. \n\nNatasha never remembered how she entered \nthe drawing room. When she came in and saw \nhim she paused. "Is it possible that this stranger \nhas now become everything to me?" she asked \nherself, and immediately answered," Yes, every- \nthingl He alone is now dearer to me than every- \n\n\n\nthing in the world." Prince Andrew came up \nto her with downcast eyes. \n\n"I have loved you from the very first mo- \nment I saw you. May I hope?" \n\nHe looked at her and was struck by the seri- \nous impassioned expression of her face. Her \nface said: "Why ask? Why doubt what you can- \nnot but know? Why speak, when words cannot \nexpress what one feels?" \n\nShe drew near to him and stopped. He took \nher hand and kissed it. \n\n"Do you love me?" \n\n"Yes, yes!" Natasha murmured as if in vexa- \ntion. Then she sighed loudly and, catching her \nbreath more and more quickly, began to sob. \n\n"What is it? What's the matter?" \n\n"Oh, I am so happy!" she replied, smiled \nthrough her tears, bent over closer to him, \npaused for an instant as if asking herself wheth- \ner she might, and then kissed him. \n\nPrince Andrew held her hands, looked into \nher eyes, and did not find in his heart his former \nlove for her. Something in him had suddenly \nchanged; there was no longer the former poetic \nand mystic charm of desire, but there was pity \nfor her feminine and childish weakness, fear \nat her devotion and trustfulness, and an op- \npressive yet joyful sense of the duty that now \nbound him to her forever. The present feeling, \nthough not so bright and poetic as the former, \nwas stronger and more serious. \n\n"Did your mother tell you that it cannot be \nfor a year?" asked Prince Andrew, still looking \ninto her eyes. \n\n"Is it possible that I the 'chit of a girl,' as \neverybody called me," thought Natdsha "is it \npossible that I am now to be the wife and the \nequal of this strange, dear, clever man whom \neven my father looks up to? Can it be true? \nCan it be true that there can be no more play- \ning with life, that now I am grown up, that on \nme now lies a responsibility for my every word \nand deed? Yes, but what did he ask me?" \n\n"No," she replied, but she had not under- \nstood his question. \n\n"Forgive mel" he said. "But you areso young, \nand I have already been through so much in \nlife. I am afraid for you, you do not yet know \nyourself." \n\nNatasha listened wtih concentrated atten- \ntion, trying but failing to take in the meaning \nof his words. \n\n"Hard as this year which delays my happi- \nness will be," continued Prince Andrew, "it \nwill give you time to be sure of yourself. I ask \nyou to make me happy in a year, but you are \n\n\n\n270 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nfree: our engagement shall remain a secret, \nand should you find that you do not love me, \nor should you come to love ..." said Prince \nAndrew with an unnatural smile. \n\n"Why do you say that?" Natdsha interrupted \nhim. "You know that from the very day you \nfirst came to Otrddnoe I have loved you," she \ncried, quite convinced that she spoke the truth. \n\n"In a year you will learn to know your- \nself. . . ." \n\n"A whole year!" Natasha repeated suddenly, \nonly now realizing that the marriage was to be \npostponed for a year. "But why a year? Why a \nyear? . . ." \n\nPrince Andrew began to explain to her the \nreasons for this delay. Natasha did not hear \nhim. \n\n"And can't it be helped?" she asked. Prince \nAndrew did not reply, but his face expressed \nthe impossibility of altering that decision. \n\n"It's awful! Oh, it's awful! awful!" Natdsha \nsuddenly cried, and again burst into sobs. "I \nshall die, waiting a year: it's impossible, it's aw- \nful!" She looked into her lover's face and saw \nin it a look of commiseration and perplexity. \n\n"No, no! I'll do anything!" she said, sudden- \nly checking her tears. "I am so happy." \n\nThe father and mother came into the room \nand gave the betrothed couple their blessing. \n\nFrom that day Prince Andrew began to fre- \nquent the Rost6vs' as Natdsha's affianced lover. \n\nCHAPTER XXIV \n\nNo BETROTHAL CEREMONY took place and Na- \ntdsha's engagement to Bolk6nski was not an- \nnounced; Prince Andrew insisted on that. He \nsaid that as he was responsible for the delay he \nought to bear the whole burden of it; that he \nhad given his word and bound himself forever, \nbut that he did not wish to bind Natdsha and \ngave her perfect freedom. If after six months \nshe felt that she did not love him she would \nhave full right to reject him. Naturally neither \nNatasha nor her parents wished to hear of this, \nbut Prince Andrew was firm. He came every \nday to the Rost6vs', but did not behave to Na- \ntdsha as an affianced lover: he did not use the \nfamiliar thou, but said you to her, and kissed \nonly her hand. After their engagement, quite \ndifferent, intimate, and natural relations sprang \nup between them. It was as if they had not \nknown each other till now. Both liked to re- \ncall how they had regarded each other when \nas yet they were nothing to one another; they \nfelt themselves now quite different beings: \nthen they were artificial, now natural and sin- \n\n\n\ncere. At first the family felt some constraint in \nintercourse with Prince Andrew; he seemed a \nman from another world, and for a long time \nNatdsha trained the family to get used to him, \nproudly assuring them all that he only ap- \npeared to be different, but was really just like \nall of them, and that she was not afraid of him \nand no one else ought to be. After a few days \nthey grew accustomed to him, and without re- \nstraint in his presence pursued their usual way \nof life, in which he took his part. He could talk \nabout rural economy with the count, fashions \nwith the countess and Natdsha, and about al- \nbums and fancywork with S6nya. Sometimes \nthe household both among themselves and in \nhis presence expressed their wonder at how it \nhad all happened, and at the evident omens \nthere had been of it: Prince Andrew's coming \nto Otrddnoe and their coming to Petersburg, \nand the likeness between Natdsha and Prince \nAndrew which her nurse had noticed on his \nfirst visit, and Andrew's encounter with Nich- \nolas in 1805, and many other incidents beto- \nkening that it had to be. \n\nIn the house that poetic dullness and quiet \nreigned which always accompanies the pres- \nence of a betrothed couple. Often when all sit- \nting together everyone kept silent. Sometimes \nthe others would get up and go away and the \ncouple, left alone, still remained silent. They \nrarely spoke of their future life. Prince An- \ndrew was afraid and ashamed to speak of it. \nNatdsha shared this as she did all his feelings, \nwhich she constantly divined. Once she began \nquestioning him about his son. Prince Andrew \nblushed, as he often did now Natdsha particu- \nlarly liked it in him and said that his son \nwould not live with them. \n\n"Why not?" asked Natdsha in a frightened \ntone. \n\n"I cannot take him away from his grand- \nfather, and besides . . ." \n\n"How I should have loved him!" said Na- \ntdsha, immediately guessing his thought; "but \nI know you wish to avoid any pretext for find- \ning fault with us." \n\nSometimes the old count would come up, \nkiss Prince Andrew, and ask his advice about \nPe* tya's education or Nicholas' service. The old \ncountess sighed as she looked at them; S6nya \nwas always getting frightened lest she should \nbe in the way and tried to find excuses for leav- \ning them alone, even when they did not wish \nit. When Prince Andrew spoke (he could tell \na story very well), Natdsha listened to him with \npride; when she spoke she noticed with fear \n\n\n\nBOOK SIX \n\n\n\n271 \n\n\n\nand joy that he gazed attentively and scruti- \nnizingly at her. She asked herself in perplexity: \n"What does he look for in me? He is trying to \ndiscover something by looking at me! What if \nwhat he seeks in me is not there?" Sometimes \nshe fell into one of the mad, merry moods char- \nacteristic of her, and then she particularly loved \nto hear and see how Prince Andrew laughed. \nHe seldom laughed, but when he did he aban- \ndoned himself entirely to his laughter, and aft- \ner such a laugh she always felt nearer to him. \nNatdsha would have been completely happy if \nthe thought of the separation awaiting her and \ndrawing near had not terrified her, just as the \nmere thought of it made him turn pale and \ncold. \n\nOn the eve of his departure from Petersburg \nPrince Andrew brought with him Pierre, who \nhad not been to the Rostovs' once since the \nball. Pierre seemed disconcerted and embar- \nrassed. He was talking to the countess, and Na- \ntdsha sat down beside a little chess table with \nS6nya, thereby inviting Prince Andrew to come \ntoo. He did so. \n\n"You have known Bezukhov a long time?" \nhe asked. "Do you like him?" \n\n"Yes, he's a dear, but very absurd." \n\nAnd as usual when speaking of Pierre, she \nbegan to tell anecdotes of his absent-minded- \nness, some of which had even been invented \nabout him. \n\n"Do you know I have entrusted him with our \nsecret? I have known him from childhood. He \nhas a heart of gold. I beg you, Natalie," Prince \nAndrew said with sudden seriousness "I am \ngoing away and heaven knows what may hap- \npen. You may cease to ... all right, I know I \nam not to say that. Only this, then: whatever \nmay happen to you when I am not here . . ." \n\n"What can happen?" \n\n"Whatever trouble may come," Prince An- \ndrew continued, "I beg you, Mademoiselle \nSophie, whatever may happen, to turn to him \nalone for advice and helpl He is a most absent- \nminded and absurd fellow, but he has a heart \nof gold." \n\nNeither her father, nor her mother, nor S6n- \nya, nor Prince Andrew himself could have fore- \nseen how the separation from her lover would \nact on Natdsha. Flushed and agitated she went \nabout the house all that day, dry-eyed, occupied \nwith most trivial matters as if not understand- \ning what awaited her. She did not even cry \nwhen, on taking leave, he kissed her hand for \nthe last time. "Don't gol" she said in a tone \nthat made him wonder whether he really ought \n\n\n\nnot to stay and which he remembered long aft- \nerwards. Nor did she cry when he was gone; \nbut for several days she sat in her room dry- \neyed, taking no interest in anything and only \nsaying now and then, "Oh, why did he go \n\n\n\nBut a fortnight after his departure, to the \nsurprise of those around her, she recovered \nfrom her mental sickness just as suddenly and \nbecame her old self again, but with a change \nin her moral physiognomy, as a child gets up \nafter a long illness with a changed expression \nof face. \n\nCHAPTER XXV \n\nDURING THAT YEAR after his son's departure, \nPrince Nicholas Bolk6nski's health and temper \nbecame much worse. He grew still more irri- \ntable, and it was Princess Mary who generally \nbore the brunt of his frequent fits of unpro- \nvoked anger. He seemed carefully to seek out \nher tender spots so as to torture her mentally \nas harshly as possible. Princess Mary had two \npassions and consequently two joys her neph- \new, little Nicholas, and religion and these \nwere the favorite subjects of the prince's at- \ntacks and ridicule. Whatever was spoken of he \nwould bring round to the superstitiousness of \nold maids, or the petting and spoiling of chil- \ndren. "You want to make him" little Nicholas \n"into an old maid like yourselfl A pity! \nPrince Andrew wants a son and not an old \nmaid," he would say. Or, turning to Mademoi- \nselle Bourienne, he would ask her in Princess \nMary's presence how she liked our village \npriests and icons and would joke about them. \n\nHe continually hurt Princess Mary's feelings \nand tormented her, but it cost her no effort to \nforgive him. Could he be to blame toward her, \nor could her father, whom she knew loved her \nin spite of it all, be unjust? And what is justice? \nThe princess never thought of that proud word \n"justice." All the complex laws of man cen- \ntered for her in one clear and simple law the \nlaw of love and self-sacrifice taught us by Him \nwho lovingly suffered for mankind though He \nHimself was God. What had she to do with \nthe justice or injustice of other people? She \nhad to endure and love, and that she did. \n\nDuring the winter Prince Andrew had come \nto Bald Hills and had been gay, gentle, and \nmore affectionate than Princess Mary had \nknown him for a long time past. She felt that \nsomething had happened to him, but he said \nnothing to her about his love. Before he left he \nhad a long talk with his father about some- \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nthing, and Princess Mary noticed that before \nhis departure they were dissatisfied with one \nanother. \n\nSoon after Prince Andrew had gone, Prin- \ncess Mary wrote to her friend Julie Karagina \nin Petersburg, whom she had dreamed (as aB \ngirls dream) of marrying to her brother, and \nwho was at that time in mourning for her own \nbrother, killed in Turkey. \n\nSorrow, it seems, is our common lot, my dear, \ntender friend Julie. \n\nYour loss is so terrible that I can only explain it \nto myself as a special providence of God who, lov- \ning you, wishes to try you and your excellent \nmother. Oh, my friend! Religion, and religion \nalone, canI will not say comfort us but save us \nfrom despair. Religion alone can explain to us \nwhat without its help man cannot comprehend: \nwhy, for what cause, kind and noble beings able \nto find happiness in lifenot merely harming no \none but necessary to the happiness of others are \ncalled away to God, while cruel, useless, harmful \npersons, or such as are a burden to themselves and \nto others, are left living. The first death I saw, \nand one I shall never forget that of my dear sis- \nter-in-lawleft that impression on me. Just as you \nask destiny why your splendid brother had to die, \nso I asked why that angel Lise, who not only never \nwronged anyone, but in whose soul there were \nnever any unkind thoughts, had to die. And what \ndo you think, dear friend? Five years have passed \nsince then, and already I, with my petty under- \nstanding, begin to see clearly why she had to die, \nand in what way that death was but an expression \nof the infinite goodness of the Creator, whose \nevery action, though generally incomprehensible \nto us, is but a manifestation of His infinite love \nfor His creatures. Perhaps, I often think, she was \ntoo angelically innocent to have the strength to \nperform all a mother's duties. As a young wife she \nwas irreproachable; perhaps she could not have \nbeen so as a mother. As it is, not only has she left \nus, and particularly Prince Andrew, with the pur- \nest regrets and memories, but probably she will \nthere receive a place I dare not hope for myself. \nBut not to speak of her alone, that early and ter- \nrible death has had the most beneficent influence \non me and on my brother in spite of all our grief. \nThen, at the moment of our loss, these thoughts \ncould not occur to me; I should then have dis- \nmissed them with horror, but now they are very \ndear and certain. I write all this to you, dear \nfriend, only to convince you of the Gospel truth \nwhich has become for me a principle of life: not \na single hair of our heads will fall without His \nwill. And His will is governed only by infinite love \nfor us, and so whatever befalls us is for our good. \n\nYou ask whether we shall spend next winter in \nMoscow. In spite of my wish to see you, I do not \nthink so and do not want to do so. You will be sur- \nprised to hear that the reason for this is Buona- \n\n\n\nparte! The case is this: my father's health is grow- \ning noticeably worse, he cannot stand any contra- \ndiction and is becoming irritable. This irritability \nis, as you know, chiefly directed to political ques- \ntions. He cannot endure the notion that Buona- \nparte is negotiating on equal terms with all the \nsovereigns of Europe and particularly with our \nown, the grandson of the Great Catherine! As you \nknow, I am quite indifferent to politics, but from \nmy father's remarks and his talks with Michael \nIvanovich I know all that goes on in the world \nand especially about the honors conferred on \nBuonaparte, who only at Bald Hills in the whole \nworld, it seems, is not accepted as a great man, \nstill less as Emperor of France. And my father can- \nnot stand this. It seems to me that it is chiefly \nbecause of his political views that my father is re- \nluctant to speak of going to Moscow; for he fore- \nsees the encounters that would result from his way \nof expressing his views regardless of anybody. All \nthe benefit he might derive from a course of treat- \nment he would lose as a result of the disputes \nabout Buonaparte which would be inevitable. In \nany case it will be decided very shortly. \n\nOur family life goes on in the old way except \nfor my brother Andrew's absence. He, as I wrote \nyou before, has changed very much of late. After \nliis sorrow he only this year quite recovered his \nspirits. He has again become as I used to know \nhim when a child: kind, affectionate, with that \nheart of gold to which I know no equal. He has \nrealized, it seems to me, that life is not over for \nhim. But together with this mental change he has \ngrown physically much weaker. He has become \nthinner and more nervous. I am anxious about \nhim and glad he is taking this trip abroad which \nthe doctors recommended long ago. I hope it will \ncure him. You write that in Petersburg he is \nspoken of as one of the most active, cultivated, and \ncapable of the young men. Forgive my vanity as a \nrelation, but I never doubted it. The good he has \ndone to everybody here, from his peasants up to \nthe gentry, is incalculable. On his arrival in Peters- \nburg he received only his due. I always wonder at \nthe way rumors fly from Petersburg to Moscow, es- \npecially such false ones as that you write about I \nmean the report of my brother's betrothal to the \nlittle Rostova. I do not think my brother will ever \nmarry again, and certainly not her; and this is \nwhy: first, I know that though he rarely speaks \nabout the wife he has lost, the grief of that loss has \ngone too deep in his heart for him ever to decide \nto give her a successor and our little angel a step- \nmother. Secondly because, as far as I know, that \ngirl is not the kind of girl who could please Prince \nAndrew. I do not think he would choose her for a \nwife, and frankly I do not wish it. But I am run- \nning on too long and am at the end of my second \nsheet. Good-by, my dear friend. May God keep \nyou in His holy and mighty care. My dear friend, \nMademoiselle Bourienne, sends you kisses. \n\nMARY \n\n\n\nBOOK SIX \n\n\n\n273 \n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI \n\nIN THE MIDDLE of the summer Princess Mary re- \nceived an unexpected letter from Prince An- \ndrew in Switzerland in which he gave her \nstrange and surprising news. He informed her \nof his engagement to Natasha Rostova. The \nwhole letter breathed loving rapture for his \nbetrothed and tender and confiding affection \nfor his sister. He wrote that he had never loved \nas he did now and that only now did he under- \nstand and know what life was. He asked his \nsister to forgive him for not having told her of \nhis resolve when he had last visited Bald Hills, \nthough he had spoken of it to his father. He \nhad not done so for fear Princess Mary should \nask her father to give his consent, irritating \nhim and having to bear the brunt of his dis- \npleasure without attaining her object. "Be- \nsides," he wrote, "the matter was not then so \ndefinitely settled as it is now. My father then \ninsisted on a delay of a year and now already \nsix months, half of that period, have passed, \nand my resolution is firmer than ever. If the \ndoctors did not keep me here at the spas I \nshould be back in Russia, but as it is I have to \npostpone my return for three months. You \nknow me and my relations with Father. I want \nnothing from him. I have been and always \nshall be independent; but to go against his will \nand arouse his anger, now that he may perhaps \nremain with us such a short time, would de- \nstroy half my happiness. I am now writing to \nhim about the same question, and beg you to \nchoose a good moment to hand him the let- \nter and to let me know how he looks at the \nwhole matter and whether there is hope that \nhe may consent to reduce the term by four \nmonths." \n\nAfter long hesitations, doubts, and prayers, \nPrincess Mary gave the letter to her father. The \nnext day the old prince said to her quietly: \n\n"Write and tell your brother to wait till I \nam dead. ... It won't be long I shall soon set \nhim free." \n\nThe princess was about to reply, but her fa- \nther would not let her speak and, raising his \nvoice more and more, cried: \n\n"Marry, marry, my boy! ... A good family I \n. . . Clever people, eh? Rich, eh? Yes, a nice \nstepmother little Nicholas will havel Write \nand tell him that he may marry tomorrow if he \nlikes. She will be little Nicholas' stepmother \nand I'll marry Bouriennel . . . Ha, ha, hal He \nmustn't be without a stepmother either! Only \none thing, no more women are wanted in my \nhouse let him marry and live by himself. Per- \n\n\n\nhaps you will go and live with him too?" he \nadded, turning to Princess Mary. "Go in heav- \nen's name! Go out into the frost . . . the frost \n... the frost!" \n\nAfter this outburst the prince did not speak \nany more about the matter. But repressed vex- \nation at his son's poor-spirited behavior found \nexpression in his treatment of his daughter. \nTo his former pretexts for irony a fresh one \nwas now added allusions to stepmothers and \namiabilities to Mademoiselle Bourienne. \n\n"Why shouldn't I marry her?" he asked his \ndaughter. "She'll make a splendid princess!" \n\nAnd latterly, to her surprise and bewilder- \nment, Princess Mary noticed that her father was \nreally associating more and more with the \nFrenchwoman. She wrote to Prince Andrew \nabout the reception of his letter, but comforted \nhim with hopes of reconciling their father to \nthe idea. \n\nLittle Nicholas and his education, herbroth- \ner Andrew, and religion were Princess Mary's \njoys and consolations; but besides that, since \neveryone must have personal hopes, Princess \nMary in the profoundest depths of her heart \nhad a hidden dream and hope that supplied \nthe chief consolation of her life. This comfort- \ning dream and hope were given her by God's \nfolk the half-witted and other pilgrims who \nvisited her without the prince's knowledge. \nThe longer she lived, the more experience and \nobservation she had of life, the greater was her \nwonder at the shortsightedness of men who seek \nenjoyment and happiness here on earth: toil- \ning, suffering, struggling, and harming one an- \nother, to obtain that impossible, visionary, sin- \nful happiness. Prince Andrew had loved his \nwife, she died, but that was riot enough: he \nwanted to bind his happiness to another wom- \nan. Her father objected to this because he \nwanted a more distinguished and wealthier \nmatch for Andrew. And they all struggled and \nsuffered and tormented one another and in- \njured their souls, their eternal souls, for the at- \ntainment of benefits which endure but for an \ninstant. Not only do we know this ourselves, \nbut Christ, the Son of God, came down to earth \nand told us that this life is but for a moment \nand is a probation; yet we cling to it and think \nto find happiness in it. "How is it that no one \nrealizes this?" thought Princess Mary. "No one \nexcept these despised God's folk who, wallet \non back, come to me by the back door, afraid \nof being seen by the prince, not for fear of ill- \nusage by him but for fear of causing him to sin. \nTo leave family, home, and all the cares of \n\n\n\n*74 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nworldly welfare, in order without clinging to \nanything to wander in hempen rags from place \nto place under an assumed name, doing no one \nany harm but praying for all for those who \ndrive one away as well as for those who pro- \ntect one: higher than that life and truth there \nis no life or truth!" \n\nThere was one pilgrim, a quiet pockmarked \nlittle woman of fifty called Theodosia, who for \nover thirty years had gone about barefoot and \nworn heavy chains. Princess Mary was particu- \nlarly fond of her. Once, when in a room with a \nlamp dimly lit before the icon Theodosia was \ntalking of her life, the thought that Theodosia \nalone had found the true path of life suddenly \ncame to Princess Mary with such force that she \nresolved to become a pilgrim herself. When \nTheodosia had gone to sleep Princess Mary \nthought about this for a long time, and at last \nmade up her mind that, strange as it might \nseem, she must go on a pilgrimage. She dis- \nclosed this thought to no one but to her con- \nfessor, Father Akfnfi, the monk, and he ap- \nproved of her intention. Under guise of a pres- \nent for the pilgrims, Princess Mary prepared \na pilgrim's complete costume for herself: a \ncoarse smock, bast shoes, a rough coat, and a \nblack kerchief. Often, approaching the chest \nof drawers containing this secret treasure, Prin- \n\n\n\ncess Mary paused, uncertain whether the time \nhad not already come to put her project into \nexecution. \n\nOften, listening to the pilgrims' tales, she \nwas so stimulated by their simple speech, me- \nchanical to them but to her so full of deep \nmeaning, that several times she was on the \npoint of abandoning everything and running \naway from home. In imagination she already \npictured herself by Theodosia's side, dressed in \ncoarse rags, walking with a staff, a wallet on \nher back, along the dusty road, directing her \nwanderings from one saint's shrine to another, \nfree from envy, earthly love, or desire, and \nreaching at last the place where there is no \nmore sorrow or sighing, but eternal joy and \nbliss. \n\n"I shall come to a place and pray there, and \nbefore having time to get used to it or getting \nto love it, I shall go farther. I will go on till my \nlegs fail, and I'll lie down and die somewhere, \nand shall at last reach that eternal, quiet ha- \nven, where there is neither sorrow nor sighing \n..." thought Princess Mary. \n\nBut afterwards, when she saw her father and \nespecially little Koko (Nicholas), her resolve \nweakened. She wept quietly, and felt that she \nwas a sinner who loved her father and little \nnephew more than God. \n\n\n\nBook Seven: 1810-11 \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I \n\nTHE BIBLE LEGEND tells us that the absence of \nlaboridleness was a condition of the first \nman's blessedness before the Fall. Fallen man \nhas retained a love of idleness, but the curse \nweighs on the race not only because we have to \nseek our bread in the sweat of our brows, but \nbecause our moral nature is such that we can- \nnot be both idle and at ease. An inner voice \ntells us we are in the wrong if we are idle. If \nman could find a state in which he felt that \nthough idle he was fulfilling his duty, he would \nhave found one of the conditions of man's \nprimitive blessedness. And such a state of obli- \ngatory and irreproachable idleness is the lot of \na whole class the military. The chief attrac- \ntion of military service has consisted and will \nconsist in this compulsory and irreproachable \nidleness. \n\nNicholas Rost6v experienced this blissful \ncondition to the full when, after 1807, he con- \ntinued to serve in the Pdvlograd regiment, in \nwhich he already commanded the squadron he \nhad taken over from Denfsov. \n\nRost6v had become a bluff, good-natured \nfellow, whom his Moscow acquaintances would \nhave considered rather bad form, but who was \nliked and respected by his comrades, subordi- \nnates, and superiors, and was well contented \nwith his life. Of late, in 1809, he found in let- \nters from home more frequent complaints from \nhis mother that their affairs were falling into \ngreater and greater disorder, and that it was \ntime for him to come back to gladden and com- \nfort his old parents. \n\nReading these letters, Nicholas felt a dread \nof their wanting to take him away from sur- \nroundings in which, protected from all the en- \ntanglements of life, he was living so calmly and \nquietly. He felt that sooner or later he would \nhave to re-enter that whirlpool of life, with its \nembarrassments and affairs to be straightened \nout, its accounts with stewards, quarrels, and \nintrigues, its ties, society, and with S6nya's love \nand his promise to her. It was all dreadfully \n\n\n\ndifficult and complicated; and he replied to his \nmother in cold, formal letters in French, begin- \nning: "My dear Mamma," and ending: "Your \nobedient son," which said nothing of when he \nwould return. In 1810 he received letters from \nhis parents, in which they told him of Natasha's \nengagement to Bolk6nski, and that the wed- \nding would be in a year's time because the old \nprince made difficulties. This letter grieved \nand mortified Nicholas. In the first place he \nwas sorry that Natdsha, for whom he cared \nmore than for anyone else in the family, should \nbe lost to the home; and secondly, from his \nhussar point of view, he regretted not to have \nbeen there to show that fellow Bolk6nski that \nconnection with him was no such great honor \nafter all, and that if he loved Natdsha he might \ndispense with permission from his dotard fa- \nther. For a moment he hesitated whether he \nshould not apply for leave in order to see Na- \ntdsha before she was married, but then came \nthe maneuvers, and considerations about S6n- \nya and about the confusion of their affairs, and \nNicholas again put it off. But in the spring of \nthat year, he received a letter from his mother, \nwritten without his father's knowledge, and \nthat letter persuaded him to return. She wrote \nthat if he did not come and take matters in \nhand, their whole property would be sold by \nauction and they would all have to go begging. \nThe count was so weak, and trusted Mftenka \nso much, and was so good-natured, that every- \nbody took advantage of him and things were \ngoing from bad to worse. "For God's sake, I \nimplore you, come at once if you do not wish \nto make me and the whole family wretched," \nwrote the countess. \n\nThis letter touched Nicholas. He had that \ncommon sense of a matter-of-fact man which \nshowed him what he ought to do. \n\nThe right thing now was, if not to retire \nfrom the service, at any rate to go home on \nleave. Why he had to go he did not know; but \nafter his after-dinner nap he gave orders to \nsaddle Mars, an extremely vicious gray stallion, \n\n\n\n*75 \n\n\n\n276 \n\nthat had not been ridden for a long time, and \nwhen he returned with the horse all in a lather, \nhe informed Lavriishka (Denfsov's servant \nwho had remained with him) and his comrades \nwho turned up in the evening that he was ap- \nplying for leave and was going home. Difficult \nand strange as it was for him to reflect that he \nwould go away without having heard from the \nstaff and this interested him extremely \nwhether he was promoted to a captaincy or \nwould receive the Order of St. Anne for the \nlast maneuvers; strange as it was to think that \nhe would go away without having sold his three \nroans to the Polish Count Golukhovski, who \nwas bargaining for the horses Rost6v had \nbetted he would sell for two thousand rubles; \nincomprehensible as it seemed that the ball \nthe hussars were giving in honor of the Polish \nMademoiselle Przazdziecka (out of rivalry to \nthe Uhlans who had given one in honor of \ntheir Polish Mademoiselle Borzozowska) would \ntake place without him he knew he must go \naway from this good, bright world to some- \nwhere where everything was stupid and con- \nfused. A week later he obtained his leave. His \nhussar comrades not only those of his own \nregiment, but the whole brigade gave Rostov \na dinner to which the subscription was fifteen \nrubles a head, and at which there were two \nbands and two choirs of singers. Rost6v danced \nthe Trepak with Major Basov; the tipsy officers \ntossed, embraced, and dropped RostcW; the \nsoldiers of the third squadron tossed him too, \nand shouted "hurrah!" and then they put him \nin his sleigh and escorted him as far as the first \npost station. \n\nDuring the first half of the journey from \nKremenchug to Kiev all Rost6v's thoughts, as \nis usual in such cases, were behind him, with the \nsquadron; but when he had gone more than \nhalfway he began to forget his three roans and \nDozhoyve*yko, his quartermaster, and to won- \nder anxiously how things would be at Otrad- \nnoe and what he would find there. Thoughts \nof home grew stronger the nearer he approached \nit far stronger, as though this feeling of his \nwas subject to the law by which the force of at- \ntraction is in inverse proportion to the square \nof the distance. At the last post station before \nOtrddnoe he gave the driver a three-ruble tip, \nand on arriving he ran breathlessly, like a boy, \nup the steps of his home. \n\nAfter the rapture of meeting, and after that \nodd feeling of unsatisfied expectation the \nfeeling that "everything is just the same, so \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\ndown in his old home world. His father and \nmother were much the same, only a little older. \nWhat was new in them was a certain uneasi- \nness and occasional discord, which there used \nnot to be, and which, as Nicholas soon found \nout, was due to the bad state of their affairs. \nS6nya was nearly twenty; she had stopped \ngrowing prettier and promised nothing more \nthan she was already, but that was enough. \nShe exhaled happiness and love from the time \nNicholas returned, and the faithful, unalter- \nable love of this girl had a gladdening effect on \nhirn. P(kya and Natasha surprised Nicholas \nmost. Pc"tya was a big handsome boy of thir- \nteen, merry, witty, and mischievous, with a \nvoice that was already breaking. As for Nata- \nsha, for a long while Nicholas wondered and \nlaughed whenever he looked at her. \n\n"You're not the same at all," he said. \n\n"How? Am I uglier?" \n\n"On the contrary, but what dignityl A prin- \ncess!" he whispered to her. \n\n"Yes,. yes, yes!" cried Natasha, joyfully. \n\nShe told him about her romance with Prince \nAndrew and of his visit to Otrddnoe and \nshowed him his last letter. \n\n"Well, are you glad?" Natdsha asked. "I am \nso tranquil and happy now." \n\n"Very glad," answered Nicholas. "He is an \n\nexcellent fellow And are you very much in \n\nlove?" \n\n"How shall I put it?" replied Natdsha. "I \nwas in love with Boris, with my teacher, and \nwith Denisov, but this is quite different. I feel \nat peace and settled. I know that no better \nman than he exists, and I am calm and con- \ntented now. Not at all as before." \n\nNicholas expressed his disapproval of the \npostponement of the marriage for a year; but \nNatdsha attacked her brother with exaspera- \ntion, proving to him that it could not be oth- \nerwise, and that it would be a bad thing to en- \nter a family against the father's will, and that \nshe herself wished it so. \n\n"You don't at all understand/' she said. \n\nNicholas was silent and agreed with her. \n\nHer brother often wondered as he looked at \nher. She did not seem at all like a girl in love \nand parted from her affianced husband. She \nwas even-tempered and calm and quite as \ncheerful as of old. This amazed Nicholas and \neven made him regard Bolk6nski's courtship \nskeptically. He could not believe that her \nfate was sealed, especially as he had not seen \nher with Prince Andrew. It always seemed- \n\n\n\nwhy did I hurry?" Nicholas began to settle to him that there was something not quite \n\n\n\nright about this intended marriage. \n\n"Why this delay? Why no betrothal?" he \nthought. Once, when he had touched on this \ntopic with his mother, he discovered, to his sur- \nprise and somewhat to his satisfaction, that in \nthe depth of her soul she too had doubts about \nthis marriage. \n\n"You see he writes," said she, showing her \nson a letter of Prince Andrew's, with that la- \ntent grudge a mother always has in regard to a \ndaughter's future married happiness, "he writes \nthat he won't come before December. What \ncan be keeping him? Illness, probably! His \nhealth is very delicate. Don't tell Natdsha. And \ndon't attach importance to her being so bright: \nthat's because she's living through the last days \nof her girlhood, but I know what she is like \nevery time we receive a letter from him! How- \never, God grant that everything turns out \nwell!" (She always ended with these words.) \n"He is an excellent man!" \n\nCHAPTER II \n\nAFTER REACHING HOME Nicholas was at first \nserious and even dull. He was worried by the \nimpending necessity of interferinginthestupid \nbusiness matters for which his mother had \ncalled him home. To throw off this burden as \nquickly as possible, on the third day after his \narrival he went, angry and scowling and with- \nout answering questions as to where he was \ngoing, to Mitenka's lodge and demanded an \naccount of everything. But what an account of \neverything might be Nicholas knew even less \nthan the frightened and bewildered Mitenka. \nThe conversation and the examination of the \naccounts with Mitenka did not last long. The \nvillage elder, a peasant delegate, and the vil- \nlage clerk, who were waiting in the passage, \nheard with fear and delight first the young \ncount's voice roaring and snapping and rising \nlouder and louder, and then words of abuse, \ndreadful words, ejaculated one after the other. \n\n"Robber! . . . Ungrateful wretch! . . .I'll hack \nthe dog to pieces! I'm not my father! . . . Rob- \nbing us! . . ." and so on. \n\nThen with no less fear and delight they saw \nhow the young count, red in the face and with \nbloodshot eyes, dragged MUenka out by the \nscruff of the neck and applied his foot and \nknee to him behind with great agility at con- \nvenient moments between the words, shout- \ning, "Be off! Never let me see your face here \nagain, you villain!" \n\nMitenka flew headlong down the six steps \nand ran away into the shrubbery. (This shrub- \n\n\n\nBOOK SEVEN 277 \n\nbery was a well-known haven of refuge for cul- \n\n\n\nprits at Otrddnoe. Mftenka himself, returning \ntipsy from the town, used to hide there, and \nmany of the residents at Otrddnoe, hiding from \nMitenka, knew of its protective qualities.) \n\nMf tenka's wife and sisters-in-law thrust their \nheads and frightened faces out of the door of a \nroom where a bright samovar was boiling and \nwhere the steward's high bedstead stood with \nits patchwork quilt. \n\nThe young count paid no heed to them, but, \nbreathing hard, passed by with resolute strides \nand went into the house. \n\nThe countess, who heard at once from the \nmaids what had happened at the lodge, was \ncalmed by the thought that now their affairs \nwould certainly improve, but on the other \nhand felt anxious as to the effect this excite- \nment might have on her son. She went several \ntimes to his door on tiptoe and listened, as he \nlighted one pipe after another. \n\nNext day the old count called his son aside \nand, with an embarrassed smile, said to him: \n\n"But you know, my dear boy, it's a pity you \ngot excited! Mitenka has told me all about it." \n\n"I knew," thought Nicholas, "that I should \nnever understand any thing in this crazy world." \n\n"You were angry that he had not entered \nthose 700 rubles. But they were carried for- \nwardand you did not look at the other page." \n\n"Papa, he is a blackguard and a thief! I know \nhe is! And what I have done, I have done; but, \nif you like, I won't speak to him again." \n\n"No, my dear boy" (the count, too, felt em- \nbarrassed. He knew he had mismanaged his \nwife's property and was to blame toward his \nchildren, but he did not know how to remedy \nit). "No, I beg you to attend to the business. I \nam old. I ..." \n\n"No, Papa. Forgive me if I have caused you \nunpleasantness. I understand it all less than \nyou do." \n\n"Devil take all these peasants, and money \nmatters, and carryings forward from page to \npage," he thought. "I used to understand what \na 'corner* and the stakes at cards meant, but \ncarrying forward to another page I don't un- \nderstand at all," said he to himself, and after \nthat he did not meddle in business affairs. But \nonce the countess called her son and informed \nhim that she had a promissory note from Anna \nMikhdylovna for two thousand rubles, and \nasked him what he thought of doing with it. \n\n"This," answered Nicholas. "You say it rests \nwith me. Well, I don't like Anna Mikhdylov- \nna and I don't like Boris, but they were our \n\n\n\n278 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nfriends and poor. Well then, this I" and he tore \nup the note, and by so doing caused the old \ncountess to weep tears of joy. After that, young \nRost6v took no further part in any business af- \nfairs, but devoted himself with passionate en- \nthusiasm to what was to him a new pursuit \nthe chase for which his father kept a large \nestablishment. \n\nCHAPTER III \n\nTHE WEATHER was already growing wintry and \nmorning frosts congealed an earth saturated \nby autumn rains. The verdure had thickened \nand its bright green stood out sharply against \nthe brownish strips of winter rye trodden down \nby the cattle, and against the pale-yellow stub- \nble of the spring sowing and the reddish strips \nof buckwheat. The wooded ravines and the \ncopses, which at the end of August had still \nbeen green islands amid black fields and stub- \nble, had become golden and bright-red islands \namid the green winter rye. The hares had al- \nready half changed their summer coats, the fox \ncubs were beginning to scatter, and the young \nwolves were bigger than dogs. It was the best \ntime of the year for the chase. The hounds of \nthat ardent young sportsman Rostov had not \nmerely reached hard winter condition, but \nwere so jaded that at a meetingof the huntsmen \nit was decided to give them a three days' rest \nand then, on the sixteenth of September, to go \non a distant expedition, starting from the oak \ngrove where there was an undisturbed litter of \nwolf cubs. \n\nAll that day the hounds remained at home. \nIt was frosty and the air was sharp, but toward \nevening the sky became overcast and it began \nto thaw. On the fifteenth, when young Rost6v, \nin his dressing gown, looked out of the window, \nhe saw it was an unsurpassable morning for \nhunting: it was as if the sky were melting and \nsinking to the earth without any wind. The \nonly motion in the air was that of the dripping, \nmicroscopic particles of drizzling mist. The \nbare twigs in the garden were hung with trans- \nparent drops which fell on the freshly fallen \nleaves. The earth in the kitchen garden looked \nwet and black and glistened like poppy seed \nand at a short distance merged into the dull, \nmoist veil of mist. Nicholas went out into the \nwet and muddy porch. There was a smell of \ndecaying leaves and of dog. Milka, a black- \nspotted, broad-haunched bitch with prominent \nblack eyes, got up on seeing her master, \nstretched her hind legs, lay down like a hare, \nand then suddenly jumped up and licked him \n\n\n\nright on his nose and mustache. Another bor- \nzoi, a dog, catching sight of his master from the \ngarden path, arched his back and, rushing \nheadlong toward the porch with lifted tail, be- \ngan rubbing himself against his legs. \n\n"O-hoy!" came at that moment, that inimi- \ntable huntsman's call which unites the deepest \nbass with the shrillest tenor, and round the \ncorner came Daniel the head huntsman and \nhead kennelman, a gray, wrinkled old man \nwith hair cut straight over his forehead, Ukrain- \nian fashion, a long bent whip in his hand, and \nthat look of independence and scorn of every- \nthing that is only seen in huntsmen. He doffed \nhis Circassian cap to his master and looked at \nhim scornfully. This scorn was not offensive to \nhis master. Nicholas knew that this Daniel, dis- \ndainful of everybody and who considered him- \nself above them, was all the same his serf and \nhuntsman. \n\n"Daniel!" Nicholas said timidly, conscious \nat the sight of the weather, the hounds, and the \nhuntsman that he was being carried away by \nthat irresistible passion for sport which makes \na man forget all his previous resolutions, as a \nlover forgets in the presence of his mistress. \n\n"What orders, your excellency?" said the \nhuntsman in his deep bass, deep as a proto- \ndeacon's and hoarse with hallooing and two \nflashing black eyes gazed from under his brows \nat his master, who was silent. "Can you resist \nit?" those eyes seemed to be asking. \n\n"It's a good day, eh? For a hunt and a gallop, \neh?" asked Nicholas, scratching Mflka behind \nthe ears. \n\nDaniel did not answer, but winked instead. \n\n"I sent Uvrirka at dawn to listen," his bass \nboomed out after a minute's pause. "He says \nshe's moved them into the OtrAdnoe enclosure. \nThey were howling there." (This meant that \nthe she-wolf, about whom they both knew, had \nmoved with her cubs to the Otradnoe copse, a \nsmall place a mile and a half from the house.) \n\n"We ought to go, don't you think so?" said \nNicholas. "Come to me with Uvrka." \n\n"As you please." \n\n"Then put off feeding them." \n\n"Yes, sir." \n\nFive minutes later Daniel and Uvdrka were \nstanding in Nicholas' big study. Though Daniel \nwas not a big man, to see him in a room was \nlike seeing a horse or a bear on the floor among \nthe furniture and surroundings of human life. \nDaniel himself felt this, and as usual stood just \ninside the door, trying to speak softly and not \nmove, for fear of breaking something in the \n\n\n\nBOOK SEVEN \n\n\n\nmaster's apartment, and he hastened to say all \nthat was necessary so as to get from under that \nceiling, out into the open under the sky once \nmore. \n\nHaving finished his inquiries and extorted \nfrom Daniel an opinion that the hounds were \nfit (Daniel himself wished to go hunting), Nich- \nolas ordered the horses to be saddled. But just \nas Daniel was about to go Natdsha came in with \nrapid steps, not having done up her hair or fin- \nished dressing and with her old nurse's big \nshawl wrapped round her. Pe'tya ran in at the \nsame time. \n\n"You are going?" asked Natdsha. "I knew you \nwould! S6nya said you wouldn't go, but I knew \nthat today is the sort of day when you couldn't \nhelp going." \n\n"Yes, we are going," replied Nicholas reluc- \ntantly, for today, as he intended to hunt seri- \nously, he did not want to take Natasha and Pe't- \nya. "We are going, but only wolf hunting: it \nwould be dull for you." \n\n"You know it is my greatest pleasure," said \nNatdsha. "It's not fair; you are going by your- \nself, are having the horses saddled and said \nnothing to us about it." \n\n" 'No barrier bars a Russian's path' we'll \ngo!" shouted Pdtya. \n\n"But you can't. Mamma said you mustn't," \nsaid Nicholas to Natdsha. \n\n"Yes, I'll go. I shall certainly go," said Na- \ntdsha decisively. "Daniel, tell them to saddle \nfor us, and Michael must come with my dogs," \nshe added to the huntsman. \n\nIt seemed to Daniel irksome and improper \nto be in a room at all, but to have anything to \ndo with a young lady seemed to him impossible. \nHe cast down his eyes and hurried out as if it \nwere none of his business, careful as he went \nnot to inflict any accidental injury on the \nyoung lady. \n\nCHAPTER IV \n\nTHE OLD COUNT, who had always kept up an \nenormous hunting establishment but had now \nhanded it all completely over to his son's care, \nbeing in very good spirits on this fifteenth of \nSeptember, prepared to go out with the others. \nIn an hour's time the whole hunting party \nwas at the porch. Nicholas, with a stern and \nserious air which showed that now was no time \nfor attending to trifles, went past Natdsha and \nPtya who were trying to tell him something. \nHe had a look at all the details of the hunt, sent \na pack of hounds and huntsmen on ahead to \nfind the quarry, mounted his chestnut Done* ts, \n\n\n\nand whistling to his own leash of borzois, set \noff across the threshing ground to a field lead- \ning to the Otrddnoe wood. The old count's \nhorse, a sorrel gelding called Viflydnka, was led \nby the groom in attendance on him, while the \ncount himself was to drive in a small trap \nstraight to a spot reserved for him. \n\nThey were taking fifty-four hounds, with six \nhunt attendants and whippers-in. Besides the \nfamily, there were eight borzoi kennelmen and \nmore than forty borzois, so that, with the bor- \nzois on the leash belonging to members of the \nfamily, there were about a hundred and thirty \ndogs and twenty horsemen. \n\nEach dog knew its master and its call. Each \nman in the hunt knew his business, his place, \nand what he had to do. As soon as they had \npassed the fence they all spread out evenly and \nquietly, without noise or talk, along the road \nand field leading to the Otrddnoe covert. \n\nThe horses stepped over the field as over a \nthick carpet, now and then splashing into pud- \ndles as they crossed a road. The misty sky still \nseemed to descend evenly and imperceptibly \ntoward the earth, the air was still, warm, and \nsilent. Occasionally the whistle of a huntsman, \nthe snort of a horse, the crack of a whip, or the \nwhine of a straggling hound could be heard. \n\nWhen they had gone a little less than a mile, \nfive more riders with dogs appeared out of the \nmist, approaching the Rostovs. In front rode a \nfresh-looking, handsome old man with a large \ngray mustache. \n\n"Good morning, Uncle!" said Nicholas, when \nthe old man drew near. \n\n"That's it. Come on! ... I was sure of it," \nbegan "Uncle." (He was a distant relative of \nthe Rostovs', a man of small means, and their \nneighbor.) "I knew you wouldn't be able to re- \nsist it and it's a good thing you're going. That's \nit! Come on!" (This was "Uncle's" favorite ex- \npression.) "Take the covert at once, for my Gir- \nchik says the Ildgins are at Korniki with their \nhounds. That's it. Come on! ... They'll take \nthe cubs from under your very nose." \n\n"That's where I'm going. Shall we join up \nour packs?" asked Nicholas. \n\nThe hounds were joined into one pack, and \n"Uncle" and Nicholas rode on side by side. Na- \ntdsha, muffled up in shawls which did not hide \nher eager face and shining eyes, galloped up to \nthem. She was followed by Ptya who always \nkept close to her, by Michael, a huntsman, and \nby a groom appointed to look after her. Ptya, \nwho was laughing, whipped and pulled at his \nhorse. Natdsha sat easily and confidently on \n\n\n\n280 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nher black Ardbchik and reined him in without \neffort with a firm hand. \n\n"Uncle" looked round disapprovingly at Pe"t- \nya and Natdsha. He did not like to combine \nfrivolity with the serious business of hunting. \n\n"Good morning, Uncle! We are going too!" \nshouted Ptya. \n\n"Good morning, good morning! But don't \ngo overriding the hounds," said "Uncle" stern- \n\niy- \n\n"Nicholas, what a fine dog Trunfla is! He \nknew me," said Natdsha, referring to her favor- \nite hound. \n\n"In the first place, Trunfla is not a 'dog/ but \na harrier," thought Nicholas, and looked stern- \nly at his sister, trying to make her feel the dis- \ntance that ought to separate them at that mo- \nment. Natdsha understood it. \n\n"You mustn't think we'll be in anyone's way, \nUncle," she said. "We'll go to our places and \nwon't budge." \n\n"A good thing too, little countess," said "Un- \ncle," "only mind you don't fall off your horse," \nhe added, "becausethat's it, come on! you've \nnothing to hold on to." \n\nThe oasis of the Otrddnoe covert came in \nsight a few hundred yards off, the huntsmen \nwere already nearing it. Rostov, having finally \nsettled with "Uncle" where they should set on \nthe hounds, and having shown Natasha where \nshe was to standa spot where nothing could \npossibly run out went round above the ravine. \n\n"Well, nephew, you're going for a big wolf," \nsaid "Uncle." "Mind and don't let her slip!" \n\n"That's as may happen," answered Rost6v. \n"Karay, here!" he shouted, answering "Uncle's" \nremark by this call to his borzoi. Karay was a \nshaggy old dog with a hanging jowl, famous \nfor having tackled a big wolf unaided. They \nall took up their places. \n\nThe old count, knowing his son's ardor in \nthe hunt, hurried so as not to be late, and the \nhunstmen had not yet reached their places \nwhen Count Ilyd Rostov, cheerful, flushed, and \nwith quivering cheeks, drove up with his black \nhorses over the winter rye to the place reserved \nfor him, where a wolf might come out. Having \nstraightened his coat and fastened on his hunt- \ning knives and horn, he mounted his good, \nsleek, well-fed, and comfortable horse, Viflyan- \nka, which was turning gray, like himself. His \nhorses and trap were sent home. Count Ilyd \nRost6v, though not at heart a keen sportsman, \nknew the rulesof the hunt well, and rode to the \nbushy edge of the road where he was to stand, \narranged his reins, settled himself in the sad- \n\n\n\ndle, and, feeling that he was ready, looked \nabout with a smile. \n\nBeside him was Simon Chekmar, his person- \nal attendant, an old horseman now somewhat \nstiff in the saddle. Chekmar held in leash three \nformidable wolfhounds, who had, however, \ngrown fat like their master and his horse. Two \nwise old dogs lay down unleashed. Some hun- \ndred paces farther along the edge of the wood \nstood Mitka, the count's other groom, a daring \nhorseman and keen rider to hounds. Before the \nhunt, by old custom, the count had drunk a \nsilver cupful of mulled brandy, taken a snack, \nand washed it down with half a bottle of his \nfavorite Bordeaux. \n\nHe was somewhat flushed with the wine and \nthe drive. His eyes were rather moist and glit- \ntered more than usual, and as he sat in his sad- \ndle, wrapped up in his fur coat, he looked like \na child taken out for an outing. \n\nThe thin, hollow-cheeked Chekmar, having \ngot everything ready, kept glancing at his mas- \nter with whom he had lived on the best of terms \nfor thirty years, and understanding the mood \nhe was in expected a pleasant chat. A third \nperson rode up circumspectly through the wood \n(it was plain that he had had a lesson) and \nstopped behind the count. This person was a \ngray-bearded old man in a woman's cloak, with \na tall peaked cap on his head. He was the buf- \nfoon, who went by a woman's name, Nastdsya \nIvanovna. \n\n"Well, Nastdsya Ivdnovna!" whispered the \ncount, winking at him. "If you scare away the \nbeast, Daniel'll give it you!" \n\n"I know a thing or two myself!" said Nas- \ntdsya Ivdnovna. \n\n"Hush!" whispered the count and turned to \nSimon. "Have you seen the young countess?" \nhe asked. "Where is she?" \n\n"With young Count Peter, by the Zhdrov \nrank grass," answered Simon, smiling. "Though \nshe's a lady, she's very fond of hunting." \n\n"And you're surprised at the way she rides, \nSimon, eh?" said the count. "She's as good as \nmany a man!" \n\n"Of course! It's marvelous. So bold, so easy!" \n\n"And Nicholas? Where is he? By the Lyddov \nupland, isn't he?" \n\n"Yes, sir. He knows where to stand. He un- \nderstands the matter so well that Daniel and I \nare often quite astounded," said Simon, well \nknowing what would please his master. \n\n"Rides well, eh? And how well he looks on \nhis horse, eh?" \n\n"A perfect picture! How he chased a fox out \n\n\n\nBOOK SEVEN \n\n\n\n281 \n\n\n\nof the rank grass by the Zavarzinsk thicket the \nother day! Leaped a fearful place; what a sight \nwhen they rushed from the covert . . . the horse \nworth a thousand rubles and the rider beyond \nall price! Yes, one would have to search far to \nfind another as smart." \n\n"To search far . . ." repeated the count, evi- \ndently sorry Simon had not said more. "To \nsearch far," he said, turning back the skirt of \nhis coat to get at his snuffbox. \n\n"The other day when he came out from Mass \nin full uniform, Michael Sid6rych . . ." Simon \ndid not finish, for on the still air he had dis- \ntinctly caught the music of the hunt with only, \ntwo or three hounds giving tongue. He bent \ndown his head and listened, shaking a warn- \ning finger at his master. "They are on the scent \nof the cubs . . ." he whispered, "straight to the \nLyadov uplands." \n\nThe count, forgetting to smooth out the \nsmile on his face, looked into the distance \nstraight before him, down the narrow open \nspace, holding the snuff box in his hand but not \ntaking any. After the cry of the hounds came \nthe deep tones of the wolf call from Daniel's \nhunting horn; the pack joined the first three \nhounds and they could be heard in full cry, \nwith that peculiar lift in the note that indicates \nthat they are after a wolf. The whippers-in no \nlonger set on the hounds, but changed to the \ncry of ulyulyu, and above the others rose Dan- \niel's voice, now a deep bass, now piercingly \nshrill. His voice seemed to fill the whole wood \nand carried far beyond out into the open field. \n\nAfter listening a few moments in silence, the \ncount and his attendant convinced themselves \nthat the hounds had separated into two packs: \nthe sound of the larger pack, eagerly giving \ntongue, began to die away in the distance, the \nother pack rushed by the wood past the count, \nand it was with this that Daniel's voice was \nheard calling ulyulyu. The sounds of both \npacks mingled and broke apart again, but both \nwere becoming more distant. \n\nSimon sighed and stooped to straighten the \nleash a young borzoi had entangled; the count \ntoo sighed and, noticing the snuffbox in his \nhand, opened it and took a pinch. "Backl" \ncried Simon to a borzoi that was pushing for- \nward out of the wood. The count started and \ndropped the snuffbox. Nastasya Ivanovna dis- \nmounted to pick it up. The count and Simon \nwere looking at him. \n\nThen, unexpectedly, as often happens, the \nsound of the hunt suddenly approached, as if \nthe hounds in full cry and Daniel ulyulyuing \n\n\n\nwere just in front of them. \n\nThe count turned and saw on his right Mit- \nka staring at him with eyes starting out of his \nhead, raising his cap and pointing before him \nto the other side. \n\n"Look out!" he shouted, in a voice plainly \nshowing that he had long fretted to utter that \nword, and letting the borzois slip he galloped \ntoward the count. \n\nThe count and Simon galloped out of the \nwood and saw on their left a wolf which, softly \nswaying from side to side, was coming at a \nquiet lope farther to the left to the very place \nwhere they were standing. The angry borzois \nwhined and getting free of the leash rushed \npast the horses' feet at the wolf. \n\nThe wolf paused, turned its heavy forehead \ntoward the dogs awkwardly, like a man suffer- \ning from the quinsy, and, still slightly swaying \nfrom side to side, gave a couple of leaps and \nwith a swish of its tail disappeared into the \nskirt of the wood. At the same instant, with a \ncry like a wail, first one hound, then another, \nand then another, sprang helter-skelter from \nthe wood opposite and the whole pack rushed \nacross the field toward the very spot where the \nwolf had disappeared. The hazel bushes parted \nbehind the hounds and Daniel's chestnut horse \nappeared, dark with sweat. On its long back \nsat Daniel, hunched forward, capless, his di- \nsheveled gray hair hanging over his flushed, \nperspiring face. \n\n"Ulyulyulyu! ulyulyu! . . ." he cried. When \nhe caught sight of the count his eyes flashed \nlightning. \n\n"Blast you! "he shouted, holding up his whip \nthreateningly at the count. \n\n"You've let the wolf go! . . .What sportsmen I" \nand as if scorning to say more to the frightened \nand shamefaced count, he lashed the heaving \nflanks of his sweating chestnut gelding with all \nthe anger the count had aroused and flew off \nafter the hounds. The count, like a punished \nschoolboy, looked round, trying by a smile to \nwin Simon'ssympathyforhis plight. But Simon \nwas no longer there. He was galloping round \nby the bushes while the field was coming up \non both sides, all trying to head the wolf, but \nit vanished into the wood before they could do \nso. \n\nCHAPTER V \n\nNICHOLAS ROSTOV meanwhile remained at his \npost, waiting for the wolf. By the way the hunt \napproached and receded, by the cries of the \ndogs whose notes were familiar to him, by the \n\n\n\n282 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nway the voices of the huntsmen approached, \nreceded, and rose, he realized what was hap- \npening at the copse. He knew that young and \nold wolves were there, that the hounds had \nseparated into two packs, that somewhere a \nwolf was being chased, and that something had \ngone wrong. He expected the wolf to come his \nway any moment. He made thousands of dif- \nferent conjectures as to where and from what \nside the beast would come and how he would \nset upon it. Hope alternated with despair. Sev- \neral times he addressed a prayer to God that \nthe wolf should come his way. He prayed with \nthat passionate and shame-faced feeling with \nwhich men pray at moments of great excite- \nment arising from trivial causes. "What would \nit be to Thee to do this for me?" he said to \nGod. "I know Thou art great, and that it is a \nsin to ask this of Thee, but for God's sake do \nlet the old wolf come my way and let Karay \nspring at it in sight of 'Uncle' who is watch- \ning from over there and seize it by the throat \nin a death grip!" A thousand times during that \nhalf-hour Rost6v cast eager and restless glances \nover the edge of the wood, with the two scrag- \ngy oaks rising above the aspen undergrowth \nand the gully with its water-worn side and \n"Uncle's" cap just visible above the bush on his \nright. \n\n"No, I shan't have such luck," thought Ros- \nt6v, "yet what wouldn't it be worth! It is not to \nbe! Everywhere, at cards and in war, I am al- \nways unlucky." Memories of Austerlitz and of \nD61okhov flashed rapidly and clearly through \nhis mind. "Only once in my life to get an old \nwolf, I want only that!" thought he, straining \neyes and ears and looking to the left and then \nto the right and listening to the slightest vari- \nation of note in the cries of the dogs. \n\nAgain he looked to the right and saw some- \nthing running toward him across the deserted \nfield. "No, it can't be!" thought Rost6v, tak- \ning a deep breath, as a man does at the coming \nof something long hoped for. The height of \nhappiness was reached and so simply, with- \nout warning, or noise, or display, that Rost6v \ncould not believe his eyes and remained in \ndoubt for over a second. The wolf ran for- \nward and jumped heavily over a gully that \nlay in her path. She was an old animal with a \ngray back and big reddish belly. She ran with- \nout hurry, evidently feeling sure that no one \nsaw her. Rost6v, holding his breath, looked \nround at the borzois. They stood or lay not see- \ning the wolf or understanding the situation. \nOld Karay had turned his head and was angri- \n\n\n\nly searching for fleas, baring his yellow teeth \nand snapping at his hind legs. \n\n"Ulyulyulyu!" whispered Rost6v, pouting \nhis lips. The borzois jumped up, jerking the \nrings of the leashes and pricking their ears. \nKaray finished scratching his hindquarters \nand, cocking his ears, got up with quivering \ntail from which tufts of matted hair hung \ndown. \n\n"Shall I loose them or not?" Nicholas asked \nhimself as the wolf approached him coming \nfrom the copse. Suddenly the wolf's whole phys- \niognomy changed: she shuddered, seeing what \nshe had probably never seen before human \neyes fixed upon her and turning her head a \nlittle toward Rost6v, she paused. \n\n"Back or forward? Eh, no matter, forward \n. . ." the wolf seemed to say to herself, and she \nmoved forward without again looking round \nand with a quiet, long, easy yet resolute lope. \n\n"Ulyulyu!" cried Nicholas, in a voice not his \nown, and of its own accord his good horse dart- \ned headlong downhill, leaping over gullies to \nhead off the wolf, and the borzois passed it, \nrunning faster still. Nicholas did not hear his \nown cry nor feel that he was galloping, nor see \nthe borzois, nor the groundover which he went: \nhe saw only the wolf, who, increasing her speed, \nbounded on in the same direction along the \nhollow. The first to come into view was Milka, \nwith her black markings and powerful quarters, \ngaining upon the wolf. Nearer and nearer . . . \nnow she was ahead of it; but the wolf turned \nits head to face her, and instead of putting on \nspeed as she usually did Mflka suddenly raised \nher tail and stiffened her forelegs. \n\n"Ulyulyulyulyu!" shouted Nicholas. \n\nThe reddish Lyubfm rushed forward from \nbehind Milka, sprang impetuously at the wolf, \nand seized it by its hindquarters, but immedi- \nately jumped aside in terror. The wolf crouched, \ngnashed her teeth, and again rose and bound- \ned forward, followed at the distance of a couple \nof feet by all the borzois, who did not get any \ncloser to her. \n\n"She'll get away! No, it's impossible! "thought \nNicholas, still shouting with a hoarse voice. \n\n"Karay, ulyulyu! . . ." he shouted, looking \nround for the old borzoi who was now his only \nhope. Karay, with all the strength age had left \nhim, stretched himself to the utmost and, watch- \ning the wolf, galloped heavily aside to intercept \nit. But the quickness of the wolf's lope and the \nborzoi's slower pace made it plain that Karay \nhad miscalculated. Nicholas could already see \nnot far in front of him the wood where the wolf \n\n\n\nBOOK SEVEN \n\n\n\n283 \n\n\n\nwould certainly escape should she reach it. But, \ncoining toward him, he saw hounds and a hunts- \nman galloping almost straight at the wolf. \nThere was still hope. A long, yellowish young \nborzoi, one Nicholas did not know, from an- \nother leash, rushed impetuously at the wolf \nfrom in front and almost knocked her over. But \nthe wolf jumped up more quickly than anyone \ncould have expected and, gnashing her teeth, \nflew at the yellowish borzoi, which, with a \npiercing yelp, fell with its head on the ground, \nbleeding from a gash in its side. \n\n"Karay? Old fellow! . . ." wailed Nicholas. \n\nThanks to the delay caused by this crossing \nof the wolf's path, the old dog with its felted \nhair hanging from its thigh was within five \npaces of it. As if aware of her danger, the wolf \nturned her eyes on Karay, tucked her tail yet \nfurther between her legs, and increased her \nspeed. But here Nicholas only saw that some- \nthing happened to Karay the borzoi was sud- \ndenly on the wolf, and they rolled together \ndown into a gully just in front of them. \n\nThat instant, when Nicholas saw the wolf \nstrugglingin thegullywith the dogs, while from \nunder them could be seen her gray hair and out- \nstretched hind leg and her frightened choking \nhead, with her ears laid back (Karay was pin- \nning her by the throat), was the happiest mo- \nment of his life. With his hand on his saddle- \nbow, he was ready to dismount and stab the \nwolf, when she suddenly thrust her head up \nfrom among that mass of dogs, and then her \nforepaws were on the edge of the gully. She \nclicked her teeth (Karay no longer had her by \nthe throat), leaped with a movement of her \nhind legs out of the gully, and having disen- \ngaged herself from the dogs, with tail tucked \nin again, went forward. Kardy, his hair bris- \ntling, and probably bruised or wounded, \nclimbed with difficulty out of the gully. . \n\n"Oh my God! Why?" Nicholas cried in des- \npair. \n\ni "Uncle's" huntsman was galloping from the \nother side across the wolf's path and his borzois \nonce more stopped the animal's advance. She \nwas again hemmed in. \n\nNicholas and his attendant, with "Uncle" \nand his huntsman, were all riding round the \nwolf, crying "ulyulyu!" shouting and prepar- \ning to dismount each moment that the wolf \ncrouched back, and starting forward again ev- \nery time she shook herself and moved toward \nthe wood where she would be safe. \n\nAlready, at the beginning of this chase, \nDaniel, hearing theulyulyuing, had rushed out \n\n\n\nfrom the wood. He saw Karay seize the wolf, \nand checked his horse, supposing the affair to \nbe over. But when he saw that the horsemen \ndid not dismount and that the wolf shook her- \nself and ran for safety, Daniel set his chestnut \ngalloping, not at the wolf but straight toward \nthe wood, just as Karay had run to cut the ani- \nmal off. As a result of this, he galloped up to \nthe wolf just when she had been stopped a sec- \nond time by "Uncle's" borzois. \n\nDaniel galloped up silently, holding a naked \ndagger in his left hand and thrashing the la- \nboring sides of his chestnut horse with his whip \nas if it were a flail. \n\nNicholas neither saw nor heard Daniel un- \ntil the chestnut, breathing heavily, panted past \nhim, and he heard the fall of a body and saw \nDaniel lying on the wolf's back among the dogs, \ntrying to seize her by the ears. It was evident \nto the dogs, the hunters, and to the wolf her- \nself that all was now over. The terrified wolf \npressed back her ears and tried to rise, but the \nborzois stuck to her. Daniel rose a little, took \na step, and with his whole weight, as if lying \ndown to rest, fell on the wolf, seizing her by \nthe ears. Nicholas was about to stab her, but \nDaniel whispered, "Don't! We'll gag her!" and, \nchanging his position, set his foot on the wolf's \nneck. A stick was thrust between her jaws and \nshe was fastened with a leash, as if bridled, her \nlegs were bound together, and Daniel rolled \nher over once or twice from side to side. \n\nWith happy, exhausted faces, they laid the \nold wolf, alive, on a shying and snorting horse \nand, accompanied by the dogs yelping at her, \ntook her to the place where they were all to \nmeet. The hounds had killed two of the cubs \nand the borzois three. The huntsmen assem- \nbled with their booty and their stories, and all \ncame to look at the wolf, which, with her \nbroad-browed head hanging down and the bit- \nten stick between her jaws, gazed with great \nglassy eyes at this crowd of dogs and men sur- \nrounding her. When she was touched, she jerked \nher bound legs and looked wildly yet simply at \neverybody. Old Count Rost6valso rode up and \ntouched the wolf. \n\n"Oh, what a formidable one!" said he. "A \nformidable one, eh?" he asked Daniel, who was \nstanding near. \n\n"Yes, your excellency," answered Daniel, \nquickly doffing his cap. \n\nThe count remembered the wolf he had let \nslip and his encounter with Daniel. \n\n"Ah, but you are a crusty fellow, friend!" \nsaid the count. \n\n\n\n284 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nFor sole reply Daniel gave him a shy, child- \nlike, meek, and amiable smile. \n\nCHAPTER VI \n\nTHE OLD COUNT went home, and Natdsha and \nP^tya promised to return very soon, but as it \nwas still early the hunt went farther. At mid- \nday they put the hounds into a ravine thickly \novergrown with young trees. Nicholas standing \nin a fallow field could see all his whips. \n\nFacing him lay a field of winter rye, and there \nhis own huntsman stood alone in a hollow be- \nhind a hazel bush. The hounds had scarcely \nbeen loosed before Nicholas heard one he \nknew, Volt6rn, giving tongue at intervals; oth- \ner hounds joined in, now pausing and now a- \ngain giving tongue. A moment later he heard a \ncry from the wooded ravine that a fox had been \nfound, and the whole pack, joining together, \nrushed along the ravine toward theryefield and \naway from Nicholas. \n\nHe saw the whips in their red caps galloping \nalong the edge of the ravine, he even saw the \nhounds, and was expecting a fox to show itself \nat any moment on the ryefield opposite. \n\nThe huntsman standing in the hollow moved \nand loosed his borzois, and Nicholas saw a \nqueer, short-legged red fox with a fine brush \ngoing hard across the field. The borzois bore \ndown on it. ... Now they drew close to the fox \nwhich began to dodge between the field in \nsharper and sharper curves, trailing its brush, \nwhen suddenly a strange white borzoi dashed \nin followed by a black one, and everything was \nin confusion; the borzois formed a star-shaped \nfigure, scarcely swaying their bodies and with \ntails turned away from the center of the group. \nTwo huntsmen galloped up to the dogs; one in \na red cap, the other, a stranger, in a green coat. \n\n"What's this?" thought Nicholas. "Where's \nthat huntsman from? He is not 'Uncle's' man." \n\nThe huntsmen got the fox, but stayed there \na long time without strapping it to the saddle. \nTheir horses, bridled and with high saddles, \nstood near them and there too the dogs were \nlying. The huntsmen waved their arms and \ndid something to the fox. Then from that spot \ncame the sound of a horn, with the signal agreed \non in case of a fight. \n\n"That's Ilagin's huntsman havinga row with \nour Ivdn," said Nicholas* groom. \n\nNicholas sent the man to call Natasha and \nPtya to him, and rode at a footpace to the \nplace where the whips were getting the hounds \ntogether. Several of the field galloped to the \nspot where the fight was going on. \n\n\n\nNicholas dismounted, and with Natasha and \nPe"tya, who had ridden up, stopped near the \nhounds, waiting to see how the matter would \nend. Out of the bushes came the huntsman who \nhad been fighting and rode toward his young \nmaster, with the fox tied to his crupper. While \nstill at a distance he took off his cap and tried \nto speak respectfully, but he was pale and \nbreathless and his face was angry. One of his \neyes was black, but he probably was not even \naware of it. \n\n"What has happened?" asked Nicholas. \n\n"A likely thing, killing a fox our dogs had \nhuntedl And it was my gray bitch that caught \nit! Go to law, indeed! ... He snatches at the \nfox! I gave him one with the fox. Here it is on \nmy saddle! Do you want a taste of this? . . ." \nsaid the huntsman, pointing to his dagger and \nprobably imagining himself still speaking to \nhis foe. \n\nNicholas, not stopping to talk to the man, \nasked his sister and Petya to wait for him and \nrode to the spot where the enemy's, Ildgin's, \nhunting party was. \n\nThe victorious huntsman rode off to join the \nfield, and there, surrounded by inquiring sym- \npathizers, recounted his exploits. \n\nThe facts were that Ildgin, with whom the \nRostovs had a quarrel and were at law, hunted \nover places that belonged bv custom to the Ros- \ntovs, and had now, as if purposely, sent his men \nto the very woods the Rost6vs were hunting \nand let his man snatch a fox their dogs had \nchased. \n\nNicholas, though he had never seen Ildgin, \nwith his usual absence of moderation in judg- \nment, hated him cordially from reports of his \narbitrariness and violence, and regarded him \nas his bitterest foe. He rode in angry agitation \ntoward him, firmly grasping his whip and ful- \nly prepared to take the most resolute and des- \nperate steps to punish his enemy. \n\nHardly had he passed an angle of the wood \nbefore a stout gentleman in a beaver cap came \nriding toward him on a handsome raven-black \nhorse, accompanied by two hunt servants. \n\nInstead of an enemy, Nicholas found in Ild- \ngin a stately and courteous gentleman who was \nparticularly anxious to make the young count's \nacquaintance. Having ridden up to Nicholas, \nIldgin raised his beaver cap and said he much \nregretted what had occurred and would have \nthe man punished who had allowed himself to \nseize a fox hunted by someone else's borzois. \nHe hoped to become better acquainted with \nthe count and invited him to draw his covert. \n\n\n\nBOOK SEVEN \n\n\n\n285 \n\n\n\nNatdsha, afraid that her brother would do \nsomething dreadful, had followed him in some \nexcitement. Seeing the enemies exchanging \nfriendly greetings, she rode up to them. Ilagin \nlifted his beaver cap still higher to Natasha \nand said, with a pleasant smile, that the young \ncountess resembled Diana in her passion for \nthe chase as well as in her beauty, of which he \nhad heard much. \n\nTo expiate his huntsman's offense, Ilagin \npressed the Rost6vs to come to an upland of \nhis about a mile away which he usually kept for \nhimself and which, he said, swarmed with hares. \nNicholas agreed, and the hunt, now doubled, \nmoved on. \n\nThe way to Ilagin's upland was across the \nfields. The hunt servants fell into line. The \nmasters rode together. "Uncle," Rost6v, and \nIlagin kept stealthily glancing at one another's \ndogs, trying not to be observed by their com- \npanions and searching uneasily for rivals to \ntheir own borzois. \n\nRost6v was particularly struck by the beauty \nof a small, pure-bred, red-spotted bitch on Il- \nagin's leash, slender but with muscles like steel, \na delicate muzzle, and prominent black eyes. \nHe had heard of the swiftness of Ilagin's bor- \nzois, and in that beautiful bitch saw a rival to \nhis own Milka. \n\nIn the middle of a sober conversation begun \nby Ilagin about the year's harvest, Nicholas \npointed to the red-spotted bitch. \n\n"A fine little bitch, that!" said he in a care- \nless tone. "Is she swift?" \n\n"That one? Yes, she's a good dog, gets what \nshe's after," answered Ilagin indifferently, of \nthe red-spotted bitch Erza, for which, a year \nbefore, he had given a neighbor three families \nof house serfs. "So in your parts, too, the har- \nvest is nothing to boast of, Count?" he went \non, continuing the conversation they had be- \ngun. And considering it polite to return the \nyoung count's compliment, Ilagin looked at \nhis borzois and picked out Mflka who attract- \ned his attention by her breadth. "That black- \nspotted one of yours is finewell shaped!" \nsaid he. \n\n"Yes, she's fast enough," replied Nicholas, \nand thought: "If only a full-grown hare would \ncross the field now I'd show you what sort of \nborzoi she is, M and turning to his groom, he \nsaid he would give a ruble to anyone who found \na hare. \n\n"I don't understand," continued Ilagin, \n"how some sportsmen can be so jealous about \ngame and dogs. For myself, I can tell you, \n\n\n\nCount, I enjoy riding in company such as this \n. . . what could be better?" (he again raised his \ncap to Natasha) "but as for counting skins \nand what one takes, I don't care about that." \n\n"Of course not!" \n\n"Or being upset because someone else's bor- \nzoi and not mine catches something. All I care \nabout is to enjoy seeing the chase, is it not so, \nCount? For I consider that . . ." \n\n"A-tu!" came the long-drawn cry of one of \nthe borzoi whippers-in, who had halted. He \nstood on a knoll in the stubble, holding his \nwhip aloft, and again repeated his long-drawn \ncry, "A-tu!" (This call and the uplifted whip \nmeant that he saw a sitting hare.) \n\n"Ah, he has found one, I think," said Ilagin \ncarelessly. "Well, let us course it, Count." \n\n"Yes, we must ride up. . . . Shall we both \ncourse it?" answered Nicholas, seeing in Erzd \nand "Uncle's" red Rugay two rivals he had nev- \ner yet had a chance of pitting against his own \nborzois. "And suppose they outdo my Milka at \nonce!" he thought as he rode with "Uncle" and \nIldgin toward the hare. \n\n"A full-grown one?" asked Ilagin as he ap- \nproached the whip who had sighted the hare \nand not without agitation he looked round and \nwhistled to Erza. \n\n"And you, Michael Nikan6rovich?" he said, \naddressing "Uncle." \n\nThe latter was riding with a sullen expres- \nsion on his face. \n\n"How can I join in? Why, you've given a vil- \nlage for each of your borzois! That's it, come \non! Yours are worth thousands. Try yours a- \ngainst one another, you two, and I'll look on!" \n\n"Rugay, hey, hey!" he shouted. "Rugiyush- \nkal" he added, involuntarily by this diminutive \nexpressing his affection and the hopes he placed \non this red borzoi. Natasha saw and felt the agi- \ntation the two elderly men and her brother \nwere trying to conceal, and was herself excited \nby it. \n\nThe huntsman stood halfway up the knoll \nholding up his whip and the gentlefolk rode \nup to him at a footpace; the hounds that were \nfar off on the horizon turned away from the \nhare, and the whips, but not the gentlefolk, al- \nso moved away. All were moving slowly and \nsedately. \n\n"How is it pointing?" asked Nicholas, rid- \ning a hundred paces toward the whip who had \nsighted the hare. \n\nBut before the whip could reply, the hare, \nscenting the frost coming next morning, was \nunable to rest and leaped up. The pack on \n\n\n\n286 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nleash rushed downhill in full cry after the hare, \nand from all sides the borzois that were not \non leash darted after the hounds and the hare. \nAll the hunt, who had been moving slowly, \nshouted, "Stop!" calling in the hounds, while \nthe borzoi whips, with a cry of "A-tu!" galloped \nacross the field, setting the borzois on the hare. \nThe tranquil Ildgin, Nicholas, Natdsha, and \n"Uncle" flew, reckless of where and how they \nwent, seeing only the borzois and the hare and \nfearing only to lose sight even for an instant of \nthe chase. The hare they had started was a \nstrong and swift one. When he jumped up he \ndid not run at once, but pricked his ears listen- \ning to the shouting and trampling that resound- \ned from all sides at once. He took a dozen \nbounds, not very quickly, letting the borzois \ngain on him, and, finally having chosen his di- \nrection and realized his danger, laid back his \nears and rushed off headlong. He had been ly- \ning in the stubble, but in front of him was the \nautumn sowing where the ground was soft. \nThe two borzois of the huntsman who had \nsighted him, having been the nearest, were the \nfirst to see and pursue him, but they had not \ngone far before login's red-spotted Erzd passed \nthem, got within a length, flew at the hare with \nterrible swiftness aiming at his scut, and, think- \ning she had seized him, rolled over like a ball. \nThe hare arched his back and bounded off yet \nmore swiftly. From behind Erzd rushed the \nbroad-haunched, black-spotted Milka and be- \ngan rapidly gaining on the hare. \n\n"Mildshka, dear!" rose Nicholas* trium- \nphant cry. It looked as if Milka would immedi- \nately pounce on the hare, but she overtook him \nand flew past. The hare had squatted. Again \nthe beautiful Erzd reached him, but when close \nto the hare's scut paused as if measuring the \ndistance, so as not to make a mistake this time \nbut seize his hind leg. \n\n"Erzd, darling!" Ildgin wailed in a voice un- \nlike his own. Erza did not hearken to his ap- \npeal. At the very moment when she would have \nseized her prey, the hare moved and darted \nalong the balk between the winter rye and the \nstubble. Again Erza and Mflka were abreast, \nrunning like a pair of carriage horses, and be- \ngan to overtake the hare, but it was easier for \nthe hare to run on the balk and the borzois did \nnot overtake him so quickly. \n\n"Rugay, Rugdyushka! That's it, come on!" \ncame a third voice just then, and "Uncle's" red \nborzoi, straining and curving its back, caught \nup with the two foremost borzois, pushed \nahead of them regardless of the terrible strain, \n\n\n\nput on speed close to the hare, knocked it off \nthe balk onto the ryefield, again put on speed \nstill more viciously, sinking to his knees in the \nmuddy field, and all one could see was how, \nmuddying his back, he rolled over with the \nhare. A ring of borzois surrounded him. A mo- \nment later everyone had drawn up round the \ncrowd of dogs. Only the delighted "Uncle" dis- \nmounted, and cut off a pad, shaking the hare \nfor the blood to drip off, and anxiously glanc- \ning round with restless eyes while his arms \nand legs twitched. He spoke without himself \nknowing whom to or what about. "That's it, \ncome on! That's a dog! . . . There, it has beat- \nen them all, the thousand-ruble as well as the \none-ruble borzois. That's it, come on!" said he, \npanting and looking wrathfully around as if \nhe were abusing someone, as if they were all \nhis enemies and had insulted him, and only \nnow had he at last succeeded in justifying him- \nself. "There are your thousand-ruble ones. . . . \nThat's it, come on! . . ." \n\n"Rugay, here's a pad for you I "he said, throw- \ning down the hare's muddy pad. "You've de- \nserved it, that's it, come on!" \n\n"She'd tired herself out, she'd run it down \nthree times by herself," said Nicholas, also not \nlistening to anyone and regardless of whether \nhe were heard or not. \n\n"But what is there in running across it like \nthat?" said Ilagin's groom. \n\n"Once she had missed it and turned it away, \nany mongrel could take it," ILigin was saying \nat the same time, breathless from his gallop and \nhis excitement. At the same moment Nauisha, \nwithout drawing breath, screamed joyously, ec- \nstatically, and so piercingly that it set every- \none's ear tingling. By that shriek she expressed \nwhat the others expressed by all talkingat once, \nand it was so strange that she must herself have \nbeen ashamed of so wild a cry and everyone else \nwould have been amazed at it at any other time. \n"Uncle" himself twisted up the hare, threw it \nneatly and smartly across his horse's back as if \nby that gesture he meant to rebuke everybody, \nand, with an air of not wishing to speak to any- \none, mounted his bay and rode off. The others \nall followed, dispirited and shamefaced, and \nonly much later were they able to regain their \nformer affectation of indifference. For a long \ntime they continued to look at red Rugay who, \nhis arched back spattered with mud and clank- \ning the ring of his leash, walked along just be- \nhind "Uncle's" horse with the serene air of a \nconqueror. \n\n"Well, I am like any other dog as long as it's \n\n\n\nBOOK SEVEN \n\n\n\n287 \n\n\n\nnot a question of coursing. But when it is, then \nlook out!" his appearance seem to Nicholas to \nbe saying. \n\nWhen, much later, "Uncle" rode up to Nich- \nolas and began talking to him, he felt flattered \nthat, after what had happened, "Uncle" \ndeigned to speak to him. \n\nCHAPTER VII \n\nTOWARD EVENING Ilagin took leave of Nicholas, \nwho found that they were so far from home \nthat he accepted "Uncle's" offer that the hunt- \ning party should spend the night in his little \nvillage of Mikhaylovna. \n\n"And if you put up at my house that will be \nbetter stilL That's it, come onl" said "Uncle." \n"You see it's damp weather, and you could \nrest, and the little countess could be driven \nhome in a trap." \n\n"Uncle's" offer was accepted. A huntsman \nwas sent to Otradnoe for a trap, while Nicho- \nlas rode with Natdsha and Ptya to "Uncle's" \nhouse. \n\nSome five male domestic serfs, big and little, \nrushed out to the front porch to meet their \nmaster. A score of women serfs, old and young, \nas well as children, popped out from the back \nentrance to have a look at the hunters who \nwere arriving. The presenceof Natasha a worn- \nan, a lady, and on horseback raised the curi- \nosity of the serfs to such a degree that many of \nthem came up to her, stared her in the face, \nand unabashed by her presence made remarks \nabout her as though she were some prodigy on \nshow and not a human being able to hear or \nunderstand what was said about her. \n\n"Arfnka! Look, she sits sideways! There she \nsits and her skirt dangles. . . . See, she's got a \nlittle hunting horn!" \n\n"Goodness gracious! See her knife? . . ." \n\n"Isn't she a Tartar!" \n\n"How is it you didn't go head over heels?" \nasked the boldest of all, addressing Natdsha \ndirectly. \n\n"Uncle" dismounted at the porch of his lit- \ntle wooden house which stood in the midst of \nan overgrown garden and, after a glance at \nhis retainers, shouted authoritatively that the \nsuperfluous ones should take themselves off and \nthat all necessary preparations should be made \nto receive the guests and the visitors. \n\nThe serfs all dispersed. "Uncle" lifted Na- \ntdsha off her horse and taking her hand led her \nup the rickety wooden steps of the porch. The \nhouse, with its bare, unplastered log walls, was \nnot overclean it did not seem that those liv- \n\n\n\ning in it aimed at keeping it spotless but nei- \nther was it noticeably neglected. In the entry \nthere was a smell of fresh apples, and wolf and \nfox skins hung about. \n\n"Uncle" led the visitors through the ante- \nroom into a small hall with a folding table and \nred chairs, then into the drawing room with a \nround birchwood table and a sofa, and finally \ninto his private room where there was a tattered \nsofa, a worn carpet, and portraits of Suv6rov, \nof the host's father and mother, and of himself \nin military uniform. The study smelt strongly \nof tobacco and dogs. "Uncle" asked his visitors \nto sit down and make themselves at home, and \nthen went out of the room. Rugay, his back still \nmuddy, came into the room and lay down on \nthe sofa, cleaning himself with his tongue and \nteeth. Leading from the study was a passage in \nwhich a partition with ragged curtains could \nbe seen. From behind this came women's laugh- \nter and whispers. Natasha, Nicholas, and PeHya \ntook off their wraps and sat down on the sofa. \nPC* tya, leaning on his elbow, fell asleep at once. \nNatasha and Nicholas were silent. Their faces \nglowed, they were hungry and very cheerful. \nThey looked at one another (now that the \nhunt was over and they were in the house, \nNicholas no longer considered it necessary to \nshow his manly superiority over his sister), Na- \ntdsha gave him a wink, and neither refrained \nlong from bursting into a peal of ringinglaugh- \nter even before they had a pretext ready to ac- \ncount for it. \n\nAfter a while "Uncle" came in, in a Cossack \ncoat, blue trousers, and small top boots. And \nNatasha felt that this costume, the very one \nshe had regarded with surprise and amusement \nat Otrddnoe, was just the right thing and not \nat all worse than a swallow-tail or frock coat. \n"Uncle" too was in high spirits and far from \nbeing offended by the brother's and sister's \nlaughter (it could never enter his head that \nthey might be laughing at his way of life) he \nhimself joined in the merriment. \n\n"That's right, young countess, that's it, come \non! I never saw anyone like her!" said he, offer- \ning Nicholas a pipe with a long stem and, with \na practiced motion of three fingers, taking \ndown another that had been cut short. "She's \nridden all day like a man, and is as fresh as \never!" \n\nSoon after "Uncle's" reappearance the door \nwas opened, evidently from the sound by a \nbarefooted girl, and a stout, rosy, good-looking \nwoman of about forty, with a double chin and \nfull red lips, entered carrying a large loaded \n\n\n\n288 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\ntray. With hospitable dignity and cordiality in \nher glance and in every motion, she looked at \nthe visitors and, with a pleasant smile, bowed \nrespectfully. In spite of her exceptional stout- \nness, which caused her to protrude her chest \nand stomach and throw back her head, this \nwoman (who was "Uncle's" housekeeper) trod \nvery lightly. She went to the table, set down \nthe tray, and with her plump white hands deft- \nly took from it the bottles and various hors \nd'oeuvres and dishes and arranged them on \nthe table. When she had finished, she stepped \naside and stopped at the door with a smile on \nher face. "Here I am. I am she! Now do you \nunderstand 'Uncle'?" her expression said to \nRost6v. How could one help understanding? \nNot only Nicholas, but even Natasha under- \nstood the meaning of his puckered brow and \nthe happy complacent smile that slightly puck- \nered his lips when Anfsya Fedorovna entered. \nOn the tray was a bottle of herb wine, different \nkinds of vodka, pickled mushrooms, rye cakes \nmade with buttermilk, honey in the comb, still \nmead and sparkling mead, apples, nuts (raw \nand roasted), and nut-and- honey sweets. After- \nwards she brought a freshly roasted chicken, \nham, preserves made with honey, and preserves \nmade with sugar. \n\nAll this was the fruit of Anisya Fedorovna's \nhousekeeping, gathered and prepared by her. \nThe smell and taste of it all had a smack of \nAnfsya Fedorovna herself: a savor of juiciness, \ncleanliness, whiteness, and pleasant smiles. \n\n"Take this, little Lady-Countess!" she kept \nsaying, as she offered Natdsha first one thing \nand then another. \n\nNatdsha ate of everything and thought she \nhad never seen or eaten such buttermilk cakes, \nsuch aromatic jam, such honey-and-nut sweets, \nor such a chicken anywhere. Anfsya Fedorovna \nleft the room. \n\nAfter supper, over their cherry brandy, Ros- \nt6v and "Uncle" talked of past and future \nhunts, of Rugdy and Ildgin's dogs, while Na- \ntdsha sat upright on the sofa and listened with \nsparkling eyes. She tried several times to wake \nPtya that he might eat something, but he only \nmuttered incoherent words without waking \nup. Natdsha felt so lighthearted and happy in \nthese novel surroundings that she only feared \nthe trap would come for her too soon. After a \ncasual pause, such as often occurs when re- \nceiving friends for the first time in one's own \nhouse, "Uncle," answering a thought that was \nin his visitors' minds, said: \n\n"This, you see, is how I am finishing my days. \n\n\n\n. . . Death will come. That's it, come onl Noth- \ning will remain. Then why harm anyone?" \n\n"Uncle's" face was very significant and even \nhandsome as he said this. Involuntarily Ros- \ntov recalled all the good he had heard about \nhim from his father and the neighbors. \nThroughout the whole province "Uncle" had \nthe reputation of being the most honorable \nand disinterested of cranks. They called him \nin to decide family disputes, chose him as ex- \necutor, confided secrets to him, elected him to \nbe a justice and to other posts; but he always \npersistently refused public appointments, pass- \ning the autumn and spring in the fields on his \nbay gelding, sitting at home in winter, and ly- \ning in his overgrown garden in summer. \n\n"Why don't you enter the service, Uncle?" \n\n"I did once, but gave it up. I am not fit for \nit. That's it, come on! I can't make head or tail \nof it. That's for youI haven't brains enough. \nNow, hunting is another matter that's it, come \non! Open the door, there!" he shouted. "Why \nhave you shut it?" \n\nThe door at the end of the passage led to the \nhuntsmen's room, as they called the room for \nthe hunt servants. \n\nThere was a rapid patter of bare feet, and \nan unseen hand opened the door into the hunts- \nmen's room, from which came the clear sounds \nof a balaldyka on which someone, who was evi- \ndently a master of the art, was playing. Natd- \nsha had been listening to those strains forsome \ntime and now went out into the passage to \nhear better. \n\n"That's Mftka, my coachman. ... I have got \nhim a good balaldyka. I'm fond of it," said \n"Uncle." \n\nIt was the custom for Mftka to play the bala- \nldyka in the huntsmen's room when "Uncle" \nreturned from the chase. "Uncle" was fond of \nsuch music. \n\n"How good! Really very good!" said Nich- \nolas with some unintentional superciliousness, \nas if ashamed to confess that the sounds pleased \nhim very much. \n\n"Very good?" said Natdsha reproachfully, \nnoticing her brother's tone. "Not Very good' \nit's simply delicious!" \n\nJust as "Uncle's" pickled mushrooms, honey, \nand cherry brandy had seemed to her the best \nin the world, so also that song, at that moment, \nseemed to her the acme of musical delight. \n\n"More, please, morel" cried Natdsha at the \ndoor as soon as the balaldyka ceased. Mftka \ntuned up afresh, and recommenced thrum- \nming the balaldyka to the air of My Lady, with \n\n\n\nBOOK SEVEN \n\n\n\n289 \n\n\n\ntrills and variations. "Uncle" sat listening, \nslightly smiling, with his head on one side. The \nair was repeated a hundred times. The balalay- \nka was retuned several times and the same notes \nwere thrummed again, but the listeners did \nnot grow weary of it and wished to hear it again \nand again. Anisya Fedorovna came in and \nleaned her portly person against the doorpost. \n\n"You like listening?" she said to Natasha, \nwith a smile extremely like "Uncle's." "That's \na good player of ours," she added. \n\n"He doesn't play that part rightl" said "Un- \ncle" suddenly, with an energetic gesture. "Here \nhe ought to burst out that's it, come on ! ought \nto burst out." \n\n"Do you play then?" asked Natasha. \n\n"Uncle" did not answer, but smiled. \n\n"Anisya, go and see if the strings of my gui- \ntar are all right. I haven't touched it for a long \ntime. That's it come on! I've given it up." \n\nAnfsya Fedorovna, with her light step, will- \ningly went to fulfill her errand and brought \nback the guitar. \n\nWithout looking at anyone, "Uncle" blew \nthe dust off it and, tapping the case with his \nbony fingers, tuned the guitar and settled him- \nself in his armchair. He took (he guitar a little \nabove the fingerboard, arching his left elbow \nwith a somewhat theatrical gesture, and, with \na wink at Anisya Fedorovna, struck a single \nchord, pure and sonorous, and then quietly, \nsmoothly, and confidently began playing in \nvery slow time, not My Lady, but the well- \nknown song: Came a maiden down the street. \nThe tune, played with precision^and in exact \ntime, began to thrill in the hearts of Nicholas \nand Natdsha, arousing in them the same kind \nof sober mirth as radiated from Anisya Fedo- \nrovna's whole being. Anisya Fedorovna flushed, \nand drawing her kerchief over her face went \nlaughing out of the room. "Uncle" continued \nto play correctly, carefully, with energetic firm- \nness, looking with a changed and inspired ex- \npression at the spot where Anfsya Fedorovna \nhad just stood. Something seemed to be laugh- \ning a little on one side of his face under his \ngray mustaches, especially as the song grew \nbrisker and the time quicker and when, here \nand there, as he rah his fingers over the strings, \nsomething seemed to snap. \n\n"Lovely, lovely I Go on, Uncle, go on!" \nshouted Natasha as soon as he had finished. \nShe jumped up and hugged and kissed him. \n"Nicholas, NicholasI" she said, turning to her \nbrother, as if asking him: "What is it moves me \nso?" \n\n\n\nNicholas too was greatly pleased by "Un- \ncle's" playing, and "Uncle" played the piece \nover again. Anfsya Fedorovna's smiling face re- \nappeared in the doorway and behind hers oth- \ner faces. . . . \n\nFetching water clear and sweet, \nStop, dear maiden, I entreat \n\nplayed "Uncle" once more, running his fingers \nskillfully over the strings, and then he stopped \nshort and jerked his shoulders. \n\n"Go on, Uncle dear," Nauisha wailed in an \nimploring tone as if her life depended on it. \n\n"Uncle" rose, and it was as if there were two \nmen in him: one of them smiled seriously at \nthe merry fellow, while the merry fellow struck \na naive and precise attitude preparatory to a \nfolk dance. \n\n"Now then, niece!" he exclaimed, waving to \nNatasha the hand that had just struck a chord. \n\nNatasha threw off the shawl from her shoul- \nders, ran forward to face "Uncle," and setting \nher arms akimbo also made a motion with her \nshoulders and struck an attitude. \n\nWhere, how, and when had this young count- \ness, educated by an emigree French governess, \nimbibed from the Russian air she breathed \nthat spirit and obtained that manner which \nthe pas de chdle * would, one would have sup- \nposed, long ago have effaced? But the spirit \nand the movements were those inimitable and \nun teachable Russian ones that "Uncle" had \nexpected of her. As soon as she had struck her \npose, and smiled triumphantly, proudly, and \nwith sly merriment, the fear that had at first \nseized Nicholas and the others that she might \nnot do the right thing was at an end, and they \nwere already admiring her. \n\nShe did the right thing with such precision, \nsuch complete precision, that Anisya Fedorov- \nna, who had at once handed her the handker- \nchief she needed for the dance, had tears in \nher eyes, though she laughed as she watched \nthis slim, graceful countess, reared in silks and \nvelvets and so different from herself, who yet \nwas able to understand all that was in Anfsya \nand in Anfsya's father and mother and aunt, \nand in every Russian man and woman. \n\n"Well, little countess; that's it come on!" \ncried "Uncle," with a joyous laugh, having \nfinished the dance. "Well done, niece! Now a \nfine young fellow must be found as husband \nfor you. That's it come on!" \n\n"He's chosen already," said Nicholas smil- \ning. \n\n1 The French shawl dance. \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\n"Oh?" said "Uncle" in surprise, looking in- \nquiringly at Natdsha, who nodded her head \nwith a happy smile. \n\n"And such a one!" she said. But as soon as \nshe had said it a new train of thoughts and \nfeelings arose in her. "What did Nicholas' smile \nmean when he said 'chosen already'? Is he glad \nof it or not? It is as if he thought my Bolk6nski \nwould not approve of or understand our gaiety. \nBut he would understand it all. Where is he \nnow?" she thought, and her face suddenly be- \ncame serious. But this lasted only a second. \n"Don't dare to think about it," she said to her- \nself, and sat down again smilingly beside "Un- \ncle," begging him to play something more. \n\n"Uncle" played another song and a valse; \nthen after a pause he cleared his throat and \nsang his favorite hunting song: \n\nAs 'twas growing dark last night \nFell the snow so soft and light . /. \n\n"Uncle" sang as peasants sing, with full and \nnai've conviction that the whole meaning of a \nsong lies in the words and that the tune comes \nof itself, and that apart from the words there \nis no tune, which exists only to give measure \nto the words. As a result of this the unconsid- \nered tune, like the song of a bird, was extra- \nordinarily good. Natasha was in ecstasies over \n"Uncle's" singing. She resolved to give up \nlearning the harp and to play only the guitar. \nShe asked "Uncle" for his guitar and at once \nfound the chords of the song. \n\nAfter nine o'clock two traps and three \nmounted men, who had been sent to look for \nthem, arrived to fetch Natdsha and Pdtya. The \ncount and countess did not know where they \nwere and were very anxious, said one of the \nmen. \n\nPtya was carried out like a log and laid in \nthe larger of the two traps. Natasha and Nich- \nolas got into the other. "Uncle" wrapped Na- \ntdsha up warmly and took leave of her with \nquite a new tenderness. He accompanied them \non foot as far as the bridge that could not be \ncrossed, so that they had to go round by the \nford, and he sent huntsmen to ride in front \nwith lanterns. \n\n"Good-by, dear niece," his voice called out \nof the darkness not the voice Natdsha had \nknown previously, but the one that had sung \nAs 'twas growing dark last night. \n\nIn the village through which they passed \nthere were red lights and a cheerful smell of \nsmoke. \n\n"What a darling Uncle is!" said Natdsha, \n\n\n\nwhen they had come out onto the highroad. \n\n"Yes," returned Nicholas. "You're not cold?" \n\n"No. I'm quite, quite all right. I feel so com- \nfortable!" answered Natdsha, almost perplexed \nby her feelings. They remained silent a long \nwhile. The night was dark and damp. They \ncould not see the horses, but only heard them \nsplashing through the unseen mud. \n\nWhat was passing in that receptive childlike \nsoul that so eagerly caught and assimilated all \nthe diverse impressions of life? How did they \nall find place in her? But she was very happy. \nAs they were near ing home she suddenly struck \nup the air of As 'twas growing dark last night- \nthe tune of which she had all the way been try- \ning to get and had at last caught. \n\n"Got it?" said Nicholas. \n\n"What were you thinking about just now, \nNicholas?" inquired Natdsha. \n\nThey were fond of asking one another that \nquestion. \n\n"I?" said Nicholas, trying to remember. \n"Well, you see, first I thought that Rugdy, the \nred hound, was like Uncle, and that if he were \na man he would always keep Uncle near him, \nif not for his riding, then for his manner. What \na good fellow Uncle is! Don't you think so? ... \nWell, and you?" \n\n"I? Wait a bit, wait Yes, first I thought \n\nthat we are driving along and imagining that \nwe are going home, but that heaven knows \nwhere we are really going in the darkness, and \nthat we shall arrive and suddenly find that we \nare not in Otrddnoe, but in Fairyland. And \nthen I thought . . . No, nothing else." \n\n"I know, I expect you thought of him," said \nNicholas, smiling as Natdsha knew by the \nsound of his voice. \n\n"No," said Natdsha, though she had in reali- \nty been thinking about Prince Andrew at the \nsame time as of the rest, and of how he would \nhave liked "Uncle." "And then I was saying to \nmyself all the way, 'How well Anfsya carried \nherself, how well!' " And Nicholas heard her \nspontaneous, happy, ringing laughter. "And \ndo you know," she suddenly said, "I know that \nI shall never again be as happy and tranquil as \nI am now." \n\n"Rubbish, nonsense, humbug!" exclaimed \nNicholas, and he thought: "How charming this \nNatdsha of mine is! I have no other friend like \nher and never shall have. Why should she \nmarry? We might always drive about together!" \n\n"What a darling this Nicholas of mine is!" \nthought Natdsha. \n\n"Ah, there are still lights in the drawing- \n\n\n\nBOOK SEVEN \n\n\n\n291 \n\n\n\nroom!" she said, pointing to the windows of \nthe house that gleamed invitingly in the moist \nvelvety darkness of the night. \n\nCHAPTER VIII \n\nCOUNT ILYA Rosi6v had resigned the position \nof Marshal of the Nobility because it involved \nhim in too much expense, but still his affairs \ndid not improve. Natasha and Nicholas often \nnoticed their parents conferring together anx- \niously and privately and heard suggestions of \nselling the fine ancestral Rost6v house and es- \ntate near Moscow. It was not necessary to en- \ntertain so freely as when the count had been \nMarshal, and life atOtrddnoe was quieter than \nin former years, but still the enormous house \nand its lodges were full of people and more \nthan twenty sat down to table every day. These \nwere all their own people who had settled \ndown in the house almost as members of the \nfamily, or persons who were, it seemed, obliged \nto live in the count's house. Such were Dimm- \nler the musician and his wife, Vogel the \ndancing master and his family, Bel6va, an old \nmaiden lady, an inmate of the house, and many \nothers such as P&lt;kya's tutors, the girls' former \ngoverness, and other people who simply found \nit preferable and more advantageous to live in \nthe count's house than at home. They had not \nas many visitors as before, but the old habits of \nlife without which the count and countess could \nnot conceive of existence remained unchanged. \nThere was still the hunting establishment \nwhich Nicholas had even enlarged, the same \nfifty horses and fifteen grooms in the stables, \nthe same expensive presents and dinner parr \nties to the whole district on name days; there \nwere still the count's games of whist and bos- \nton, at whichspreading out his cards so that \neverybody could see them he let himself be \nplundered of hundreds of rubles every day by \nhis neighbors, who looked upon an opportu- \nnity to play a rubber with Count Rost6v as a \nmost profitable source of income. \n\nThe count moved in his affairs as in a huge \nnet, trying not to believe that he was entangled \nbut becoming more and more so at every step, \nand feeling too feeble to break the meshes or \nto set to work carefully and patiently to disen- \ntangle them. The countess, with her loving \nheart, felt that her children were being ruined, \nthat it was not the count's fault for he could \nnot help being what he was that (though he \ntried to hide it) he himself suffered from the \nconsciousness of his own and his children's \nruin, and she tried to find means of remedying \n\n\n\nthe position. From her feminine point of view \nshe could see only one solution, namely, for \nNicholas to marry a rich heiress. She felt this to \nbe their last hope and that if Nicholas refused \nthe match she had found for him, she would \nhave to abandon the hope of ever getting mat- \nters right. This match was with Julie Karagina, \nthe daughter of excellent and virtuous parents, \na girl the Rost6vs had known from childhood, \nand who had now become a wealthy heiress \nthrough the death of the last of her brothers. \n\nThe countess had written direct to Julie's \nmother in Moscow suggesting a marriage be- \ntween their children and had received a favor- \nable answer from her. Karagina had replied \nthat for her part she was agreeable, and every- \nthing would depend on her daughter's incli- \nnation. She invited Nicholas to come to Mos- \ncow. \n\nSeveral times the countess, with tears in her \neyes, told her son that now both her daughters \nwere settled, her only wish was to see him mar- \nried. She said she could lie down in her grave \npeacefully if that were accomplished. Then \nshe told him that she knew of a splendid girl \nand tried to discover what he thought about \nmarriage. \n\nAt other times she praised Julie to him and \nadvised him to go to Moscow during the holi- \ndays to amuse himself. Nicholas guessed what \nhis mother's remarks were leading to and dur- \ning one of these conversations induced her to \nspeak quite frankly. She told him that her only \nhope of getting their affairs disentangled now \nlay in his marrying Julie Karagina. \n\n"But, Mamma, suppose I loved a girl who \nhas no fortune, would you expect me to sacri- \nfice my feelings and my honor for the sake of \nmoney?" he asked his mother, not realizing the \ncruelty of his question and only wishing to \nshow his noble-mindedness. \n\n"No, you have not understood me," said his \nmother, not knowing how to justify herself. \n"You have not understood me, Nikolenka. It \nis your happiness I wish for," she added, feel- \ning that she was telling an untruth and was \nbecoming entangled. She began to cry. \n\n"Mamma, don't cry! Only tell me that you \nwish it, and you know I will give my life, any- \nthing, to put you at ease," said Nicholas. "I \nwould sacrifice any thing for you even my feel- \nings." \n\nBut the countess did not want the question \nput like that: she did not want a sacrifice from \nher son, she herself wished to make a sacrifice \nfor him. \n\n\n\n2Q2 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\n"No, you have not understood me, don't let \nus talk about it," she replied, wiping away her \ntears. \n\n"Maybe I do love a poor girl," said Nicholas \nto himself. "Am I to sacrifice my feelings and \nmy honor for money? I wonder how Mamma \ncould speak so to me. Because S6nya is poor I \nmust not love her," he thought, "must not re- \nspond to her faithful, devoted love? Yet I \nshould certainly be happier with her than with \nsome doll-like Julie. I can always sacrifice my \nfeelings for my family's welfare," he said to \nhimself, "but I can't coerce my feelings. If I \nlove Sonya, that feeling is for me stronger and \nhigher than all else." \n\nNicholas did not go to Moscow, and the \ncountess did not renew the conversation with \nhim about marriage. She saw with sorrow, and \nsometimes with exasperation, symptoms of a \ngrowing attachment between her son and the \nportionless Sonya. Though she blamed herself \nfor it, she could not refrain from grumbling at \nand worrying Sonya, often pulling herup with- \nout reason, addressing her stiffly as "my dear," \nand using the formal "you" instead of the inti- \nmate "thou" in speaking to her. The kind- \nhearted countess was the more vexed with Son- \nya because that poor, dark-eyed niece of hers \nwas so meek, so kind, so devotedly grateful to \nher benefactors, and so faithfully, unchanging- \nly, and unselfishly in love with Nicholas, that \nthere were no grounds for finding fault with \nher. \n\nNicholas was spending the last of his leave \nat home. A fourth letter had come from Prince \nAndrew, from Rome, in which he wrote that \nhe would have been on his way back to Russia \nlong ago had not his wound unexpectedly re- \nopened in the warm climate, which obliged \nhim to defer his return till the beginning of \nthe new year. Natdsha was still as much in love \nwith her betrothed, found the same comfort in \nthat love, and was still as ready to throw her- \nself into all the pleasures of life as before; but \nat the end of the fourth month of their separa- \ntion she began to have fits of depression which \nshe could not master. She felt sorry for herself: \nsorry that she was being wasted all this time \nand of no use to anyonewhile she felt herself \nso capable of loving and being loved. \n\nThings were not cheerful in the Rost6vs* \nhome. \n\nCHAPTER IX \n\nCHRISTMAS CAME and except for the ceremonial \nMass, the solemn and wearisome Christmas \n\n\n\ncongratulations from neighbors and servants, \nand the new dresses everyone put on, there \nwere no special festivities, though the calm \nfrost of twenty degrees Reaumur, 1 the dazzling \nsunshine by day, and the starlight of the win- \nter nights seemed to call for some special cele- \nbration of the season. \n\nOn the third day of Christmas week, after \nthe midday dinner, all the inmates of the house \ndispersed to various rooms. It was the dullest \ntime of the day. Nicholas, who had been visit- \ning some neighbors that morning, was asleep \non the sitting-room sofa. The old count was \nresting in his study. Sonya sat in the drawing \nroom at the round table, copying a design for \nembroidery. The countess was play ing patience. \nNastasya Ivanovna the buffoon sat with a sad \nface at the window with two old ladies. Nata- \nsha came into the room, went up to S6nya, \nglanced at what she was doing, and then went \nup to her mother and stood without speaking. \n\n"Why are you wandering about like an out- \ncast?" asked her mother. "What do you want?" \n\n"Him ... I want him . . . now, this minute! I \nwant him!" said Natasha, with glittering eyes \nand no sign of a smile. \n\nThe countess lifted her head and looked at- \ntentively at her daughter. \n\n"Don't look at me, Mamma! Don't look; I \nshall cry directly." \n\n"Sit down with me a little," said the count- \ness. \n\n"Mamma, I want him. Why should I be \nwasted like this, Mamma?" \n\nHer voice broke, tears gushed from her eyes, \nand she turned quickly to hide them and left \nthe room. \n\nShe passed into the sitting room, stood there \nthinking awhile, and then went into the maids' \nroom. There an old maidservant was grum- \nbling at a young girl who stood panting, hav- \ning just run in through the cold from the serfs' \nquarters. \n\n"Stop playing there's a time for everything," \nsaid the old woman. \n\n"Let her alone, Kondratevna," said Natdsha. \n"Go, Mavrushka, go." \n\nHaving released Mavrushka, Natasha crossed \nthe dancing hall and went to the vestibule. \nThere an old footman and two young ones \nwere playing cards. They broke off and rose as \nshe entered. \n\n"What can I do with them?" thought Natd- \nsha. \n\n"Oh, Nikita, please go ... where can I send \n\n1 13 degrees below zero, Fahrenheit. TR. \n\n\n\nBOOK SEVEN \n\n\n\n293 \n\n\n\nhim? . . . Yes, go to the yard and fetch a fowl, \nplease, a cock, and you, Mfsha, bring me some \noats. M l \n\n"Just a few oats?" said Mfsha, cheerfully and \nreadily. \n\n"Go, go quickly," the old man urged him. \n\n"And you, Theodore, get me a piece of \nchalk." \n\nOn her way past the butler's pantry she told \nthem to set a samovar, though it was not at all \nthe time for tea. \n\nF6ka, the butler, was the most ill-tempered \nperson in the house. Natasha liked to test her \npower over him. He distrusted the order and \nasked whether the samovar was really wanted. \n\n"Oh dear, what a young lady!" said F6ka, \npretending to frown at Natdsha. \n\nNo one in the house sent people about or \ngave them as much trouble as Natdsha did. She \ncould not see people unconcernedly, but had \nto send them on some errand. She seemed to \nbe trying whether any of them would get angry \nor sulky with her; but the serfs fulfilled no \none's orders so readily as they did hers. "What \ncan I do, where can I go?" thought she, as she \nwent slowly along the passage. \n\n"Nastdsya Ivdnovna, what sort of children \nshall I have?" she asked the buffoon, who was \ncoming toward her in a woman's jacket. \n\n"Why, fleas, crickets, grasshoppers," an- \nswered the buffoon. \n\n"O Lord, O Lord, it's always the same! Oh, \nwhere am I to go? What am I to do with my- \nself?" And tapping with her heels, she ran \nquickly upstairs to see Vogel and his wife who \nlived on the upper story. \n\nTwo governesses were sitting with the Vogels \nat a table, on which were plates of raisins, wal- \nnuts, and almonds. The governesses were dis- \ncussing whether it was cheaper to live in Mos- \ncow or Odessa. Natdsha sat down, listened to \ntheir talk with a serious and thoughtful air, \nand then got up again. \n\n"The island of Madagascar," she said, "Ma- \nda-gas-car," she repeated, articulating each syl- \nlable distinctly, and, not replying to Madame \nSchoss who asked her what she was saying, she \nwent out of the room. \n\nHer brother Ptya was upstairs too; with the \nman in attendance on him he was preparing \nfireworks to let off that night. \n\n"Ptya! Ptya!" she called to him. "Carry me \ndownstairs." \n\n1 Feeding a fowl with grain arranged on the \nfloor is a way of telling fortunes at Christmastime. \n-TR. \n\n\n\nPtya ran up and offered her his back. She \njumped on it, putting her arms round his neck, \nand he pranced along with her. \n\n"No, don't . . . the island of Madagascar!" \nshe said, and jumping off his back she went \ndownstairs. \n\nHaving as it were reviewed her kingdom, \ntested her power, and made sure that everyone \nwas submissive, but that all the same it was \ndull, Natdsha betook herself to the ballroom, \npicked up her guitar, sat down in a dark corner \nbehind a bookcase, and began to run her fin- \ngers over the strings in the bass, picking out a \npassage she recalled from an opera she had \nheard in Petersburg with Prince Andrew. What \nshe drew from the guitar would have had no \nmeaning for other listeners, but in her imagi- \nnation a whole series of reminiscences arose \nfrom those sounds. She sat behind the book- \ncase with her eyes fixed on a streak of light es- \ncaping from the pantry door and listened to \nherself and pondered. She was in a mood for \nbrooding on the past. \n\nSonya passed to the pantry with a glass in \nher hand. Natdsha glanced at her and at the \ncrack in the pantry door, and it seemed to her \nthat she remembered the light falling through \nthat crack once before and Sonya passing with \na glass in her hand. "Yes, it was exactly the \nsame," thought Natasha. \n\n"S6nya, what is this?" she cried, twanging a \nthick string. \n\n"Oh, you are there!" said S6nya with a start, \nand came near and listened. "I don't know. A \nstorm?" she ventured timidly, afraid of being \nwrong. \n\n"There! That's just how she started and just \nhow she came up smiling timidly when all this \nhappened before," thought Natdsha, "and in \njust the same way I thought there was some- \nthing lacking in her." \n\n"No, it's the chorus from The Water-Carrier, \nlisten!" and Natdsha sang the air of the chorus \nso that Sonya should catch it. "Where were you \ngoing?" she asked. \n\n"To change the water in this glass. I am just \nfinishing the design." \n\n"You always find something to do, but I \ncan't," said Natdsha. "And where's Nicholas?" \n\n"Asleep, I think." \n\n"S6nya, go and wake him," said Natdsha. \n"Tell him I want him to come and sing." \n\nShe sat awhile, wondering what the mean- \ning of it all having happened before could be, \nand without solving this problem, or at all re- \ngretting not having done so, she again passed \n\n\n\n294 \n\nin fancy to the time when she was with him \n\nand he was looking at her with a lover's eyes. \n\n"Oh, if only he would come quicker! I am so \nafraid it will never be! And, worst of all, I am \ngrowing oldthat's the thing! There won't \nthen be in me what there is now. But perhaps \nhe'll come today, will come immediately. Per- \nhaps he has come and is sitting in the drawing \nroom. Perhaps he came yesterday and I have \nforgotten it." She rose, put down the guitar, \nand went to the drawing room. \n\nAll the domestic circle, tutors, governesses, \nand guests, were already at the tea table. The \nservants stood round the tablebut Prince An- \ndrew was not there and life was going on as be- \nfore. \n\n"Ah, here she is!" said the old count, when \nhe saw Natasha enter. "Well, sit down by me." \nBut Natasha stayed by her mother and glanced \nround as if looking for something. \n\n"Mamma!" she muttered, "give him to me, \ngive him, Mamma, quickly, quickly!" and she \nagain had difficulty in repressing her sobs. \n\nShe sat down at the table and listened to the \nconversation between the elders and Nicholas, \nwho had also come to the table. "My God, my \nGod! The same faces, the same talk, Papa hold- \ning his cup and blowing in the same way!" \nthought Natasha, feeling with horror a sense \nof repulsion rising up in her for the whole \nhousehold, because they were always the same. \n\nAfter tea, Nicholas, Sonya, and Natdshawent \nto the sitting room, to their favorite corner \nwhere their most intimate talks always began. \n\nCHAPTER X \n\nDOES IT EVER HAPPEN TO YOU," said Natdsha to \nher brother, when they settled down in the sit- \nting room, "does it ever happen to you to feel \nas if there were nothing more to come noth- \ning; that everything good is past? And to feel \nnot exactly dull, but sad?" \n\n"I should think so!" he replied. "I have felt \nlike that when everything was all right and \neveryone was cheerful. The thought has come \ninto my mind that I was already tired of it all, \nand that we must all die. Once in the regiment \nI had not gone to some merrymaking where \nthere was music . . . and suddenly 1 felt so de- \npressed ..." \n\n"Oh yes, I know, I know, I know!" Natdsha \ninterrupted him. "When I was quite little that \nused to be so with me. Do you remember when \nI was punished once about some plums? You \nwere all dancing, and I sat sobbing in the \nschoolroom? I shall never forget it: I felt sad \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\nand sorry for everyone, for myself, and for \neveryone. And I was innocent that was the \nchief thing," said Natdsha. "Do you remem- \nber?" \n\n"I remember," answered Nicholas. "I re- \nmember that I came to you afterwards and \nwanted to comfort you, but do you know, I felt \nashamed to. We were terribly absurd. I had a \nfunny doll then and wanted to give it to you. \nDo you remember?" \n\n"And do you remember," Natasha asked with \na pensive smile, "how once, long, long ago, \nwhen we were quite little, Uncle called us into \nthe study that was in the old house and it \nwas dark we went in and suddenly there \nstood . . ." \n\n"A Negro," chimed in Nicholas with a smile \nof delight. "Of course I remember. Even now \nI don't know whether there really was a Negro, \nor if we only dreamed it or were told about \nhim." \n\n"He was gray, you remember, and had white \nteeth, and stood and looked at us. . . ." \n\n"Sonya, do you remember?" asked Nicholas. \n\n"Yes, yes, I do remember something too," \nS6nya answered timidly. \n\n"You know I have asked Papa and Mamma \nabout that Negro," said Natasha, "and they say \nthere was no Negro at all. But you see, you re- \nmember!" \n\n"Of course I do, I remember his teeth as if I \nhad just seen them." \n\n"How strange it is! It's as if it were a dream! I \nlike that." \n\n"And do you remember how we rolled hard- \nboiled eggs in the ballroom, and suddenly two \nold women began spinning round on the car- \npet? Was that real or not? Do you remember \nwhat fun it was?" \n\n"Yes, and you remember how Papa in his \nblue overcoat fired a gun in the porch?" \n\nSo they went through their memories, smil- \ning with pleasure: not the sad memories of old \nage, but poetic, youthful ones those impres- \nsions of one's most distant past in which dreams \nand realities blend and they laughed with \nquiet enjoyment. \n\nS6nya, as always, did not quite keep pace \nwith them, though they shared the same remi- \nniscences. \n\nMuch that they remembered had slipped \nfrom her mind, and what she recalled did not \narouse the same poetic feeling as they experi- \nenced. She simply enjoyed their pleasure and \ntried to fit in with it. \n\nShe only really took part when they recalled \n\n\n\nBOOK SEVEN \n\n\n\nS6nya's first arrival. She told them how afraid \nshe had been of Nicholas because he had on a \ncorded jacket and her nurse had told her that \nshe, too, would be sewn up with cords. \n\n"And I remember their telling me that you \nhad been born under a cabbage," said Natdsha, \n"and I remember that I dared not disbelieve it \nthen, but knew that it was not true, and I felt \nso uncomfortable." \n\nWhile they were talking a maid thrust her \nhead in at the other door of the sitting room. \n\n"They have brought the cock, Miss," she \nsaid in a whisper. \n\n"It isn't wanted, P61ya. Tell them to take it \naway," replied Natdsha. \n\nIn the middle of their talk in the sitting \nroom, Dimmler came in and went up to the \nharp that stood there in a corner. He took off \nits cloth covering, and the harp gave out a jar- \nring sound. \n\n"Mr. Dimmler, please play my favorite noc- \nturne by Field," came the old countess' voice \nfrom the drawing room. \n\nDimmler struck a chord and, turning to Na- \ntasha, Nicholas, and Sonya, remarked: "How \nquiet you young people are!" \n\n"Yes, we're philosophizing," said Natdsha, \nglancing round for a moment and then con- \ntinuing the conversation. They were now dis- \ncussing dreams. \n\nDimmler began to play; Natasha went on \ntiptoe noiselessly to the table, took up a can- \ndle, carried it out, and returned, seating her- \nself quietly in her former place. It was dark in \nthe room especially where they were sitting on \nthe sofa, but through the big windows the sil- \nvery light of the full moon fell on the floor. \nDimmler had finished the piece but still sat \nsoftly running his fingers over the strings, evi- \ndently uncertain whether to stop or to play \nsomething else. \n\n"Do you know," said Natdsha in a whisper, \nmoving closer to Nicholas and S6nya, "that \nwhen one goes on and on recalling memories, \none at last begins to remember what happened \nbefore one was in the world " \n\n"That is metempsychosis," said S6nya, who \nhad always learned well, and remembered \neverything. "The Egyptians believed that our \nsouls have lived in animals, and will go back \ninto animals again." \n\n"No, I don't believe we ever were in ani- \nmals," said Natdsha, still in a whisper though \nthe music had ceased. "But I am certain that \nwe were angels somewhere there, and have been \nhere, and that is why we remember. . . ." \n\n\n\n"May I join you?" said Dimmler who had \ncome up quietly, and he sat down by them. \n\n"If we have been angels, why have we fallen \nlower?" said Nicholas. "No, that can't be!" \n\n"Not lower, who said we were lower? . . . \nHow do I know what I was before?" Natdsha \nrejoined with conviction. "The soul is immor- \ntalwell then, if I shall always live I must have \nlived before, lived for a whole eternity." \n\n"Yes, but it is hard for us to imagine eter- \nnity," remarked Dimmler, who had joined the \nyoung folk with a mildly condescending smile \nbut now spoke as quietly and seriously as they. \n\n"Why is it hard to imagine eternity?" said \nNatasha. "It is now today, and it will be to- \nmorrow, and always; and there was yesterday, \nand the day before. . . ." \n\n"Natdsha! Now it's your turn. Sing me some- \nthing," they heard the countess say. "Why are \nyou sitting there like conspirators?" \n\n"Mamma, I don't at all want to," replied \nNatdsha, but all the same she rose. \n\nNone of them, not even the middle-aged \nDimmler, wanted to break off their conversa- \ntion and quit that corner in the sitting room, \nbut Natdsha got up and Nicholas sat down at \nthe clavichord. Standing as usual in the mid- \ndle of the hall and choosing the place where \nthe resonance was best, Natdsha began to sing \nher mother's favorite song. \n\nShe had said she did not want to sing, but it \nwas long since she had sung, and long before \nshe again sang, as she did that evening. The \ncount, from his study where he was talking to \nMitenka, heard her and, like a schoolboy in a \nhurry to run out to play, blundered in his talk \nwhile giving orders to the steward, and at last \nstopped, while Mftenka stood in front of him \nalso listening and smiling. Nicholas did not \ntake his eyes off his sister and drew breath in \ntime with her. Sonya, as she listened, thought \nof the immense difference there was between \nherself and her friend, and how impossible it \nwas for her to be anything like as bewitching \nas her cousin. The old countess sat with a bliss- \nful yet sad smile and with tears in her eyes, oc- \ncasionally shaking her head. She thought of \nNatdsha and of her own youth, and of how \nthere was something unnatural and dreadful \nin this impending marriage of Natdsha and \nPrince Andrew. \n\nDimmler, who had seated himself beside the \ncountess, listened with closed eyes. \n\n"Ah, Countess," he said at last, "that's a Euro- \npean talent, she has nothing to learn what \nsoftness, tenderness, and strength. . . ." \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\n"Ah, how afraid I am for her, how afraid I \nami" said the countess, not realizing to whom \nshe was speaking. Her maternal instinct told \nher that Natisha had too much of something, \nand that because of this she would not be hap- \npy. Before Natdsha had finished singing, four- \nteen-year-old Ptya rushed in delightedly, to \nsay that some mummers had arrived. \n\nNatasha stopped abruptly. \n\n"Idiot I" she screamed at her brother and, \nrunning to a chair, threw herself on it, sobbing \nso violently that she could not stop for a long \ntime. \n\n"It's nothing, Mamma, really it's nothing; \nonly P^tya startled me," she said, trying to \nsmile, but her tears still flowed and sobs still \nchoked her. \n\nThe mummers (some of the house serfs) \ndressed up as bears, Turks, innkeepers, and \nladiesfrightening and funny bringing in \nwith them the cold from outside and a feeling \nof gaiety, crowded, at first timidly, into the \nanteroom, then hiding behind one another they \npushed into the ballroom where, shyly at first \nand then more and more merrily and heartily, \nthey started singing, dancing, and playing \nChristmas games. The countess, when she had \nidentified them and laughed at their costumes, \nwent into the drawing room. The count sat in \nthe ballroom, smiling radiantly and applaud- \ning the players. The young people had disap- \npeared. \n\nHalf an hour later there appeared among \nthe other mummers in the ballroom an old \nlady in a hooped skirt this was Nicholas. A \nTurkish girl was P^tya. A clown was Dimmler. \nAn hussar was Natasha, and a Circassian was \nS6nya with burnt-cork mustache and eyebrows. \n\nAfter the condescending surprise, nonrecog- \nnition, and praise, from those who were not \nthemselves dressed up, the young people de- \ncided that their costumes were so good that \nthey ought to be shown elsewhere. \n\nNicholas, who, as the roads were in splendid \ncondition, wanted to take them all for a drive \nin his troyka, proposed to take with them about \na dozen of the serf mummers and drive to "Un- \ncle's." \n\n"No, why disturb the old fellow?" said the \ncountess. "Besides, you wouldn't have room to \nturn round there. If you must go, go to the \nMelyuk6vs'." \n\nMelyuk6va was a widow, who, with her fami- \nly and their tutors and governesses, lived three \nmiles from the Rost6vs. \n\n"That's right, my dear," chimed in the old \n\n\n\ncount, thoroughly aroused. "I'll dress up at \nonce and go with them. I'll make Pashetteopen \nher eyes." \n\nBut the countess would not agree to his go- \ning; he had had a bad leg all these last days. It \nwas decided that the count must not go, but \nthat if Louisa Ivdnovna (Madame Schoss) \nwould go with them, the young ladies might go \nto the Melyuk6vs', S6nya, generally so timid \nand shy, more urgently than anyone begging \nLouisa Ivanovna not to refuse. \n\nS6nya's costume was the best of all. Her mus- \ntache and eyebrows were extraordinarily be- \ncoming. Everyone told her she looked very \nhandsome, and she was in a spirited a-nd ener- \ngetic mood unusual with her. Some inner voice \ntold her that now or never her fate would be \ndecided, and in her male attire she seemed \nquite a different person. Louisa Ivdnovna con- \nsented to go, and in half an hour four troyka \nsleighs with large and small bells, their run- \nners squeaking and whistling over the frozen \nsnow, drove up to the porch. \n\nNatasha was foremost in setting a merry holi- \nday tone, which, passing from one to another, \ngrew stronger and stronger and reached its \nclimax when they all came out into the frost \nand got into the sleighs, talking, calling to one \nanother, laughing, and shouting. \n\nTwo of the troykas were the usual house- \nhold sleighs, the third was the old count's with \na trotter from the Orl6v stud as shaft horse, \nthe fourth was Nicholas* own with a short shag- \ngy black shaft horse. Nicholas, in his old lady's \ndress over which he had belted his hussar over- \ncoat, stood in the middle of the sleigh, reins in \nhand. \n\nIt was so light that he could see the moon- \nlight reflected from the metal harness disks \nand from the eyes of the horses, who looked \nround in alarm at the noisy party under the \nshadow of the porch roof. \n\nNatdsha, S6nya, Madame Schoss, and two \nmaids got into Nicholas' sleigh; Dimmler, his \nwife, and Ptya, into the old count's, and the \nrest of the mummers seated themselves in the \nother two sleighs. \n\n"You go ahead, Zakhdrl" shouted Nicholas \nto his father's coachman, wishing for a chance \nto race past him. \n\nThe old count's troyka, with Dimmler and \nhis party, started forward, squeaking on its \nrunners as though freezing to the snow, its \ndeep-toned bell clanging. The side horses, \npressing against the shafts of the middle \nhorse, sank in the snow, which was dry and \n\n\n\nBOOK SEVEN \n\n\n\nglittered like sugar, and threw it up. \n\nNicholas set off, following the first sleigh; \nbehind him the others moved noisily, their \nrunners squeaking. At first they drove at a \nsteady trot along the narrow road. While they \ndrove past the garden the shadows of the bare \ntrees often fell across the road and hid the \nbrilliant moonlight, but as soon as they were \npast the fence, the snowy plain bathed in moon- \nlight and motionless spread out before them \nglittering like diamonds and dappled with \nbluish shadows. Bang, bang! went the first \nsleigh over a cradle hole in the snow of the \nroad, and each of the other sleighs jolted in \nthe same way, and rudely breaking the frost- \nbound stillness, the troykas began to speed \nalong the road, one after the other. \n\n"A hare's track, a lot of tracks!" rang out Na- \ntAsha's voice through the frost-bound air. \n\n"How light it is, Nicholas!" came S6nya's \nvoice. \n\nNicholas glanced round at S6nya, and bent \ndown to see her face closer. Quite a new, sweet \nface with black eyebrows and mustaches peeped \nup at him from her sable furs so close and yet \nso distant in the moonlight. \n\n"That used to be S6nya," thought he, and \nlooked at her closer and smiled. \n\n"What is it, Nicholas?" \n\n"Nothing," said he and turned again to the \nhorses. \n\nWhen they came out onto the beaten high- \nroadpolished by sleigh runners and cut up \nby rough-shod hoofs, the marks of which were \nvisible in the moonlight the horses began to \ntug at the reins of their own accord and in- \ncreased their pace. The near side horse, arch- \ning his head and breaking into a short canter, \ntugged at his traces. The shaft horse swayed \nfrom side to side, moving his ears as if asking: \n"Isn't it time to begin now?" In front, already \nfar ahead the deep bell of the sleigh ringing \nfarther and farther off, the black horses driven \nby Zakhar could be clearly seen against the \nwhite snow. From that sleigh one could hear \nthe shouts, laughter, and voices of the mum- \nmers. \n\n"Gee up, my darlings!" shouted Nicholas, \npulling the reins to one side and flourishing \nthe whip. \n\nIt was only by the keener wind that met \nthem and the jerks given by the side horses \nwho pulled harder ever increasing their gal- \nlopthat one noticed how fast the troyka was \nflying. Nicholas looked back. With screams, \nsqueals, and waving of whips that caused even \n\n\n\nthe shaft horses to gallop the other sleighs fol- \nlowed. The shaft horse swung steadily beneath \nthe bow over its head, with no thought of \nslackening pace and ready to put on speed \nwhen required. \n\nNicholas overtook the first sleigh. They were \ndriving downhill and coming out upon a broad \ntrodden track across a meadow, near a river. \n\n"Where are we?" thought he. "It's the Kos6y \nmeadow, I suppose. But no this is something \nnew I've never seen before. This isn't the Ko- \nsoy meadow nor the Demkin hill, and heaven \nonly knows what it is! It is something new and \nenchanted. Well, whatever it may be . . ." And \nshouting to his horses, he began to pass the first \nsleigh. \n\nZakhar held back his horses and turned his \nface, which was already covered with hoarfrost \nto his eyebrows. \n\nNicholas gave the horses the rein, and Zak- \nhdr, stretching out his arms, clucked his tongue \nand let his horses go. \n\n"Now, look out, master!" he cried. \n\nFaster still the two troykas flew side by side, \nand faster moved the feet of the galloping side \nhorses. Nicholas began to draw ahead. Zakhar, \nwhile still keeping his arms extended, raised \none hand with the reins. \n\n"No you won't, master!" he shouted. \n\nNicholas put all his horses to a gallop and \npassed Zakhar. The horses showered the fine \ndry snow on the faces of those in the sleigh \nbeside them sounded quick ringing bells and \nthey caught confused glimpses of swiftly mov- \ning legs and the shadows of the troyka they \nwere passing. The whistling sound of the run- \nners on the snow and the voices of girls shriek- \ning were heard from different sides. \n\nAgain checking his horses, Nicholas looked \naround him. They were still surrounded by the \nmagic plain bathed in moonlight andspangled \nwith stars. \n\n"Zakhdr is shouting that I should turn to the \nleft, but why to the left?" thought Nicholas. \n"Are we getting to the Melyuk6vs'? Is this Mel- \nyukovka? Heaven only knows where we are go- \ning, and heaven knows what is happening to \nus but ft is very strange and pleasant what- \never it is." And he looked round in the sleigh. \n\n"Look, his mustache and eyelashes are all \nwhite!" said one of the strange, pretty, unfa- \nmiliar people the one with fine eyebrows and \nmustache. \n\n"I think this used to be Natasha," thought \nNicholas, "and that was Madame Schoss, but \nperhaps it's not, and this Circassian with the \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nmustache I don't know, but I love her." \n\n"Aren't you cold?" he asked. \n\nThey did not answer but began to laugh. \nDimmler from the sleigh behind shouted some- \nthing probably something funny but they \ncould not make out what he said. \n\n"Yes, yes!" some voices answered, laughing. \n\n"But here was a fairy forest with black mov- \ning shadows, and a glitter of diamonds and a \nflight of marble steps and the silver roofs of \nfairy buildings and the shrill yells of some ani- \nmals. And if this is really Melyuk6vka, it is still \nstranger that we drove heaven knows where \nand have come to Melyuk6vka," thought Nich- \nolas. \n\nIt really was Melyuk6vka, and maids and \nfootmen with merry faces came running out to \nthe porch carrying candles. \n\n"Who is it?" asked someone in the porch, \n\n"The mummers from the count's. I know by \nthe horses," replied some voices. \n\nCHAPTER XI \n\nPELAGYA DANILOVNA MELYUK6vA, a broadly \nbuilt, energetic woman wearing spectacles, sat \nin the drawing room in a loose dress, sur- \nrounded by her daughters whom she was try- \ning to keep from feeling dull. They were quiet- \nly dropping melted wax into snow and looking \nat the shadows the wax figures would throw on \nthe wall, when they heard the steps and voices \nof new arrivals in the vestibule. \n\nHussars, ladies, witches, clowns, and bears, \nafter clearing their throats and wiping the \nhoarfrost from their faces in the vestibule, \ncame into the ballroom where candles were \nhurriedly lighted. The clown Dimmler and \nthe lady Nicholas started a dance. Sur- \nrounded by the screaming children the mum- \nmers, covering their faces and disguising their \nvoices, bowed to their hostess and arranged \nthemselves about the room. \n\n"Dear me! there's no recognizing them! And \nNatdsha! See whom she looks like! She really \nreminds me of somebody. But Herr Dimmler \nisn't he good! I didn't know him! And how \nhe dances. Dear me, there's a Circassian. Real- \nly, how becoming it is to dear S6nya. And who \nis that? Well, you have cheered us up! Nikfta \nand Vdnya clear away the tables! And we \nwere sitting so quietly. Ha, ha, ha! ... The \nhussar, the hussar! Just like a boy! And the \nlegs! ... I can't look at him . . ." different \nvoices were saying. \n\nNatdsha, the young Melyuk6vs' favorite, dis- \nappeared with them into the back rooms where \n\n\n\na cork and various dressing gowns and male \ngarments were called for arid received from \nthe footman by bare girlish arms from behind \nthe door. Ten minutes later, all the young Mel- \nyuk6vs joined the mummers. \n\nPelage*ya Danflovna, having given orders to \nclear the rooms for the visitors and arranged \nabout refreshments for the gentry and the serfs, \nwent about among the mummers without re- \nmoving her spectacles, peering into their faces \nwith a suppressed smile and failing to recog- \nnize any of them. It was not merely Dimmler \nand the Rost6vs she failed to recognize, she did \nnot even recognize her own daughters, or her \nlate husband's dressing gowns and uniforms, \nwhich they had put on. \n\n"And who is this?" she asked her governess, \npeering into the face of her own daughter \ndressed up as a Kazdn-Tartar. "I suppose it is \none of theRost6vs! Well, Mr. Hussar, and what \nregiment do you serve in?" she asked Natasha. \n"Here, hand some fruit jelly to the Turk!" she \nordered the butler who was handing things \nround. "That's not forbidden by his law." \n\nSometimes, as she looked at the strange but \namusing capers cut by the dancers, who hav- \ning decided once for all that being disguised, \nno one would recognize them were not at all \nshy, Pclage'ya Danflovna hid her face in her \nhandkerchief, and her whole stout body shook \nwith irrepressible, kindly, elderly laughter. \n\n"My little Sasha! Look at Sdsha!" she said. \n\nAfter Russian country dances and chorus \ndances, Pelagdya Danflovna made the serfs and \ngentry join in one large circle: a ring, a string, \nand a silver ruble were fetched and they all \nplayed games together. \n\nIn an hour, all the costumes were crumpled \nand disordered. The corked eyebrows and mus- \ntaches were smeared over the perspiring, \nflushed, and merry faces. Pelage"ya Danilovna \nbegan to recognize the mummers, admired \ntheir cleverly contrived costumes, and particu- \nlarly how they suited the young ladies, and she \nthanked them all for having entertained her \nso well. The visitors were invited to supper in \nthe drawing room, and the serfs had something \nserved to them in the ballroom. \n\n"Now to tell one's fortune in the empty bath- \nhouse is frightening!" said an old maid who \nlived with the Melyuk6vs, during supper. \n\n"Why?" said the eldest Melyuk6v girl. \n\n"You wouldn't go, it takes courage. . . ." \n\n"I'll go," said S6nya. \n\n"Tell what happened to the young lady!" \nsaid the second Melyuktiv girl. \n\n\n\nBOOK SEVEN \n\n\n\n*99 \n\n\n\n"Well," began the old maid, "a young lady \nonce went out, took a cock, laid the table for \ntwo, all properly, and sat down. After sitting a \nwhile, she suddenly hears someone coming . . . \na sleigh drives up with harness bells; she hears \nhim coming! He comes in, just in the shape of \na man, like an officer comes in and sits down \nto table with her." \n\n"Ah! ah!" screamed Natdsha, rolling her \neyes with horror. \n\n"Yes? And how . . . did he speak?" \n\n"Yes, like a man. Everything quite all right, \nand he began persuading her; and she should \nhave kept him talking till cockcrow, but shegot \nfrightened, just got frightened and hid her face \nin her hands. Then he caught her up. It was \nlucky the maids ran in just then. . . ." \n\n"Now, why frighten them?" said Pelagdya \nDanflovna. \n\n"Mamma, you used to try your fate your- \nself . . ." said her daughter. \n\n"And how does one do it in a barn?" in- \nquired S6nya. \n\n"Well, say you went to the barn now, and lis- \ntened. It depends on what you hear; hammer- \ning and knocking that's bad; but a sound of \nshifting grain is good and one sometimes hears \nthat, too." \n\n"Mamma, tell us what happened to you in \nthe barn." \n\nPelagya Danilovna smiled. \n\n"Oh, I've forgotten . . ." she replied. "But \nnone of you would go?" \n\n"Yes, I will; Pelag^ya Danilovna, let mel I'll \ngo," said S6nya. \n\n"Well, why not, if you're not afraid?" \n\n"Louisa Ivanovna, may I?" asked S6nya. \n\nWhether they were playing the ring and \nstring game or the ruble game or talking as \nnow, Nicholas did not leave S6nya's side, and \ngazed at her with quite new eyes. It seemed to \nhim that it was only today, thanks to that burnt- \ncork mustache, that he had fully learned to \nknow her. And really, that evening, S6nya was \nbrighter, more animated, and prettier than \nNicholas had ever seen her before. \n\n"So that's what she is like; what a fool I have \nbeen!" he thought gazing at her sparkling eyes, \nand under the mustache a happy rapturous \nsmile dimpled her cheeks, a smile he had never \nseen before. \n\n"I'm not afraid of anything," said S6nya. \n"May I go at once?" She got up. \n\nThey told her where the barn was and how \nshe should stand and listen, and they handed \nher a fur cloak. She threw this over her head \n\n\n\nand shoulders and glanced at Nicholas. \n\n"What a darling that girl is!" thought he. \n"And what have I been thinking of till now?" \n\nS6nya went out into the passage to go to the \nbarn. Nicholas went hastily to the front porch, \nsaying he felt too hot. The crowd of people \nreally had made the house stuffy. \n\nOutside, there was the same cold stillness and \nthe same moon, but even brighter than before. \nThe light was so strong and the snow sparkled \nwith so many stars that one did not wish to \nlook up at the sky and the real stars were un- \nnoticed. The sky was black and dreary, while \nthe earth was gay. \n\n"I am a fool, a fool! what have I been wait- \ning for?" thought Nicholas, and running out \nfrom the porch he went round the corner of \nthe house and along the path that led to the \nback porch. He knew Sonya would pass that \nway. Halfway lay some snow-covered piles of \nfirewood and across and along them a network \nof shadows from the bare old lime trees fell on \nthe snow and on the path. This path led to the \nbarn. The log walls of the barn and its snow- \ncovered roof, that looked as if hewn out of \nsome precious stone, sparkled in the moon- \nlight. A tree in the garden snapped with the \nfrost, and then all was again perfectly silent. \nHis bosom seemed to inhale not air but the \nstrength of eternal youth and gladness. \n\nFrom the back porch came the sound of feet \ndescending the steps, the bottom step upon \nwhich snow had fallen gave a ringing creak and \nhe heard the voice of an old maidservant say- \ning, "Straight, straight, along the path, Miss. \nOnly, don't look back." \n\n"I am not afraid," answered S6nya's voice, \nand along the path toward Nicholas came the \ncrunching, whistling sound of S6nya's feet in \nher thin shoes. \n\nS6nya came along, wrapped in her cloak. \nShe was only a couple of paces away when she \nsaw him, and to her too he was not the Nich- \nolas she had known and always slightly feared. \nHe was in a woman's dress, with tousled hair \nand a happy smile new to S6nya.Sheran rapid- \nly toward him. \n\n"Quite different and yet the same," thought \nNicholas, looking at her face all lit up by the \nmoonlight. He slipped his arms under the \ncloak that covered her head, embraced her, \npressed her to him, and kissed her on the lips \nthat wore a mustache and had a smell of burnt \ncork. S6nya kissed him full on the lips, and \ndisengaging her little hands pressed them to \nhis cheeks. \n\n\n\ngoo \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\n"S6nya!" . . . "Nicholas!" . . . was all they \nsaid. They ran to the barn and then back \nagain, re-entering, he by the front and she \nby the back porch. \n\nCHAPTER XII \n\nWHEN THEY ALL DROVE BACK from Pelage*ya \nDanilovna's, Natasha, who always saw and no- \nticed everything, arranged that she and Ma- \ndame Schoss should go back in the sleigh with \nDimmler, and Sonya with Nicholas and the \nmaids. \n\nOn the way back Nicholas drove at a steady \npace instead of racing and kept peering by that \nfantastic all-transforming light into S6nya's \nface and searching beneath the eyebrows and \nmustache for his former and his present Sonya \nfrom whom he had resolved never to be parted \nagain. He looked and recognizing in her both \nthe old and the newS6nya,andbeingreminded \nby the smell of burnt cork of the sensation of \nher kiss, inhaled the frosty air with a lull breast \nand, looking at the ground flying beneath him \nand at the sparkling sky, felt himself again in \nfairyland. \n\n"Sonya, is it well with thee?" he asked from \ntime to time. \n\n"Yes!" she replied. "And with thee?" \n\nWhen halfway home Nicholas handed the \nreins to the coachman and ran for a moment \nto Natasha's sleigh and stood on its wing. \n\n"Natasha!" he whispered in French, "do you \nknow I have made up my mind about Sonya?" \n\n"Have you told her?" asked Natasha, sud- \ndenly beaming all over with joy. \n\n"Oh, how strange you are with that mus- \ntache and those eyebrows! . . . Natasha are \nyou glad?" \n\n"I am so glad, so glad! I was beginning to be \nvexed with you. I did not tell you, but you have \nbeen treating her badly. What a heart she has, \nNicholas! I am horrid sometimes, but I was \nashamed to be happy while Sonya was not," \ncontinued Natasha. "Now I am so glad! Well, \nrun back to her." \n\n"No, wait a bit. . . . Oh, how funny you look!" \ncried Nicholas, peering into her face and find- \ning in his sister too something new, unusual, \nand bewitchingly tender that he had not seen \nin her before. "Natlsha, it's magical, isn't it?" \n\n"Yes/' she replied. "You have done splendid- \nly." \n\n"Had I seen her before as she is now," thought \nNicholas, "I should long ago have asked her \nwhat to do and have done whatever she told \nme, and all would have been well." \n\n\n\n"So you are glad and I have done right?" \n\n"Oh, quite right! I had a quarrel with Mam- \nma some time ago about it. Mamma said she \nwas angling for you. How could she say such a \nthing! I nearly stormed at Mamma. I will never \nlet anyone say anything bad of S6nya, for there \nis nothing but good in her." \n\n"Then it's all right?" said Nicholas, again \nscrutinizing the expression of his sister's face \nto see if she was in earnest. Then he jumped \ndown and, his boots scrunching the snow, ran \nback to his sleigh. The same happy, smilingCir- \ncassian, with mustache and beaming eyes look- \ning up from under a sablehood, was still sitting \nthere, and that Circassian was S6nya, and that \nScmya was certainly his future happy and lov- \ning wife. \n\nWhen they reached home and had told their \nmother how they had spent the evening at the \nMelyukrivs', the girls went to their bedroom. \nWhen they had undressed, but without wash- \ning off the cork mustaches, they sat a long time \ntalking of their happiness. They talked of how \nthey would live when they were married, how \ntheir husbands would be friends, and how hap- \npy they would be. On Natasha's table stood \ntwo looking glasses which Dunydsha had pre- \npared beforehand. \n\n"Only when will all that be? I am afraid nev- \ner. ... It would be too good!" said Natdsha, \nrising and going to the looking glasses. \n\n"Sit down, Natasha; perhaps you'll see him," \nsaid Sonya. \n\nNatasha lit the candles, one on each side of \none of the looking glasses, and sat down. \n\n"I see someone with a mustache," said Na- \ntasha, seeing her own face. \n\n"You mustn't laugh, Miss," said Dunyasha. \n\nWith S6nya's help and the maid's, Natdsha \ngot the glass she held into the right position \nopposite the other; her face assumed a serious \nexpression and she sat silent. She sat a long \ntime looking at the receding line of candles re- \nflected in the glasses and expecting (from tales \nshe had heard) to see a coffin, or him, Prince \nAndrew, in that last dim, indistinctly outlined \nsquare. But ready as she was to take the small- \nest speck for the image of a man or of a coffin, \nshe saw nothing. She began blinking rapidly \nand moved away from the looking glasses. \n\n"Why is it others see things arid I don't?" she \nsaid. "You sit down now, S6nya. You absolute- \nly must, tonight! Do it for me Today I feel \n\nso frightened!" \n\nS6nya sat down before the glasses, got the \nright position, and began looking. \n\n\n\nBOOK SEVEN \n\n\n\n301 \n\n\n\n"Now, Miss S6nya is sure to see something," \nwhispered Dunydsha; "while you do nothing \nbut laugh." \n\nS6nya heard this and Natasha's whisper: \n\n"I know she will. She saw something last \nyear." \n\nFor about three minutes all were silent. \n\n"Of course she will!" whispered Natasha, \nbut did not finish . . . suddenly S6nya pushed \naway the glass she was holding and covered her \neyes with her hand. \n\n"Oh, Natdsha!" she cried. \n\n"Did you see? Did you? What was it?" ex- \nclaimed Natdsha, holding up the looking glass. \n\nS6nya had not seen anything, she was just \nwanting to blink and to get up when she heard \nNatdsha say, "Of course she will!" She did not \nwish to disappoint cither Dunyashaor Natasha, \nbut it was hard to sit still. She did not herself \nknow how or why the exclamation escaped her \nwhen she covered her eyes. \n\n"You saw him?" urged Natasha, seizing her \nhand. \n\n"Yes. Wait a bit ... I ... saw him," S6nya \ncould not help saying, not yet knowing whom \nNatasha meant by him, Nicholas or Prince An- \ndrew. \n\n"But why shouldn't I say I saw something? \nOthers do see! Besides who can tell whether I \nsaw anything or not?" flashed through S6nya's \nmind. \n\n"Yes, I saw him," she said. \n\n"How? Standing or lying?" \n\n"No, I saw ... At first there was nothing, \nthen I saw him lying down." \n\n"Andrew lying? Is he ill?" asked Natdsha,her \nfrightened eyes fixed on her friend. \n\n"No, on the contrary, on the contrary! His \nface was cheerful, and he turned to me." And \nwhen saying this she herself fancied she had \nreally seen what she described. \n\n"Well, and then, S6nya? . . ." \n\n"After that, I could not make out what there \nwas; something blue and red " \n\n"S6nyal When will he come back? When \nshall I see him! O, God, how afraid I am for \nhim and for myself and about everything! . . ." \nNatisha began, and without replying to S6nya's \nwords of comfort she got into bed, and long \nafter her candle was out lay open-eyed and mo- \ntionless, gazing at the moonlight through the \nfrosty windowpanes. \n\nCHAPTER XIII \n\nSOON AFTER THE CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS Nicholas \n\ntold his mother of his love for S6nya and of his \n\n\n\nfirm resolve to marry her. The countess, who \nhad long noticed what was going on between \nthem and was expecting this declaration, lis- \ntened to him in silence and then told her son \nthat he might marry whom he pleased, but \nthat neither she nor his father would give their \nblessing to such a marriage. Nicholas, for the \nfirst time, felt that his mother was displeased \nwith him and that, despite her love for him, \nshe would not give way. Coldly, without look- \ning at her son, she sent for her husband and, \nwhen he came, tried briefly and coldly to in- \nform him of the facts, in her son's presence, but \nunable to restrain herself she burst into tears of \nvexation and left the room. The old count be- \ngan irresolutely to admonish Nicholas and beg \nhim to abandon his purpose. Nicholas replied \nthat he could not go back on his word, and his \nfather, sighing and evidently disconcerted, very \nsoon became silent and went in to the countess. \nIn all his encounters with his son, the count \nwas always conscious of his own guilt toward \nhim for having wasted the family fortune, and \nso he could not be angry with him for refus- \ning to marry an heiress and choosing the dower- \nless S6nya. On this occasion, he was only more \nvividly conscious of the fact that if his affairs \nhad not been in disorder, no better wife for \nNicholas than S6nya could have been wished \nfor, and that no one but himself with his Mi- \ntenka and his uncomfortable habits was to \nblame for the condition of the family finances. \n\nThe father and mother did not speak of the \nmatter to their son again, but a few days later \nthe countess sent for S6nya and, with a cruelty \nneither of them expected, reproached her niece \nfor trying to catch Nicholas and for ingrati- \ntude. Sonya listened silently with downcast eyes \nto the countess' cruel words, without under- \nstanding what was required of her. She was \nready to sacrifice everything for her benefac- \ntors. Self-sacrifice was her most cherished idea; \nbut in this case she could not see what she \nought to sacrifice, or for whom. She could not \nhelp loving the countess and the whole Rost6v \nfamily, but neither could she help loving Nich- \nolas and knowing that his happiness depended \non that love. She was silent and sad and did \nnot reply. Nicholas felt the situation to be in- \ntolerable and went to have an explanation with \nhis mother. He first implored her to forgive \nhim and S6nya and consent to their marriage, \nthen he threatened that if she molested S6nya \nhe would at once marry her secretly. \n\nThe countess, with a coldness her son had \nnever seen in her before, replied that he was \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nof age, that Prince Andrew was marrying with- \nout his father's consent, and he could do the \nsame, but that she would never receive that \nintriguer as her daughter. \n\nExploding at the word intriguer, Nicholas, \nraising his voice, told his mother he had never \nexpected her to try to force him to sell his feel- \nings, but if that were so, he would say for the \nlast time . . . But he had no time to utter the de- \ncisive word which the expression of his face \ncaused his mother to await with terror, and \nwhich would perhaps have forever remained a \ncruel memory to them both. He had not time \nto say it, for Natdsha, with a pale and set face, \nentered the room from the door at which she \nhad been listening. \n\n"Nicholas, you are talking nonsense! Be qui- \net, be quiet, be quiet, I tell you! . . ." she almost \nscreamed, so as to drown his voice. \n\n"Mamma darling, it's not at all so ... my \npoor, sweet darling," she said to her mother, \nwho conscious that they had been on the brink \nof a rupture gazed at her son with terror, but \nin the obstinacy and excitement of the conflict \ncould not and would not give way. \n\n"Nicholas, I'll explain to you. Go away! Lis- \nten, Mamma darling," said Natdsha. \n\nHer words were incoherent, but they attained \nthe purpose at which she was aiming. \n\nThe countess, sobbing heavily, hid her face \non her daughter's breast, while Nicholas rose, \nclutching his head, and left the room. \n\nNatasha set to work to effect a reconciliation, \nand so far succeeded that Nicholas received a \npromise from his mother that Sonya should not \nbe troubled, while he on his side promised not \nto undertake anything without his parents' \nknowledge. \n\nFirmly resolved, after putt ing his affairs in or- \nder in the regiment, to retire from the army and \nreturn and marry S6nya, Nicholas, serious, sor- \nrowful, and at variance with his parents, but, \nas it seemed to him, passionately in love, left at \nthe beginning of January to rejoin his regi- \nment. \n\nAfter Nicholas had gone things in the Ros- \n\n\n\nt6v household were more depressing than ever, \nand the countess fell ill from mental agitation. \n\nS6nya was unhappy at the separation from \nNicholas and still more so on account of the \nhostile tone the countess could not help adopt- \ning toward her. The count was more perturbed \nthan ever by the condition of his affairs, which \ncalled for some decisive action. Their town \nhouse and estate near Moscow had inevitably \nto be sold, and for this they had to go to Mos- \ncow. But the countess' health obliged them to \ndelay their departure from day to day. \n\nNatasha, who had borne the first period of \nseparation from her betrothed lightly and even \ncheerfully, now grew more agitated and impa- \ntient every day. The thought that her best days, \nwhich she would have employed in loving him, \nwere being vainly wasted, with no advantage to \nanyone, tormented her incessantly. His letters \nfor the most part irritated her. It hurt her to \nthink that while she lived only in the thought \nof him, he was living a real life, seeing new \nplaces and new people that interested him. \nThe more interesting his letters were the more \nvexed she felt. Her letters to him, far from giv- \ning her any comfort, seemed to her a wearisome \nand artificial obligation. She could not write, \nbecause she could not conceive the possibility \nof expressing sincerely in a letter even a thou- \nsandth part of what she expressed by voice, \nsmile, and glance. She wrote to him formal, \nmonotonous, and dry letters, to which she at- \ntached no importance herself, and in the rough \ncopies of which the countess corrected her mis- \ntakes in spelling. \n\nThere was still no improvement in the count- \ness' health, but it was impossible to defer the \njourney to Moscowany longer. Natasha's trous- \nseau had to be ordered and the house sold. \nMoreover, Prince Andrew was expected in \nMoscow, where old Pri nee Bolk6nski was spend- \ning the winter, and Natdsha felt sure he had al- \nready arrived. \n\nSo the countess remained in the country, and \nthe count, taking S6nya and Natdsha with him, \nwent to Moscow at the end of January. \n\n\n\nBook Eight: 1811-12 \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I \n\nAFTER PRINCE ANDREW'S engagement to Na- \ntasha, Pierre without any apparent cause sud- \ndenly felt it impossible to go on living as be- \nfore. Firmly convinced as he was of the truths \nrevealed to him by his benefactor, and happy \nas he had been in perfecting his inner man, to \nwhich he had devoted himself with such ardor \nall the zest of such a life vanished after the \nengagement of Andrew and Natasha and the \ndeath of Joseph Alexe'evich, the news of which \nreached him almost at the same time. Only the \nskeleton of life remained: his house, a brilliant \nwife who now enjoyed the favors of a very \nimportant personage, acquaintance with all \nPetersburg, and his court service with its dull \nformalities. And this life suddenly seemed to \nPierre unexpectedly loathsome. He ceased keep- \ning a diary, avoided the company of the Broth- \ners, began going to the Club again, drank a \ngreat deal, and came once more in touch with \nthe bachelor sets, leading such a life that the \nCountess Hdlene thought it necessary to speak \nseverely to him about it. Pierre felt that she was \nright, and to avoid compromising her went \naway to Moscow. \n\nIn Moscow as soon as he entered his huge \nhouse in which the faded and fading princesses \nstill lived, with its enormous retinue; as soon \nas, driving through the town, he saw the Iberi- \nan shrine with innumerable tapers burning be- \nfore the golden covers of the icons, the Kremlin \nSquare with its snow undisturbed by vehicles, \nthe sleigh drivers and hovels of the Sivtsev \nVrazh6k, those old Moscovites who desired \nnothing, hurried nowhere, and were ending \ntheir days leisurely; when he saw those old \nMoscow ladies, the Moscow balls, and the Eng- \nlish Club, he felt himself at home in a quiet \nhaven. In Moscow he felt at peace, at home, \nwarm and dirty as in an old dressing gown. \n\nMoscow society, from the old women down \nto the children, received Pierre like a long- \nexpected guest whose place was always ready \nawaiting him. For Moscow society Pierre was \n\n\n\nthe nicest, kindest, most intellectual, merriest, \nand most magnanimous of cranks, a heedless, \ngenial nobleman of the old Russian type. His \npurse was always empty because it was open to \neveryone. \n\nBenefit performances, poor pictures, statues, \nbenevolent societies, gypsy choirs, schools, sub- \nscription dinners, sprees, Freemasons, church- \nes, and books no one and nothing met with a \nrefusal from him, and had it not been for two \nfriends who had borrowed large sums from \nhim and taken him under their protection, he \nwould have given everything away. There was \nnever a dinner or soiree at the Club without \nhim. As soon as he sank into his place on the \nsofa after two bottles of Margaux he was sur- \nrounded, and talking, disputing, and joking \nbegan. When there were quarrels, his kindly \nsmile and well-timed jests reconciled the antag- \nonists. The Masonic dinners were dull and \ndreary when he was not there. \n\nWhen after a bachelor supper he rose with \nhis amiable and kindly smile, yielding to the \nentreaties of the festive company to drive off \nsomewhere with them, shouts of delight and \ntriumph arose among the young men. At balls \nhe danced if a partner was needed. Young la- \ndies, married and unmarried, liked him be- \ncause without making love to any of them, he \nwas equally amiable to all, especially after sup- \nper. "// est charmant; il n'a pas de sexe," * they \nsaid of him. \n\nPierre was one of those retired gentlemen- \nin-waiting of whom there were hundreds good- \nhumoredly ending their days in Moscow. \n\nHow horrified he would have been seven \nyears before, when he first arrived from abroad, \nhad he been told that there was no need for \nhim to seek or plan anything, that his rut had \nlong been shaped, eternally predetermined, \nand that wriggle as he might, he would be what \nall in his position were. He could not have be- \nlieved itl Had he not at one time longed with \nall his heart to establish a republic in Russia; \n\n1 "He is charming; he has no sex." \n\n\n\n33 \n\n\n\n34 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nthen himself to be a Napoleon; then to be a \nphilosopher; and then a strategist and the con- \nqueror of Napoleon? Had he not seen the pos- \nsibility of, and passionately desired, the regen- \neration of the sinful human race, and his own \nprogress to the highest degree of perfection? \nHad he not established schools and hospitals \nand liberated his serfs? \n\nBut instead of all thathere he was, the \nwealthy husband of an unfaithful wife, a re- \ntired gentleman-in-waiting, fond of eating and \ndrinking and, as he unbuttoned his waistcoat, \nof abusing the government a bit, a member of \nthe Moscow English Club, and a universal fa- \nvorite in Moscow society. For a long time he \ncould not reconcile himself to the idea that he \nwas one of those same retired Moscow gentle- \nmen-in-waiting he had so despised seven years \nbefore. \n\nSometimes he consoled himself with the \nthought that he was only living this life tem- \nporarily; but then he was shocked by the \nthought of how many, like himself, had en- \ntered that life and that Club temporarily, with \nall their teeth and hair, and had only left it \nwhen not a single tooth or hair remained. \n\nIn moments of pride, when he thought of his \nposition it seemed to him that he was quite \ndifferent and distinct from those other retired \ngentlemen-in-waiting he had formerly de- \nspised: they were empty, stupid, contented fel- \nlows, satisfied with their position, "while I am \nstill discontented and want to do something \nfor mankind. But perhaps all these comrades \nof minestruggled just like me and sought some- \nthing new, a path in life of their own, and like \nme were brought by force of circumstances, so- \nciety, and race by that elemental force against \nwhich man is powerless to the condition I am \nin," said he to himself in moments of humility; \nand after living some time in Moscow he no \nlonger despised, but began to grow fond of, to \nrespect, and to pity his comrades in destiny, as \nhe pitied himself. \n\nPierre no longer suffered moments of despair, \nhypochondria, and disgust with life, but the \nmalady that had formerly found expression in \nsuch acute attacks was driven inwards and nev- \ner left him for a moment. "What for? Why? \nWhat is going on in the world?" he would ask \nhimself in perplexity several times a day, in- \nvoluntarily beginning to reflect anew on the \nmeaning of the phenomena of life; but know- \ning by experience that there were no answers \nto these questions he made haste to turn away \nfrom them, and took up a book, or hurried off \n\n\n\nto the Club or to Apoll6n Nikoldevich's, to \nexchange the gossip of the town. \n\n"Hlne, who has never cared for anything \nbut her own body and is one of the stupidest \nwomen in the world," thought Pierre, "is re- \ngarded by people as the acme of intelligence \nand refinement, and they pay homage to her. \nNapoleon Bonaparte was despised by all as \nlong as he was great, but now that he has be- \ncome a wretched comedian the Emperor Fran- \ncis wants to offer him his daughter in an illegal \nmarriage. The Spaniards, thro ugh the Catholic \nclergy, offer praise to God for their victory over \nthe French on the fourteenth of June, and the \nFrench, also through the Catholic clergy, offer \npraise because on that same fourteenth of \nJune they defeated the Spaniards. My brother \nMasons swear by the blood that they are ready \nto sacrifice everything for their neighbor, but \nthey do not give a ruble each to the collections \nfor the poor, and they intrigue, the Astraea \nLodge against the Manna Seekers, and fuss \nabout an authentic Scotch carpet and a charter \nthat nobody needs, and the meaning of which \nthe very man who wrote it does not understand. \nWe all profess the Christian law of forgiveness \nof injuries and love of our neighbors, the law \nin honor of which we have built in Moscow \nforty times forty churches but yesterday a de- \nserter was knouted to death and a minister of \nthat same law of love and forgiveness, a priest, \ngave the soldier a cross to kiss before his exe- \ncution." So thought Pierre, and the whole of \nthis general deception which everyone accepts, \naccustomed as he was to it, astonished him each \ntime as if it were something new. "I under- \nstand the deception and confusion," he \nthought, "but how am I to tell them all that I \nsee? I have tried, and have always found that \nthey too in the depths of their souls under- \nstand it as I do, and only try not to see it. So \nit appears that it must be so! But Iwhat is to \nbecome of me?" thought he. He had the unfor- \ntunate capacity many men, especially Russians, \nhave of seeing and believing in the possibility \nof goodness and truth, but of seeing the evil \nand falsehood of life too clearly to be able to \ntake a serious part in it. Every sphere of work \nwas connected, in his eyes, with evil and decep- \ntion. Whatever he tried to be, whatever he en- \ngaged in, the evil and falsehood of it repulsed \nhim and blocked every path of activity. Yet he \nhad to live and to find occupation. It was too \ndreadful to be under the burden of these in- \nsoluble problems, so he abandoned himself to \nany distraction in order to forget them. He \n\n\n\nBOOK EIGHT \n\n\n\n35 \n\n\n\nfrequented every kind of society, drank much, \nbought pictures, engaged in building, and \nabove allread. \n\nHe read, and read everything that came to \nhand. On coming home, while his valets were \nstill taking off his things, he picked up a book \nand began to read. From reading he passed to \nsleeping, from sleeping to gossip in drawing \nrooms of the Club, from gossip to carousals and \nwomen; from carousals back to gossip, reading, \nand wine. Drinking became more and more a \nphysical and also a moral necessity. Though \nthe doctors warned him that with his corpu- \nlence wine was dangerous for him, he drank a \ngreat deal. He was only quite at ease when \nhaving poured several glasses of wine mechan- \nically into his large mouth he felt a pleasant \nwarmth in his body, an amiability toward all \nhis fellows, and a readiness to respond super- \nficially to every idea without probing it deep- \nly. Only after emptying a bottle or two did he \nfeel dimly that the terribly tangled skein of \nlife which previously had terrified him was not \nas dreadful as he had thought. He was always \nconscious of some aspect of that skein, as with \na buz/ing in his head after dinner or supper he \nchatted or listened to conversation or read. But \nunder the influence of wine he said to himself: \n"It doesn't matter. I'll get it unraveled. I have \na solution ready, but have no time now I'll \nthink it all out later onl" But the later on \nnever came. \n\nIn the morning, on an empty stomach, all \nthe old questions appeared as insoluble and \nterrible as ever, and Pierre hastily picked up \na book, and if anyone came to see him he was \nglad. \n\nSometimes he remembered how he had heard \nthat soldiers in war when entrenched under \nthe enemy's fire, if they have nothing to do, try \nhard to find some occupation the more easily \nto bear the danger. To Pierre all men seemed \nlike those soldiers, seeking refuge from life: \nsome in ambition, some in cards, some in fram- \ning laws, some in women, some in toys, some \nin horses, some in politics, some in sport, some \nin wine, and some in governmental affairs. \n"Nothing is trivial, and nothing is important, \nit's all the same only to save oneself from it as \nbest one can," thought Pierre. "Only not to see \nit, that dreadful it!" \n\nCHAPTER II \n\nAT THE BEGINNING OF WINTER Prince Nicholas \nBolk6nski and his daughter moved to Moscow. \nAt that time enthusiasm for the Emperor Alex- \n\n\n\nander's regime had weakened and a patriotic \nand anti-French tendency prevailed there, and \nthis, togetherwith his past and his intellect and \nhis originality, at once made Prince Nicholas \nBolkcmski an object of particular respect to \nthe Moscovites and the center of the Moscow \nopposition to the government. \n\nThe prince had aged very much that year. \nHe showed marked signs of senility by a tend- \nency to fall asleep, forgetfulness of quite re- \ncent events, remembrance of remote ones, and \nthe childish vanity with which he accepted the \nrole of head of the Moscow opposition. In \nspite of this the old man inspired in all his \nvisitors alike a feeling of respectful veneration \nespecially of an evening when he came in to \ntea in his old-fashioned coat and powdered \nwig and, aroused by anyone, told his abrupt \nstories of the past, or uttered yet more abrupt \nand scathing criticisms of the present. For them \nall, that old-fashioned house with its gigantic \nmirrors, pre-Revolution furniture, powdered \nfootmen, and the stern shrewd old man (him- \nself a relic of the past century) with his gentle \ndaughter and the pretty Frenchwoman who \nwere reverently devoted to him presented a \nmajestic and agreeable spectacle. But the visi- \ntors did not reflect that besides the couple of \nhours during which they saw their host, there \nwere also twenty-two hours in the day during \nwhich the private and intimate lifeof the house \ncontinued. \n\nLatterly that private life had become very \ntrying for Princess Mary. There in Moscow she \nwas deprived of her greatest pleasures talks \nwith the pilgrims and the solitude which re- \nfreshed her at Bald Hills and she had none of \nthe advantages and pleasures of city life. She \ndid not go out into society; everyone knew \nthat her father would not let her go anywhere \nwithout him, and his failing health prevented \nhis going out himself, so that she was not in- \nvited to dinners and evening parties. She had \nquite abandoned the hope of getting married. \nShe saw the coldness and malevolence with \nwhich the old prince received and dismissed \nthe young men, possible suitors, who some- \ntimes appeared at their house. She had no \nfriends: during this visit to Moscow she had \nbeen disappointed in the two who had been \nnearest to her. Mademoiselle Bourienne, with \nwhom she had never been able to be quite \nfrank, had now become unpleasant to her, and \nfor various reasons Princess Mary avoided her. \nJulie, with whom she had corresponded for \nthe last five years, was in Moscow, but proved \n\n\n\n306 WAR AND PEACE \n\nto be quite alien to her when they met. Just \nthen Julie, who by the death of her brothers \nhad become one of the richest heiresses in Mos- \ncow, was in the full whirl of society pleasures. \nShe was surrounded by young men who, she \nfancied, had suddenly learned to appreciate \nher worth. Julie was at that stage in the life of \na society woman when she feels that her last \nchance of marrying has come and that her fate \nmust be decided now or never. On Thursdays \nPrincess Mary remembered with a mournful \nsmile that she now had no one to write to, since \nJulie whose presence gave her no pleasure- \nwas here and they met every week. Like the old \nemigrd who declined to marry the lady with \nwhom he had spent his evenings for years, she \nregretted Julie's presence and having no one to \nwrite to. In Moscow Princess Mary had no one \nto talk to, no one to whom to confide her sor- \nrow, and much sorrow fell to her lot just then. \nThe time for Prince Andrew's return and mar- \nriage was approaching, but his request to her \nto prepare his father for it had not been car- \nried out; in fact, it seemed as if matters were \nquite hopeless, for at every mention of the \nyoung Countess Rost6va the old prince (who \napart from that was usually in a bad temper) \nlost control of himself. Another lately added \nsorrow arose from the lessons she gave her six- \nyear-old nephew. To her consternation she \ndetected in herself in relation to little Nich- \nolas some symptoms of her father's irritability. \nHowever often she told herself that she must \nnot get irritable when teaching her nephew, \nalmost every time that, pointer in hand, she \nsat down to show him the French alphabet, \nshe so longed to pour her own knowledge \nquickly and easily into the child who was al- \nready afraid that Auntie might at any moment \nget angry that at his slightest inattention she \ntrembled, became flustered and heated, raised \nher voice, and sometimes pulled him by the \narm and put him in the corner. Having put \nhim in the corner she would herself begin to \ncry over her cruel, evil nature, and little Nicho- \nlas, following her example, would sob, and \nwithout permission would leave his corner, \ncome to her, pull her wet hands from her face, \nand comfort her. But what distressed the prin- \ncess most of all was her father's irritability, \nwhich was always directed against her and had \nof late amounted to cruelty. Had he forced her \nto prostrate herself to the ground all night, \nhad he beaten her or made her fetch wood or \nwater, it would never have entered her mind \nto think her position hard; but this loving des- \n\n\n\npotthe more cruel because he loved her and \nfor that reason tormented himself and her \nknew how not merely to hurt and humiliate \nher deliberately, but to show her that she was \nalways to blame for everything. Of late he had \nexhibited a new trait that tormented Princess \nMary more than anything else; this was his \never-increasing intimacy with Mademoiselle \nBourienne. The idea that at the first moment \nof receiving the news of his son's intentions \nhad occurred to him in jest that if Andrew \ngot married he himself would marry Bouri- \nenne had evidently pleased him, and latterly \nhe had persistently, and as it seemed to Prin- \ncess Mary merely to offend her, shown special \nendearments to the companion and expressed \nhis dissatisfaction with his daughter by demon- \nstrations of love of Bourienne. \n\nOne day in Moscow in Princess Mary's pres- \nence (she thought her father did it purposely \nwhen she was there) the old prince kissed Made- \nmoiselle Bourienne's hand and, drawing hereto \nhim, embraced her affectionately. Princess Mary \nflushed and ran out of the room. A few min- \nutes later Mademoiselle Bourienne came into \nPrincess Mary's room smiling and making \ncheerful remarks in her agreeable voice. Prin- \ncess Mary hastily wiped away her tears, went \nresolutely up to Mademoiselle Bourienne, \nand evidently unconscious of what she \nwas doing began shouting in angry haste \nat the Frenchwoman, her voice breaking: \n"It's horrible, vile, inhuman, to take advan- \ntage of the weakness . . ." She did not finish. \n"Leave my room," she exclaimed, and burst \ninto sobs. \n\nNext day the prince did not say a word to \nhis daughter, but she noticed that at dinner he \ngave orders that Mademoiselle Bourienne \nshould be served first. After dinner, when the \nfootman handed coffee and from habit began \nwith the princess, the prince suddenly grew \nfurious, threw his stick at Philip, and instantly \ngave instructions to have him conscripted for \nthe army. \n\n"He doesn't obey ... I said it twice . . . and \nhe doesn't obey! She is the first person in this \nhouse; she's my best friend," cried the prince. \n"And if you allow yourself," he screamed in a \nfury, addressing Princess Mary for the first \ntime, "to forget yourself again before her as \nyou dared to do yesterday, I will show you who \nis master in this house. Go! Don't let me set \neyes on you; beg her pardon!" \n\nPrincess Mary asked Mademoiselle Bouri- \nenne's pardon, and also her father's pardon \n\n\n\nBOOK EIGHT \n\n\n\nfor herself and for Philip the footman, who \nhad begged for her intervention. \n\nAt such moments something like a pride of \nsacrifice gathered in her soul. And suddenly \nthat father whom she had judged would look \nfor his spectacles in her presence, fumbling \nnear them and not seeing them, or would for- \nget something that had just occurred, or take \na false step with his failing legs and turn to see \nif anyone had noticed his feebleness, or, worst \nof all, at dinner when there were no visitors to \nexcite him would suddenly fall asleep, letting \nhis napkin drop and his shaking head sink \nover his plate. "He is old and feeble, and I \ndare to condemn him!" she thought at such \nmoments, with a feeling of revulsion against \nherself. \n\nCHAPTER III \n\nIN 1811 there was living in Moscow a French \ndoctor Me* tivier who had rapidly become the \nfashion. He was enormously tall, handsome, \namiable as Frenchmen are, and was, as all Mos- \ncow said, an extraordinarily clever doctor. He \nwas received in the best houses not merely as a \ndoctor, but as an equal. \n\nPrince Nicholas had always ridiculed medi- \ncine, but latterly on Mademoiselle Bourienne's \nadvice had allowed this doctor to visit him and \nhad grown accustomed to him. Me*tivier came \nto see the prince about twice a week. \n\nOn December 6 St. Nicholas* Day and the \nprince's name day all Moscow came to the \nprince's front door but he gave orders to ad- \nmit no one and to invite to dinner only a small \nnumber, a list of whom he gave to Princess \nMary. \n\nMdtivier, who came in the morning with his \nfelicitations, considered it proper in his quality \nof doctor de forcer la consigned as he told Prin- \ncess Mary, and went in to see the prince. It \nhappened that on that morning of his name \nday the prince was in one of his worst moods. \nHe had been going about the house all the \nmorning finding fault with everyone and pre- \ntending not to understand what was said to \nhim and not to be understood himself. Prin- \ncess Mary well knew this mood of quiet ab- \nsorbed querulousness, which generally culmi- \nnated in a burst of rage, and she went about all \nthat morning as though facing a cocked and \nloaded gun and awaited the inevitable explo- \nsion. Until the doctor's arrival the morning \nhad passed off safely. After admitting the doc- \ntor, Princess Mary sat down with a book in the \n\n1 To force the guard. \n\n\n\ndrawing room near the door through which \nshe could hear all that passed in the study. \n\nAt first she heard only Me* tivier's voice, then \nher father's, then both voices began speaking \nat the same time, the door was flung open, and \non the threshold appeared the handsome figure \nof the terrified MeHivierwith his shock of black \nhair, and the prince in his dressing gown and \nfez, his face distorted with fury and the pupils \nof his eyes rolled downwards. \n\n"You don't understand?" shouted the prince, \n"but I do! French spy, slave of Buonaparte, \nspy, get out of my house! Be off, I tell you . . ." \nand he slammed the door. \n\nMdtivier, shrugging his shoulders, went up to \nMademoiselle Bourienne who at the sound of \nshouting had run in from an adjoining room. \n\n"The prince is not very well: bile and rush \nof blood to the head. Keep calm, I will call \nagain tomorrow," said Mdtivier; and putting \nhis fingers to his lips he hastened away. \n\nThrough the study door came the sound of \nslippered feet and the cry: "Spies, traitors, \ntraitors everywhere! Not a moment's peace in \nmy own house!" \n\nAfter Me*tivier's departure the old prince \ncalled his daughter in, and the whole weight \nof his wrath fell on her. She was to blame that \na spy had been admitted. Had he not told her, \nyes, told her to make a list, and not to admit \nanyone who was not on that list? Then why \nwas that scoundrel admitted? She was the cause \nof it all. With her, he said, he could not have a \nmoment's peace and could not die quietly. \n\n"No, ma'am! We must part, we must part! \nUnderstand that, understand it! I cannot en- \ndure any more," he said, and left the room. \nThen, as if afraid she might find some means \nof consolation, he returned and trying to ap- \npear calm added: "And don't imagine I have \nsaid this in a moment of anger. I am calm, I \nhave thought it over, and it will be carried out \nwe must part; so find some place for your- \nself I . . ." But he could not restrain himself and \nwith the virulence of which only one who \nloves is capable, evidently suffering himself, \nhe shook his fists at her and screamed: \n\n"If only some fool would marry her!" Then \nhe slammed the door, sent for Mademoiselle \nBourienne, and subsided into his study. \n\nAt two o'clock the six chosen guests assem- \nbled for dinner. \n\nThese guests the famous Count Rostop- \nchin, Prince Lopukhfn with his nephew, Gen- \neral Chatrov an old war comrade of the prince's, \nand of the younger generation Pierre and \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nBoris Drubetsk6y awaited the prince in the \ndrawing room. \n\nBoris, who had come to Moscow on leave a \nfew days before, had been anxious to be pre- \nsented to Prince Nicholas Bolk6nski, and had \ncontrived to ingratiate himself so well that the \nold prince in his case made an exception to the \nrule of not receiving bachelors in his house. \n\nThe prince's house did not belong to what is \nknown as fashionable society, but his little cir- \nclethough not much talked about in town- \nwas one it was more flattering to be received in \nthan any other. Boris had realized this the \nweek before when the commander in chief in \nhis presence invited Rostopchin to dinner on \nSt. Nicholas' Day, and Rostopchin had replied \nthat he could not come: \n\n"On that day I always go to pay my devo- \ntions to the relics of Prince Nicholas Bolk6n- \nski." \n\n"Oh, yes, yes!" replied the commander in \nchief. "How is he? . . ." \n\nThe small group that assembled before din- \nner in the lofty old-fashioned drawing room \nwith its old furniture resembled the solemn \ngathering of a court of justice. All were silent \nor talked in low tones. Prince Nicholas came \nin serious and taciturn. Princess Mary seemed \neven quieter and more diffident than usual. \nThe guests were reluctant to address her, feel- \ning that she was in no mood for their conversa- \ntion. Count Rostopchfn alone kept the con- \nversation going, now relating the latest town \nnews, and now the latest political gossip. \n\nLopukhin and the old general occasionally \ntook part in the conversation. Prince Bolk6n- \nski listened as a presiding judge receives a re- \nport, only now and then, silently or by a brief \nword, showing that he took heed of what was \nbeing reported to him. The tone of the con- \nversation was such as indicated that no one ap- \nproved of what was being done in the political \nworld. Incidents were related evidently con- \nfirming the opinion that everything was going \nfrom bad to worse, but whether telling a story \nor giving an opinion the speaker always \nstopped, or was stopped, at the point beyond \nwhich his criticism might touch the sovereign \nhimself. \n\nAt dinner the talk turned on the latest politi- \ncal news: Napoleon's seizure of the Duke of \nOldenburg's territory, and the Russian Note, \nhostile to Napoleon, which had been sent to \nall the European courts. \n\n"Bonaparte treats Europe as a pirate does a \ncaptured vessel/ 1 said Count Rostopchin, re- \n\n\n\npeating a phrase he had uttered several times \nbefore. "One only wonders at the long-suffer- \ning or blindness of the crowned heads. Now \nthe Pope's turn has come and Bonaparte doesn't \nscruple to depose the head of the Catholic \nChurchyet all keep silent! Our sovereign \nalone has protested against the seizure of the \nDuke of Oldenburg's territory, and even . . ." \nCount Rostopchin paused, feeling that he had \nreached the limit beyond which censure was \nimpossible. \n\n"Other territories have been offered in ex- \nchange for the Duchy of Oldenburg," said \nPrince Bolkonski. "He shifts the Dukes about \nas I might move my serfs from Bald Hills to \nBogucharovo or my Ryazan estates." \n\n"The Duke of Oldenburg bears his misfor- \ntunes with admirable strength of character and \nresignation," remarked Boris, joining in re- \nspectfully. \n\nHe said this because on his journey from \nPetersburg he had had the honor of being pre- \nsented to the Duke. Prince Bolkonski glanced \nat the young man as if about to say something \nin reply, but changed his mind, evidently con- \nsidering him too young. \n\n"I have read our protests about the Olden- \nburg affair and was surprised how badly the \nNote was worded," remarked Count Rostop- \nchin in the casual tone of a man dealing with \na subject quite familiar to him. \n\nPierre looked at Rostopchfn with nai've as- \ntonishment, not understanding why he should \nbe disturbed by the bad composition of the \nNote. \n\n"Does it matter, Count, how the Note is \nworded," he asked, "so long as its substance is \nforcible?" \n\n"My clear fellow, with our five hundred thou- \nsand troops it should be easy to have a good \nstyle," returned Count Rostopchin. \n\nPierre now understood the count's dissatis- \nfaction with the wording of the Note. \n\n"One would have thought quill drivers \nenough had sprung up," remarked the old \nprince. "There in Petersburg they are always \nwriting not notes only but even new laws. My \nAndrew there has written a whole volume of \nlaws for Russia. Nowadays they are always writ- \ning!" and he laughed unnaturally. \n\nThere was a momentary pause in the con- \nversation; the old general cleared his throat to \ndraw attention. \n\n"Did you hear of the last event at the review \nin Petersburg? The figure cut by the new \nFrench ambassador," \n\n\n\nBOOK EIGHT \n\n\n\n39 \n\n\n\n"Eh? Yes, I heard something: he said some- \nthing awkward in His Majesty's presence." \n\n"His Majesty drew attention to the Grena- \ndier division and to the march past," continued \nthe general, "and it seems the ambassador took \nno notice and allowed himself to reply that: \n'We in France pay no attention to such trifles!' \nThe Emperor did not condescend to reply. At \nthe next review, they say, the Emperor did not \nonce deign to address him." \n\nAll were silent. On this fact relating to the \nEmperor personally, it was impossible to pass \nany judgment. \n\n"Impudent fellows!" said the prince. "You \nknow Mtivier? I turned him out of my house \nthis morning. He was here; they admitted him \nin spite of my request that they should let no \none in," he went on, glancing angrily at his \ndaughter. \n\nAnd he narrated his whole conversation with \nthe French doctor and the reasons that con- \nvinced him that M^tivier was a spy. Though \nthese reasons were very insufficient and ob- \nscure, no one made any rejoinder. \n\nAfter the roast, champagne was served. The \nguests rose to congratulate the old prince. \nPrincess Mary, too, went round to him. \n\nHe gave her a cold, angry look and offered \nher his wrinkled, clean-shaven cheek to kiss. \nThe whole expression of his face told her that \nhe had not forgotten the morning's talk, that \nhis decision remained in force, and only the \npresence of visitors hindered his speaking of \nit to her now. \n\nWhen they went into the drawing room \nwhere coffee was served, the old men sat to- \ngether. \n\nPrince Nicholas grew more animated and \nexpressed his views on the impending war. \n\nHe said that our wars with Bonaparte would \nbe disastrous so long as we sought alliances \nwith the Germans and thrust ourselves into \nEuropean affairs, into which we had been \ndrawn by the Peace of Tilsit. "We ought not \nto fight either for or against Austria. Our po- \nlitical interests are all in the East, and in re- \ngard to Bonaparte the only thing is to have an \narmed frontier and a firm policy, and he will \nnever dare to cross the Russian frontier, as was \nthe case in 1807!" \n\n"How can we fight the French, Prince?" said \nCount Rostopchin. "Can we arm ourselves \nagainst our teachers and divinities? Look at \nour youths, look at our ladiesl The French \nare our Gods: Paris is our Kingdom of \nHeaven." \n\n\n\nHe began speaking louder, evidently to be \nheard by everyone. \n\n"French dresses, French ideas, French feel- \nings! There now, you turned M^tivier out by \nthe scruff of his neck because he is a French- \nman and a scoundrel, but our ladies crawl aft- \ner him on their knees. I went to a party last \nnight, and there out of five ladies three were \nRoman Catholics and had the Pope's indul- \ngence for doing woolwork on Sundays. And \nthey themselves sit there nearly naked, like the \nsignboards at our Public Baths if I may say so. \nAh, when one looks at our young people, Prince, \none would like to take Peter the Great's old \ncudgel out of the museum and belabor them in \nthe Russian way till all the nonsense jumps \nout of them." \n\nAll were silent. The old prince looked at Ros- \ntopchfn with a smile and wagged his head ap- \nprovingly. \n\n"Well, good-by, your excellency, keep well!" \nsaid Rostopchfn, getting up with characteristic \nbriskness and holding out his hand to the \nprince. \n\n"Good-by, my dear fellow His words are \n\nmusic, I never tire of hearing him!" said the \nold prince, keeping hold of the hand and of- \nfering his cheek to be kissed. \n\nFollowing Rostopchin's example the others \nalso rose. \n\nCHAPTER IV \n\nPRINCESS MARY, as she sat listening to the old \nmen's talk and faultfinding, understood noth- \ning of what she heard; she only wondered \nwhether the guests had all observed her fa- \nther's hostile attitude toward her. She did not \neven notice the special attentions and amiabil- \nities shown her during dinner by Boris Drubet- \nsk6y, who was visiting them for the third time \nalready. \n\nPrincess Mary turned with an absent-minded \nquestioning look to Pierre, who hat in hand \nand with a smile on his face was the last of the \nguests to approach her after the old prince had \ngone out and they were left alone in the draw- \ning room. \n\n"May I stay a little longer?" he said, letting \nhis stout body sink into an armchair beside her. \n\n"Oh yes," she answered. "You noticed noth- \ning?" her look asked. \n\nPierre was in an agreeable after-dinner mood. \nHe looked straight before him and smiled \nquietly. \n\n"Have you known that young man long, \nPrincess?" he asked \n\n\n\n310 \n\n"Who?" \n\n"Drubetsk6y." \n\n"No, not long. . . ." \n\n"Do you like him?" \n\n"Yes, he is an agreeable young man. . . . Why \ndo you ask me that?" said Princess Mary, still \nthinking of that morning's conversation with \nher father. \n\n"Because I have noticed that when a young \nman comes on leave from Petersburg to Mos- \ncow it is usually with the object of marrying \nan heiress." \n\n"You have observed that?" said Princess \nMary. \n\n"Yes," returned Pierre with a smile, "and \nthis young man now manages matters so that \nwhere there is a wealthy heiress there he is too. \nI can read him like a book. At present he is \nhesitating whom to lay siege to you or Made- \nmoiselle Julie Kardgina. He is very attentive \nto her." \n\n"He visits them?" \n\n"Yes, very often. And do you know the new \nway of courting?" said Pierre with an amused \nsmile, evidently in that cheerful mood of good- \nhumored raillery for which he so often re- \nproached himself in his diary. \n\n"No," replied Princess Mary. \n\n"To please Moscow girls nowadays one has \nto be melancholy. He is very melancholy with \nMademoiselle Karigina," said Pierre. \n\n"Really?" asked Princess Mary, looking into \nPierre's kindly face and still thinking of her \nown sorrow. "It would be a relief," thought \nshe, "if I ventured to confide what I am feeling \nto someone. I should like to tell everything to \nPierre. He is kind and generous. It would be a \nrelief. He would give me advice." \n\n"Would you marry him?" \n\n"Oh, my God, Count, there are moments \nwhen I would marry anybodyl" she cried sud- \ndenly to her own surprise and with tears in her \nvoice. "Ah, how bitter it is to love someone \nnear to you and to feel that . . ." she went on \nin a trembling voice, "that you can do nothing \nfor him but grieve him, and to know that you \ncannot alter this. Then there is only one thing \nleftto go away, but where could I go?" \n\n"What is wrong? What is it, Princess?" \n\nBut without finishing what she was saying, \nPrincess Mary burst into tears. \n\n"I don't know what is the matter with me \ntoday. Don't take any notice forget what I \nhave said!" \n\nPierre's gaiety vanished completely. He anx- \niously questioned the princess, asked her to \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\nspeak out fully and confide her grief to him; \n\n\n\nbut she only repeated that she begged him to \nforget what she had said, that she did not re- \nmember what she had said, and that she had \nno trouble except the one he knew ofthat \nPrince Andrew's marriage threatened to cause \na rupture between father and son. \n\n"Have you any news of the Rost6vs?" she \nasked, to change the subject. "I was told they \nare coming soon. I am also expecting Andrew \nany day. I should like them to meet here." \n\n"And how does he now regard the matter?" \nasked Pierre, referring to the old prince. \n\nPrincess Mary shook her head. \n\n"What is to be done? In a few months the \nyear will be up. The thing is impossible. I on- \nly wish I could spare my brother the first mo- \nments. I wish they would come sooner. I hope \nto be friends with her. You have known them \na long time," said Princess Mary. "Tell me \nhonestly the whole truth: what sort of girl is \nshe, and what do you think of her? The real \ntruth, because you know Andrew is risking so \nmuch doing this against his father's will that I \nshould like to know. . . ." \n\nAn undefined instinct told Pierre that these \nexplanations, and repeated requests to be told \nthe whole truth, expressed ill-will on the prin- \ncess' part toward her future sister-in-law and a \nwish that he should disapprove of Andrew's \nchoice; but in reply he said what he felt rather \nthan what he thought. \n\n"I don't know how to answer your ques- \ntion," he said, blushing without knowing why. \n"I really don't know what sort of girl she is; I \ncan't analyze her at all. She is enchanting, but \nwhat makes her so I don't know. That is all \none can say about her." \n\nPrincess Mary sighed, and the expression on \nher face said: "Yes, that's what I expected and \nfeared." \n\n"Is she clever?" she asked. \n\nPierre considered. \n\n"I think not," he said, "and yet yes. She \ndoes not deign to be clever. . . . Oh no, she is \nsimply enchanting, and that is all." \n\nPrincess Mary again shook her head disap- \nprovingly. \n\n"Ah, I so long to like her! Tell her so if you \nsee her before I do." \n\n"I hear they are expected very soon," said \nPierre. \n\nPrincess Mary told Pierre of her plan to be- \ncome intimate with her future sister-in-law as \nsoon as the Rostovs arrived and to try to ac- \ncustom the old prince to her. \n\n\n\nBOOK EIGHT \n\n\n\nCHAPTER V \n\nBORIS HAD NOT SUCCEEDED in making a wealthy \nmatch in Petersburg, so with the same object \nin view he came to Moscow. There he wavered \nbetween the two richest heiresses, Julie and \nPrincess Mary. Though Princess Mary despite \nher plainness seemed to him more attractive \nthan Julie, he, without knowing why, felt awk- \nward about paying court to her. When they \nhad last met on the old prince's name day, she \nhad answered at random all his attempts to \ntalk sentimentally, evidently not listening to \nwhat he was saying. \n\nJulie on the contrary accepted his attentions \nreadily, though in a manner peculiar to her- \nself. \n\nShe was twenty-seven. After the death of her \nbrothers she had become very wealthy. She was \nby now decidedly plain, but thought herself \nnot merely as good-looking as before but even \nfar more attractive. She was confirmed in this \ndelusion by the fact that she had become a \nvery wealthy heiress and also by the fact that \nthe older she grew the less dangerous she be- \ncame to men, and the more freely they could \nassociate with her and avail themselves of her \nsuppers, soirees, and the animated company \nthat assembled at her house, without incurring \nany obligation. A man who would have been \nafraid ten years before of going every day to \nthe house when there was a girl of seventeen \nthere, for fear of compromising her and com- \nmitting himself, would now go boldly every \nday and treat her not as a marriageable girl \nbut as a sexless acquaintance. \n\nThat winter the Kardgins' house was the \nmost agreeable and hospitable in Moscow. In \naddition to the formal evening and dinner \nparties, a large company, chiefly of men, gath- \nered there every day, supping at midnight \nand staying till three in the morning. Julie \nnever missed a ball, a promenade, or a play. \nHer dresses were always of the latest fashion. \nBut in spite of that she seemed to be disillu- \nsioned about everything and told everyone \nthat she did not believe either in friendship or \nin love, or any of the joys of life, and expected \npeace only "yonder." She adopted the tone of \none who has suffered a great disappointment, \nlike a girl who has either lost the man she loved \nor been cruelly deceived by him. Though noth- \ning of the kind had happened to her she was \nregarded in that light, and had even herself \ncome to believe that she had suffered much in \nlife. This melancholy, which did not prevent \nher amusing herself, did not hinder the young \n\n\n\npeople who came to her house from passing \nthe time pleasantly. Every visitor who came to \nthe house paid his tribute to the melancholy \nmood of the hostess, and then amused himself \nwith society gossip, dancing, intellectual games, \nand bouts rimts? which were in vogue at the \nKardgins'. Only a few of these young men, \namong them Boris, entered more deeply into \nJulie's melancholy, and with these she had pro- \nlonged conversations in private on the vanity \nof all worldly things, and to them she showed \nher albums filled with mournful sketches, max- \nims, and verses. \n\nTo Boris, Julie was particularly gracious: \nshe regretted his early disillusionment with \nlife, offered him such consolation of friendship \nas she who had herself suffered so much could \nrender, and showed him her album. Boris \nsketched two trees in the album and wrote: \n"Rustic trees, your dark branches shed gloom \nand melancholy upon me." \n\nOn another page he drewa tomb, and wrote: \n\nLa mort est sec our able et la mort est tranquille. \nAh! contre les douleurs il n'y a pas d'autre asile.* \n\nJulia said this was charming. \n\n"There is something so enchanting in the \nsmile of melancholy," she said to Boris, repeat- \ning word for word a passage she had copied \nfrom a book. "It is a ray of light in the dark- \nness, a shade between sadness and despair, \nshowing the possibility of consolation." \n\nIn reply Boris wrote these lines: \n\nAliment de poison d'une dine trop sensible, \nToi, sans qui le bonheur me serait impossible, \nTendre me'lancholie, ah, viens me consoler, \nViens calmer les tourments de ma sombre retraite, \nEt mile une douceur secrete \nA ces pleurs que je sens couler. 3 \n\nFor Boris, Julie played most doleful noc- \nturnes on her harp. Boris read Poor Liza aloud \nto her, and more than once interrupted the \nreading because of the emotions that choked \nhim. Meeting at large gatherings Julie and \n\n*A game in which rhymes were given to the \nplayers, to which they had to fit lines making up \na verse. TR. \n8 Death gives relief and death is peaceful. \n\nAh! from suffering there is no other refuge. \n8 Poisonous nourishment of a too sensitive soul, \nThou, without whom happiness would for me \n\nbe impossible, \n\nTender melancholy, ah, come to console me, \nCome to calm the torments of my gloomy re- \ntreat, \n\nAnd mingle a secret sweetness \nWith these tears that I feel to be flowing. \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nBoris looked on one another as the only souls \nwho understood one another in a world of in- \ndifferent people. \n\nAnna Mikhdylovna, who often visited the \nKarigins, while playing cards with the mother \nmade careful inquiries as to Julie's dowry (she \nwas to have two estates in P&lt;*nza and the Niz- \nheg6rod forests). Anna Mikhdylovna regarded \nthe refined sadness that united her son to the \nwealthy Julie with emotion, and resignation \nto the Divine will. \n\n"You are always charming and melancholy, \nmy dear Julie," she said to the daughter. "Boris \nsays his soul finds repose at your house. He has \nsuffered so many disappointments and is so \nsensitive," said she to the mother. "Ah, my \ndear, I can't tell you how fond I have grown of \nJulie latterly," she said to her son. "But who \ncould help loving her? She is an angelic be- \ning! Ah, Boris, Boris!" she paused. "And how \nI pity her mother," she went on; "today she \nshowed me her accounts and letters from Pe*n- \nza (they have enormous estates there), and she, \npoor thing, has no one to help her, and they \ndo cheat her so!" \n\nBoris smiled almost imperceptibly while lis- \ntening to his mother. He laughed blandly at \nher naive diplomacy but listened to what she \nhad to say, and sometimes questioned her care- \nfully about the Pnza and Nizheg6rod estates. \n\nJulie had long been expecting a proposal \nfrom her melancholy adorer and was ready to \naccept it; but some secret feeling of repulsion \nfor her, for her passionate desire to get mar- \nried, for her artificiality, and a feeling of horror \nat renouncing the possibility of real love still \nrestrained Boris. His leave was expiring. He \nspent every day and whole days at the Kard- \ngins', and every day on thinking the matter \nover told himself that he would propose to- \nmorrow. But in Julie's presence, looking at her \nred face and chin (nearly always powdered), \nher moist eyes, and her expression of continual \nreadiness to pass at once from melancholy to \nan unnatural rapture of married bliss, Boris \ncould not utter the decisive words, though in \nimagination he had long regarded himself as \nthe possessor of those Pe*nza and Nizheg6rod \nestates and had apportioned the use of the in- \ncome from them. Julie saw Boris* indecision, \nand sometimes the thought occurred to her \nthat she was repulsive to him, but her feminine \nself-deception immediately supplied her with \nconsolation, and she told herself that he was \nonly shy from love. Her melancholy, however, \nbegan to turn to irritability, and not long be- \n\n\n\nfore Boris' departure she formed a definite plan \nof action. Just as Boris' leave of absence was \nexpiring, Anatole Kuragin made his appear- \nance in Moscow, and of course in the Kargins' \ndrawing room, and Julie, suddenly abandon- \ning her melancholy, became cheerful and very \nattentive to Kurdgin. \n\n"My dear," said Anna Mikhdylovna to her \nson, "I know from a reliable source that Prince \nVasili has sent his son to Moscow to get him \nmarried to Julie. I am so fond of Julie that I \nshould be sorry for her. What do you think of \nit, my dear?" \n\nThe idea of being made a fool of and of hav- \ning thrown away that whole month of arduous \nmelancholy service to Julie, and of seeing all \nthe revenue from the Pe*nza estates which he \nhad already mentally apportioned and put to \nproper use fall into the hands of another, and \nespecially into the hands of that idiot Anatole, \npained Boris. He drove to the Karagins' with \nthe firm intention of proposing. Julie met him \nin a gay, careless manner, spoke casually of \nhow she had enjoyed yesterday's ball, and asked \nwhen he was leaving. Though Boris had come \nintentionally to speak of his love and therefore \nmeant to be tender, he began speaking irrita- \nbly of feminine inconstancy, of how easily wom- \nen can turn from sadness to joy, and how their \nmoods depend solely on who happens to be \npaying court to them. Julie was offended and \nreplied that it was true that a woman needs \nvariety, and the same thing over and over again \nwould weary anyone. \n\n"Then I should advise you . . ." Boris began, \nwishing to sting her; but at that instant the \ngalling thought occurred to him that he might \nhave to leave Moscow without having accom- \nplished his aim, and have vainly wasted his ef- \nfortswhich was a thing he never allowed to \nhappen. \n\nHe checked himself in the middle of the \nsentence, lowered his eyes to avoid seeing her \nunpleasantly irritated and irresolute face, and \nsaid: \n\n"I did not come here at all to quarrel with \nyou. On the contrary . . ." \n\nHe glanced at her to make sure that he might \ngo on. Her irritability had suddenly quite van- \nished, and her anxious, imploring eyes were \nfixed on him with greedy expectation. "I can \nalways arrange so as not to see her often," \nthought Boris. "The affair has been begun and \nmust be finished!" He blushed hotly, raised his \neyes to hers, and said: \n\n"You know my feelings for you!" \n\n\n\nBOOK EIGHT \n\n\n\nThere was no need to say more: Julie's face \nshone with triumph and self-satisfaction; but \nshe forced Boris to say all that is said on such \noccasions that he loved her and had never \nloved any other woman more than her. She \nknew that for the P^nza estates and Nizheg6- \nrod forests she could demand this, and she re- \nceived what she demanded. \n\nThe affianced couple, no longer alluding to \ntrees that shed gloom and melancholy upon \nthem, planned the arrangements of a splendid \nhouse in Petersburg, paid calls, and prepared \neverything for a brilliant wedding. \n\nCHAPTER VI \n\nAT THE END OF jANUARYoldCount Rost6vwent \nto Moscow with Natasha and Sonya. The count- \ness was still unwell and unable to travel but it \nwas impossible to wait for her recovery. Prince \nAndrew was expected in Moscow any day, the \ntrousseau had to be ordered and the estate near \nMoscow had to be sold, besides which the op- \nportunity of presenting his future daughter-in- \nlaw to old Prince Bolk6nski while he was in \nMoscow could not be missed. The Rostovs' \nMoscow house had not been heated that winter \nand, as they had come only for a short time \nand the countess was not with them, the count \ndecided to stay with Marya Dmitrievna Akhro- \nsimova, who had long been pressing her hospi- \ntality on them. \n\nLate one evening the Rostovs' four sleighs \ndrove into Marya Dmitrievna's courtyard in \nthe old Konyusheny street. Marya Dmitrievna \nlived alone. She had already married off her \ndaughter, and her sons were all in the service. \n\nShe held herself as erect, told everyone her \nopinion as candidly, loudly, and bluntly as ev- \ner, and her whole bearing seemed a reproach \nto others for any weakness, passion, or tempta- \ntionthe possibilityof which shedid riotadmit. \nFrom early in the morning, wearing a dressing \njacket, she attended to her household affairs, \nand then she drove out: on holy days to church \nand after the service to jails and prisons on \naffairs of which she never spoke to anyone. On \nordinary days, after dressing, she received peti- \ntioners of various classes, of whom there were \nalways some. Then she had dinner, a substan- \ntial and appetizing meal at which there were \nalways three or four guests; after dinner she \nplayed a game of boston, and at night she had \nthe newspapers or a new book read to her while \nshe knitted. She rarely made an exception and \nwent out to pay visits, and then only to the \nmost important persons in the town. \n\n\n\nShe had not yet gone to bed when the Ros- \nt6vs arrived and the pulley of the hall door \nsqueaked from the cold as it let in the Rost6vs \nand their servants. Mdrya Dmitrievna, with her \nspectacles hanging down on her nose and her \nhead flung back, stood in the hall doorway \nlooking with a stern, grim face at the new ar- \nrivals. One might have thought she was angry \nwith the travelers and would immediately turn \nthem out, had she not at the same time been \ngiving careful instructions to the servants for \nthe accommodation of the visitors and their be- \nlongings. \n\n"The count's things? Bring them here/' she \nsaid, pointing to the portmanteaus and not \ngreeting anyone. "The young ladies'? There to \nthe left. Now what are you dawdling for?" she \ncried to the maids. "Get the samovar ready! . . . \nYou've grown plumper and prettier," she re- \nmarked, drawing Natasha (whose cheeks were \nglowing from the cold) to her by the hood. \n"Fool You are coldl Now take off your things, \nquick 1" she shouted to the count who was go- \ning to kiss her hand. "You're half frozen, I'm \nsure! Bring some rum for teal . . . Bon jour, S6n- \nya dear!" she added, turning to Sonya and in- \ndicating by this French greeting her slightly \ncontemptuous though affectionate attitude to- \nward her. \n\nWhen they came in to tea, having taken off \ntheir outdoor things and tidied themselves up \nafter their journey, Marya Dmitrievna kissed \nthem all in due order. \n\n"I'm heartily glad you have come and are \nstaying with me. It was high time," she said, \ngiving Natasha a significant look. "The old \nman is here and his son's expected any day. \nYou'll have to make his acquaintance. But we'll \nspeak of that later on," she added, glancing at \nS6nya with a look that showed she did not want \nto speak of it in her presence. "Now listen, "she \nsaid to the count. "What do you want tomor- \nrow? Whom will you send for? Shinshin?" she \ncrooked one of her fingers. "The sniveling An- \nna Mikhaylovna? That's two. She's here with \nher son. The son is getting married! Then Be- \nzukhov, eh? He is here too, with his wife. He \nran away from her and she came galloping aft- \ner him. He dined with me on Wednesday. As \nfor them" and she pointed to the girls "to- \nmorrowl'll take them first to the Iberianshrine \nof the Mother of God, and then we'll drive to \nthe Super-Rogue's. 1 1 suppose you'll have ev- \nerything new. Don't judge by me: sleeves \n\n1 A pun on Suppert-Roguet, the dressmaker's \nname. TR. \n\n\n\n3*4 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nnowadays are this sizel The other day young \nPrincess Irina Vasflevna came to see me; she \nwas an awful sightlooked as if she had put \ntwo barrels on her arms. You know not a day \n\npasses now without some new fashion And \n\nwhat have you to do yourself?" she asked the \ncount sternly. \n\n"One thing has come on top of another: her \nrags to buy, and now a purchaser has turned \nup for the Moscow estate and for the house. If \nyou will be so kind, I'll fix a time and go down \nto the estate just for a day, and leave my lassies \nwith you." \n\n"All right. All right. They'll be safe with me, \nas safe as in Chancery 1 I'll take them where they \nmust go, scold them a bit, and pet them a bit," \nsaid Mdrya Dmftrievna, touching her god- \ndaughter and favorite, Natasha, on the cheek \nwith her large hand. \n\nNext morning Mdrya Dmftrievna took the \nyoung ladies to the Iberian shrine of the Moth- \ner of God and to Madame Suppert-Roguct, \nwho was so afraid of Mdrya Dmitrievna that \nshe always let her have costumes at a loss mere- \nly to get rid of her. Mdrya Dmitrievna ordered \nalmost the whole trousseau. When they got \nhome she turned every body out of the room ex- \ncept Natdsha, and then called her pet to her \narmchair. \n\n"Well, now we'll talk. I congratulate you on \nyour betrothed. You've hooked a fine fellow! I \nam glad for your sake and I've known him \nsince he was so high." She held her hand a cou- \nple of feet from the ground. Natdsha blushed \nhappily. "I like him and all his family. Now \nlisten! You know that old Prince Nicholas much \ndislikes his son's marrying. The old fellow's \ncrotchety! Of course Prince Andrew is not a \nchild and can shift without him, but it's not \nnice to enter a family against a father's will. \nOne wants to do it peacefully and lovingly. \nYou're a clever girl and you'll know how to \nmanage. Be kind, and use your wits. Then all \nwill be well." \n\nNatdsha remained silent, from shyness Mdrya \nDmftrievna supposed, but really because she \ndisliked anyone interfering in what touched \nher love of Prince Andrew, which seemed to \nher so apart from all human affairs that no one \ncould understand it. She loved and knew Prince \nAndrew, he loved her only, and was to come \none of these days and take her. She wanted \nnothing more. \n\n"You see I have known him a long time and \nam also fond of Mary, your future sister-in-law. \n'Husbands' sisters bring up blisters/ but this \n\n\n\none wouldn't hurt a fly. She has asked me to \nbring you two together. Tomorrow you'll go \nwith your father to see her. Be very nice and \naffectionate to her: you're younger than she. \nWhen he comes, he'll find you already know \nhis sister and father and are liked by them. Am \nI right or not? Won't that be best?" \n"Yes, it will," Natdsha answered reluctantly. \n\nCHAPTER VII \n\nNEXT DAY, by Mdrya Dmf trievna's advice, Count \nRost6v took Natdsha to call on Prince Nicholas \nBolk6nski. The count did not set out cheerful- \nly on this visit, at heart he felt afraid. He well \nremembered the last interview he had had with \nthe old prince at the time of the enrollment, \nwhen in reply to ah invitation to dinner he \nhad had to listen to an angry reprimand for \nnot having provided his full quota of men. Na- \ntdsha, on the other hand, having put on her \nbest gown, was in the highest spirits. "They \ncan't help liking me," she thought. "Everybody \nalways has liked me, and I am so willing to do \nanything they wish, so ready to be fond of him \nfor being his father andof her for being his \nsister that there is no reason for them not to \nlike me. . . ." \n\nThey drove up to the gloomy old house on \nthe Vozdvfzhenka and entered the vestibule. \n\n"Well, the Lord have mercy on us!" said the \ncount, half in jest, half in earnest; but Natdsha \nnoticed that her father was flurried on entering \nthe anteroom and inquired timidly and softly \nwhether the prince and princess were at home. \n\nWhen they had been announced a perturba- \ntion was noticeable among the servants. The \nfootman who had gone to announce them was \nstopped by another in the large hall and they \nwhispered to one another. Then a maidservant \nran into the hall and hurriedly said something, \nmentioning the princess. At last an old, cross- \nlooking footman came and announced to the \nRost6vs that the prince was not receiving, but \nthat the princess begged them to walk up. The \nfirst person who came to meet the visitors was \nMademoiselle Bourienne. She greeted the fa- \nther and daughter with special politeness and \nshowed them to the princess' room. The prin- \ncess, looking excited and nervous, her face \nflushed in patches, ran in to meet the visitors, \ntreading heavily, and vainly trying to appear \ncordial and at ease. From the first glance Prin- \ncess Mary did not like Natdsha. She thought \nher too fashionably dressed, frivolously gay and \nvain. She did not at all realize that before hav- \ning seen her future sister-in-law she was prej- \n\n\n\nBOOK EIGHT \n\n\n\nudiced against her by involuntary envy of her \nbeauty, youth, and happiness, as well as by \njealousy of her brother's love for her. Apart \nfrom this insuperable antipathy to her, Prin- \ncess Mary was agitated just then because on the \nRost6vs' being announced, the old prince had \nshouted that he did not wish to see them, that \nPrincess Mary might do so if she chose, but they \nwere not to be admitted to him. She had decid- \ned to receive them, but feared lest the prince \nmight at any moment indulge in some freak, \nas he seemed much upset by the Rost6vs' visit. \n\n"There, my dear princess, I've brought you \nmy songstress," said the count, bowing and \nlooking round uneasily as if afraid the old \nprince might appear. "I am so glad you should \nget to know one another . . . very sorry the prince \nis still ailing," and after a few more common- \nplace remarks he rose. "If you'll allow me to \nleave my Natdsha in your hands for a quarter \nof an hour, Princess, I'll drive round to see An- \nna Semenovnsft it's quite near in the Dogs' \nSquare, and then I'll come back for her." \n\nThe count had devised this diplomatic ruse \n(as he afterwards told his daughter) to give the \nfuture sisters-in-law an opportunity to talk to \none another freely, but another motive was to \navoid the danger of encountering the old prince, \nof whom he was afraid. He did not mention \nthis, to his daughter, but Natdsha noticed her \nfather's nervousness and anxiety and felt mor- \ntified by it. She blushed for him, grew still an- \ngrier at having blushed, and looked at the \nprincess with a bold and defiant expression \nwhich said that she was not afraid of anybody. \nThe princess told the count that she would be \ndelighted, and only begged him to stay longer \nat Anna Semenovna's, and he departed. \n\nDespite the uneasy glances thrown at her by \nPrincess Mary who wished to have a tete-a-tdte \nwith Natasha Mademoiselle Bourienne re- \nmained in the room and persistently talked \nabout Moscow amusements and theaters. Na- \ntasha felt offended by the hesitation she had \nnoticed in the anteroom, by her father's nerv- \nousness, and by the unnatural manner of the \nprincess who she thought was making a fa- \nvor of receiving her, and so everything dis- \npleased her. She did not like Princess Mary, \nwhom she thought very plain, affected, and dry. \nNatdsha suddenly shrank into herself and invol- \nuntarily assumed an offhand air which alien- \nated Princess Mary still more. After five minutes \nof irksome, constrained conversation, they \nheard the sound of slippered feet rapidly ap- \nproaching. Princess Mary looked frightened. \n\n\n\nThe door opened and the old prince, in a dress- \ning gown and a white nightcap, came in. \n\n"Ah, madam!" he began. "Madam, Count- \ness ... Countess Rostova, if I am not mistaken \n... I beg you to excuse me, to excuse me ... I \ndid not know, madam. God is my witness, I did \nnot know you had honored us with a visit, and \nI came in such a costume only to see my daugh- \nter. I beg you to excuse me ... God is my wit- \nness, I didn't know" he repeated, stressing \nthe word "God" so unnaturally and so unpleas- \nantly that Princess Mary stood with downcast \neyes not daring to look either at her father or \nat Natdsha. \n\nNor did the latter, having risen and curtsied, \nknow what to do. Mademoiselle Bourienne \nalone smiled agreeably. \n\n"I beg you to excuse me, excuse me! God is \nmy witness, I did not know," muttered the old \nman, and after looking Natdsha over from head \nto foot he went out. \n\nMademoiselle Bourienne was the first to re- \ncover herself after this apparition arid began \nspeaking about the prince's indisposition. Na- \ntdsha and Princess Mary looked at one anoth- \ner in silence, and the longer they did so with- \nout saying what they wanted to say, the greater \ngrew their antipathy to one another. \n\nWhen the count returned, Natdsha was im- \npolitely pleased and hastened to get away: at \nthat moment she hated the stiff, elderly prin- \ncess, who could place her in such an embarrass- \ning position and had spent half an hour with \nher without once mentioning Prince Andrew. \n"I couldn't begin talking about him in the \npresence of that Frenchwoman," thought Na- \ntdsha. The same thought was meanwhile tor- \nmenting Princess Mary. She knew what she \nought to have said to Natdsha, but she had \nbeen unable to say it because Mademoiselle \nBourienne was in the way, and because, with- \nout knowing why, she felt it very difficult to \nspeak of the marriage. When the count was al- \nready leaving the room, Princess Mary went up \nhurriedly to Natdsha, took her by the hand, and \nsaid with a deep sigh: \n\n"Wait, I must . . ." \n\nNatdsha glanced at her ironically without \nknowing why. \n\n"Dear Natalie," said Princess Mary, "I want \nyou to know that I am glad my brother has \nfound happiness. . . ." \n\nShe paused, feeling that she was not telling \nthe truth. Natdsha noticed this and guessed its \nreason. \n\n"I think, Princess, it is not convenient to \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nspeak of that now," she said with external dig- \nnity and coldness, though she felt the tears \nchoking her. \n\n"What have I said and what have I done?" \nthought she, as soon as she was out of the room. \n\nThey waited a long time for Natasha to come \nto dinner that day. She sat in her room crying \nlike a child, blowing her nose and sobbing. S6n- \nya stood beside her, kissing her hair. \n\n"Natasha, what is it about?" she asked. \n"What do they matter to you? It will all pass, \nNatdsha." \n\n"But if you only knew how offensive it was \n... as if I ..." \n\n"Don't talk about it, Natasha. It wasn't your \nfault so why should you mind? Kiss me," said \nS6nya. \n\nNatasha raised her head and, kissing her \nfriend on the lips, pressed her wet face against \nher. \n\n"I can't tell you, I don't know. No one's to \nblame," said Natasha "It's my fault. But it all \nhurts terribly. Oh, why doesn't he come? . . ." \n\nShe came in to dinner with red eyes. Mrya \nDmitrievna, who knew how the prince had re- \nceived the Rostovs, pretended not to notice \nhow upset Natasha was and jested resolutely \nand loudly at table with the count and the \nother guests. \n\nCHAPTER VIII \n\nTHAT EVENING the Rost6vs went to the Opera, \nfor which Mdrya Dmitrievna had taken a box. \n\nNatasha did not want to go, but could not re- \nfuse Marya Drni'trievna's kind offer which was \nintended expressly for her. When she came \nready dressed into the ballroom to await her \nfather, and looking in the large mirror there \nsaw that she was pretty, very pretty, she felt \neven more sad, but it was a sweet, tender sad- \nness. \n\n"O God, if he were here now I would not \nbehave as I did then, but differently. I would \nnot be silly and afraid of things, I would sim- \nply embrace him, cling to him, and make him \nlook at me with those searching inquiring eyes \nwith which he has so often looked at me, and \nthen I would make him laugh as he used to \nlaugh. And his eyes how I see those eyes!" \nthought Natasha. "And what do his father and \nsister matter to me? I love him alone, him, him, \nwith that face and those eyes, with his smile, \nmanly and yet childlike. . . . No, I had better \nnot think of him; not think of him but forget \nhim, quite forget him for the present. I can't \nbear this waiting and I shall cry in a minute!" \n\n\n\nand she turned away from the glass, making an \neffort not to cry. "And how can S6nya love \nNicholas so calmlyand quietlyand wait so long \nand so patiently?" thought she, looking at S6n- \nya, who also came in quite ready, with a fan in \nher hand. "No, she's altogether different. I \ncan't!" \n\nNatasha at that moment felt so softened and \ntender that it was not enough for her to love \nand know she was beloved, she wanted now, at \nonce, to embrace the man she loved, to speak \nand hear from him words of love such as filled \nher heart. While she sat in the carriage beside \nher father, pensively watching the lights of the \nstreet lamps flickering on the frozen window, \nshe felt still sadder and more in love, and for- \ngot where she was going and with whom. Hav- \ning fallen into the line of carriages, the Ros- \ntovs' carriage drove up to the theater, its wheels \nsqueaking over the snow. Natasha and S6nya, \nholding up their dresses, jumped out quickly. \nThe count got out helped by thefltaotmen, and, \npassing among men and women who were en- \ntering and the program sellers, they all three \nwent along the corridor to the first row of box- \nes. Through the closed doors the music was al- \nready audible. \n\n"Natasha, your hair! . . ." whispered S6nya. \n\nAn attendant deferentially and quickly \nslipped before the ladies and opened the door \nof their box. The music sounded louder and \nthrough the door rows of brightly lit boxes in \nwhich ladies sat with bare arms and shoulders, \nand noisy stalls brilliant with uniforms, glit- \ntered before their eyes. A lady entering the next \nbox shot a glance of feminine envy at Natasha. \nThe curtain had not yet risen and the overture \nwas being played. Natasha, smoothing her \ngown, went in with S6nya and sat down, scan- \nning the brilliant tiers of boxes opposite. A sen- \nsation she had not experienced for a long time \nthat of hundreds of eyes looking at her bare \narms and neck suddenly affected her both \nagreeably and disagreeably and called up a \nwhole crowd of memories, desires and emo- \ntions associated with that feeling. \n\nThe two remarkably pretty girls, Natasha and \nS6nya, with Count Rost6v who had not been \nseen in Moscow for a long time, attracted gen- \neral attention. Moreover, everybody knew \nvaguely of Natasha's engagement to Prince An- \ndrew, and knew that the Rostovs had lived in \nthe country ever since, and all looked with cu- \nriosity at a fiancee who was making one of the \nbest matches in Russia. \n\nNatdsha's looks, as everyone told her, had \n\n\n\nBOOK EIGHT \n\n\n\nimproved in the country, and that evening \nthanks to her agitation she was particularly \npretty. She struck those who saw her by her full- \nness of life and beauty, combined with her in- \ndifference to everything about her. Her black \neyes looked at the crowd without seeking any- \none, and her delicate arm, bare to above the el- \nbow, lay on the velvet edge of the box, while, \nevidently unconsciously, she opened and closed \nher hand in time to the music, crumpling her \nprogram. "Look, there's Al^nina," said S6nya, \n"with her mother, isn't it?" \n\n"Dear me, Michael Kirttovich has grown still \nstouter!" remarked the count. \n\n"Look at our Anna Mikhdylovna what a \nheaddress she has on!" \n\n"The Karagins, Julieand Boris with them. \nOne can see at once that they're engaged " \n\n"Drubetskoy has proposed?" \n\n"Oh yes, I heard it today," said Shinshin, \ncoming into the Rostovs' box. \n\nNatasha looked in the direction in which her \nfather's eyes were turned and saw Julie sitting \nbeside her mother with a happy look on her \nface and a string of pearls round her thick red \nneckwhich Natiisha knew was covered with \npowder. Behind them, wearing a smile and \nleaning over with an ear to Julie's mouth, was \nBoris* handsome smoothly brushed head. He \nlooked at the Rostrtvs from under his brows and \nsaid something, smiling, to his betrothed. \n\n"They are talking about us, about me and \nhim!" thought Natasha. "And he no doubt is \ncalming her jealousy of me. They needn't trou- \nble themselves! If only they knew how little I \nam concerned about any of them." \n\nBehind them sat Anna Mikhaylovna wearing \na green headdress and with a happy look of res- \nignation to the will of God on her face. Their \nbox was pervaded by that atmosphere of an af- \nfianced couple which Natasha knew so well \nand liked so much. She turned away and sud- \ndenly remembered all that had been so humil- \niating in her morning's visit. \n\n"What right has he not to wish to receive \nme into his family? Oh, better not think of it \nnot till he comes back!" she told herself, and \nbegan looking at the faces, some strange and \nsome familiar, in the stalls. In the front, in the \nvery center, leaning back against the orchestra \nrail, stood D61okhov in a Persian dress, his \ncurly hair brushed up into a huge shock. He \nstood in full view of the audience, well aware \nthat he was attracting everyone's attention, yet \nas much at ease as though he were in his own \nroom. Around him thronged Moscow's most \n\n\n\nbrilliant young men, whom he evidently dom- \ninated. \n\nThe count, laughing, nudged the blushing \nSonya and pointed to her former adorer. \n\n"Do you recognize him?" said he. "And where \nhas he sprung from?" he asked, turning to \nShinshin. "Didn't he vanish somewhere?" \n\n"He did," replied Shinshin. "He was in the \nCaucasus and ran away from there. They say \nhe has been acting as minister to some ruling \nprince in Persia, where he killed the Shah's \nbrother. Now all the Moscow ladies are mad \nabout him! It's 'D61okhov the Persian' that does \nit! We never hear a word but D61okhov is men- \ntioned. They swear by him, they offer him to \nyou as they would a dish of choice sterlet. D61o- \nkhov and Anatole Kurigin have turned all our \nladies' heads." \n\nA tall, beautiful woman with a mass of plait- \ned hair and much exposed plump white shoul- \nders arid neck, round which she wore a double \nstring of large pearls, entered the adjoining \nbox rustling her heavy silk dress and took a long \ntime settling into her place. \n\nNatdsha involuntarily gazed at that neck, \nthose shoulders, and pearls and coiffure, and \nadmired the beauty of the shoulders and the \npearls. While Natdsha was fixing her gaze on \nher for the second time the lady looked round \nand, meeting the count's eyes, nodded to him \nand smiled. She was the Countess Beziikhova, \nPierre's wife, and the count, who knew every- \none in society, leaned over and spoke to her. \n\n"Have you been here long, Countess?" he in- \nquired. "I'll call, I'll call to kiss your hand. I'm \nhere on business and have brought my girls \nwith me. They say Semenova acts marvelously. \nCount Pierre never used to forget us. Is he \nhere?" \n\n"Yes, he meant to look in," answered Hlne, \nand glanced attentively at Natdsha. \n\nCount Rost6v resumed his seat. \n\n"Handsome, isn't she?" he whispered to Na- \ntdsha. \n\n"Wonderful!" answered Natdsha. "She's a \nwoman one could easily fall in love with." \n\nJust then the last chords of the overture were \nheard and the conductor tapped with his stick. \nSome latecomers took their seats in the stalls, \nand the curtain rose. \n\nAs soon as it rose everyone in the boxes and \nstalls became silent, and all the men, old and \nyoung, in uniform and evening dress, and all \nthe women with gems on their bare flesh, turned \ntheir whole attention with eager curiosity to \nthe stage. Natasha too began to look at it. \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX \n\nTHE FLOOR OF THE STAGE consisted of smooth \nboards, at the sides was some painted card- \nboard representing trees, and at the back was \na cloth stretched over boards. In the center of \nthe stage sat some girls in red bodices and white \nskirts. One very fat girl in a white silk dress sat \napart on a low bench, to the back of which a \npiece of green cardboard was glued. They all \nsang something. When they had finished their \nsong the girl in white went up to the prompt- \ner's box and a man with tight silk trousers over \nhis stout legs, and holding a plume and a dag- \nger, went up to her and began singing, waving \nhis arms about. \n\nFirst the man in the tight trousers sang alone, \nthen she sang, then they both paused while the \norchestra played and the man fingered the hand \nof the girl in white, obviously awaiting the beat \nto start singing with her. They sang together \nand everyone in the theater began clapping \nand shouting, while the man and woman on \nthe stage who represented lovers began smil- \ning, spreading out their arms, and bowing. \n\nAfter her life in the country, and in her pres- \nent serious mood, all this seemed grotesque and \namazing to Natdsha. She could not follow the \nopera nor even listen to the music; she saw on- \nly the painted cardboard and the queerly \ndressed men and women who moved, spoke, \nand sang so strangely in that brilliant light. \nShe knew what it was all meant to represent, \nbut it was so pretentiously false and unnatural \nthat she first felt ashamed for the actors and \nthen amused at them. She looked at the faces of \nthe audience, seeking in them the same senseof \nridicule and perplexity she herself experienced, \nbut they all seemed attentive to what was hap- \npening on the stage, and expressed delight \nwhich to Natdsha seemed feigned. "I suppose \nit has to be like this!" she thought. She kept \nlooking round in turn at the rows of pomaded \nheads in the stalls and then at the seminude \nwomen in the boxes, especially at H^lene in \nthe next box, who apparently quite unclothed \nsat with a quiet tranquil smile, not taking her \neyes off the stage. And feeling the bright light \nthat flooded the whole place and the warm air \nheated by the crowd, Natdsha little by little be- \ngan to pass into a state of intoxication she had \nnot experienced for a long while. She did not \nrealize who and where she was, nor what was \ngoing on before her. As she looked and thought, \nthe strangest fancies unexpectedly and discon- \nnectedly passed through her mind: the idea oc- \ncurred to her of jumping onto the edge of the \n\n\n\nbox and singing the air the actress was singing, \nthen she wished to touch with her fan an old \ngentleman sitting not far from her, then to \nlean over to Hlene and tickle her. \n\nAt a moment when all was quiet before the \ncommencement of a song, a door leading to the \nstalls on the side nearest the Rost6vs' box \ncreaked, and the steps of a belated arrival were \nheard. "There's Kurdgin!" whispered Shinshfn. \nCountess Bezukhova turned smiling to the new- \ncomer, and Natdsha, following the direction of \nthat look, saw an exceptionally handsome ad- \njutant approaching their box with aself-assured \nyet courteous bearing. This was Anatole Kurd- \ngin whom she had seen and noticed long ago at \nthe ball in Petersburg. He was now in an adju- \ntant's uniform with one epaulet and a shoulder \nknot. He moved with a restrained swagger \nwhich would have been ridiculous had he not \nbeen so good-looking and had his handsome \nface not worn such an expression of good- \nhumored complacency and gaiety. Though the \nperformance was proceeding, he walked delib- \nerately down the carpeted gangway, his sword \nand spurs slightly jingling and his handsome \nperfumed head held high. Having looked at \nNatdsha he approached his sister, laid his well- \ngloved hand on the edge of her box, nodded to \nher, and leaning forward asked a question, with \na motion toward Natdsha. \n\n"Mais charmante!" said he, evidently refer- \nring to Natdsha, who did not exactly hear his \nwords but understood them from the move- \nment of his lips. Then he took his place in the \nfirst row of the stalls and sat down beside D6- \nlokhov, nudging with his elbow in a friendly \nand offhand way that D61okhov whom others \ntreated so fawningly. He winked at him gaily, \nsmiled, and rested his foot against the orchestra \nscreen. \n\n"How like the brother is to the sister," re- \nmarked the count. "And how handsome they \nboth are!" \n\nShinshi'n, lowering his voice, began to tell \nthe count of some intrigue of Kurdgin'sin Mos- \ncow, and Natdsha tried to overhear it just be- \ncause he had said she was "charmante." \n\nThe first act was over. In the stalls everyone \nbegan moving about, going out and coming in. \n\nBoris came to the Rost6vs' box, received \ntheir congratulations very simply, and raising \nhis eyebrows with an absent-minded smile con- \nveyed to Natdsha and Sonya his fiancee's invi- \ntation to her wedding, and went away. Natdsha \nwith a gay, coquettish smile talked to him, and \ncongratulated on his approaching wedding that \n\n\n\nBOOK EIGHT \n\n\n\nsame Boris with whom she had formerly been \nin love. In the state of intoxication she was \nin, everything seemed simple and natural. \n\nThe scantily clad Hlne smiled at everyone \nin the same way, and Natasha gave Boris a sim- \nilar smile. \n\nHdne's box was filled and surrounded from \nthe stalls by the most distinguished and intel- \nlectual men, who seemed to vie with one anoth- \ner in their wish to let everyone see that they \nknew her. \n\nDuring the whole of that entr'acte Kurdgin \nstood with D61okhov in front of the orchestra \npartition, looking at the Rostovs' box. Natasha \nknew he was talking about her and this afford- \ned her pleasure. She even turned so that he \nshould see her profile in what she thought was \nits most becoming aspect. Before the beginning \nof the second act Pierre appeared in the stalls. \nThe Rostovs had not seen him since their ar- \nrival. His face looked sad, and he had grown \nstill stouter since Natasha last saw him. He \npassed up to the front rows, not noticing any- \none. Anatole went up to him and began speak- \ning to him, looking at and indicating the Ros- \ntovs' box. On seeing Natasha Pierre grew ani- \nmated and, hastily passing between the rows, \ncame toward their box. When he got there he \nleaned on his elbows and, smiling, talked to her \nfor a long time. While conversing with Pierre, \nNatasha heard a man's voice in Countess Beziik- \nhova's box and something told her it was Kurd- \ngin. She turned and their eyes met. Almost \nsmiling, he gazed straight into her eyes with \nsuch an enraptured caressing look that it seemed \nstrange to be so near him, to look at him like \nthat, to be so sure he admired her, and not to \nbe acquainted with him. \n\nIn the second act there was scenery repre- \nsenting tombstones, and there was a round hole \nin the canvas to represent the moon, shades \nwere raised over the footlights, and from horns \nand contrabass came deep notes while many \npeople appeared from right and left wearing \nblack cloaks and holding things like daggers in \ntheir hands. They began waving their arms. \nThen some other people ran in and began drag- \nging away the maiden who had been in white \nand was now in light blue. They did not drag \nher away at once, but sang with her for a long \ntime and then at last dragged her off, and be- \nhind the scenes something metallic was struck \nthree times and everyone knelt down and sang \na prayer. All these things were repeatedly inter- \nrupted by the enthusiastic shouts of the audi- \nence. \n\n\n\n319 \n\n\n\nDuring this act every time Natasha looked \ntoward the stalls she saw Anatole Kurdgin with \nan arm thrown across the back of his chair, star- \ning at her. She was pleased to see that he was \ncaptivated by her and it did not occur to her \nthat there was anything wrong in it. \n\nWhen the second act was over Countess Be- \nziikhova rose, turned to the Rost6vs' box her \nwhole bosom completely exposed beckoned \nthe old count with a gloved finger, and paying \nno attention to those who had entered her box \nbegan talking to him with an amiable smile. \n\n"Do make me acquainted with your charm- \ning daughters," said she. "The whole town is \nsinging their praises and I don't even know \nthem." \n\nNattlsha rose and curtsied to the splendid \ncountess. She was so pleased by praise from \nthis brilliant beauty that she blushed with \npleasure. \n\n"I want to become a Moscovite too, now," \nsaid Hlne. "How is it you're not ashamed to \nbury such pearls in the country?" \n\nCountess Beziikhova quite deserved her rep- \nutation of being a fascinating woman. She \ncould say what she did not think especially \nwhat was flattering quite simply and natural- \n\niy- \n\n"Dear count, you must let me look afteryour \ndaughters! Though I am not staying here long \nthis time nor are you I will try to amuse them. \nI have already heard much of you in Peters- \nburg and wanted to get to know you," said she \nto Natasha with her stereotyped and lovely \nsmile. "I had heard about you from my page, \nDrubetskoy. Have you heard he is getting mar- \nried? And also from my husband's friend Bol- \nk6nski, Prince Andrew Bolk6nski," she went \non with special emphasis, implying that she \nknew of his relation to Natasha. To get better \nacquainted she asked that one of the young \nladies should come into her box for the rest of \nthe performance, and Natdsha moved over to \nit. \n\nThe scene of the third act represented a pal- \nace in which many candles were burning and \npictures of knights with short beards hung on \nthe walls. In the middle stood what were prob- \nably a king and a queen. The king waved his \nright arm and, evidently nervous, sang some- \nthing badly and sat down on a crimson throne. \nThe maiden who had been first in white and \nthen in light blue, now wore only a smock, and \nstood beside the throne with her hair down. \nShe sangsomething mournfully, addressing the \nqueen, but the king waved his arm severely, \n\n\n\n320 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nand men and women with bare legs came in \nfrom both sides and began dancing all together. \nThen the violins played very shrilly and mer- \nrily and one of the women with thick bare legs \nand thin arms, separating from the others, went \nbehind the wings, adjusted her bodice, returned \nto the middle of the stage, and began jump- \ning and striking one foot rapidly against the \nother. In the stalls everyone clapped and shout- \ned "bravo!" Then one of the men went into a \ncorner of the stage. The cymbals and horns in \nthe orchestra struck up more loudly, and this \nman with bare legs jumped very high and waved \nhis feet about very rapidly. (He was Duport, \nwho received sixty thousand rubles a year for \nthis art.) Everybody in the stalls, boxes, and \ngalleries began clapping and shouting with all \ntheir might, and the man stopped and began \nsmiling and bowing to all sides. Then other \nmen and women danced with bare legs. Then \nthe king again shouted to the sound of music, \nand they all began singing. But suddenly a \nstorm came on, chromatic scales and diminished \nsevenths were heard in the orchestra, everyone \nran off, again dragging one of their number \naway, and the curtain dropped. Once more \nthere was a terrible noise and clatter among the \naudience, and with rapturous faces everyone \nbegan shouting: "Duport I Duport! Duport!" \nNatdsha no longer thought this strange. She \nlook about with pleasure, smiling joyfully. \n\n"Isn't Duport delightful?" Hlneasked her. \n\n"Oh, yes," replied Natdsha. \n\nCHAPTER X \n\nDURING THE entr'acte a whiff of cold air came \ninto Hlne's box, the door opened, and Ana- \ntole entered, stooping and trying not to brush \nagainst anyone. \n\n"Let me introduce my brother to you," said \nHlne, her eyes shifting uneasily from Na- \ntdsha to Anatole. \n\nNatdsha turned her pretty little head toward \nthe elegant young officer and smiled at him \nover her bare shoulder. Anatole, who was as \nhandsome at close quarters as at a distance, sat \ndown beside her and told her he had long \nwished to have this happinessever since the \nNaryshkins' ball in fact, at which he had had \nthe well-remembered pleasure of seeing her. \nKurdgin was much more sensible and simple \nwith women than among men. He talked bold- \nly and naturally, and Natasha was strangely \nand agreeably struck by the fact that there was \nnothing formidable in this man about whom \nthere was so much talk, but that on the con- \n\n\n\ntrary his smile was most nai've, cheerful, and \ngood-natured. \n\nKurdgin asked her opinion of the perform- \nance and told her how at a previous perform- \nance Semenova had fallen down on the stage. \n\n"And do you know, Countess," he said, sud- \ndenly addressing her as an old, familiar ac- \nquaintance, "we are getting up a costume tour- \nnament; you ought to take part in it! It will \nbe great fun. We shall all meet at the Kardgins'l \nPlease come! No! Really, eh?" said he. \n\nWhile saying this he never removed his smil- \ning eyes from her face, her neck, and her bare \narms. Natdsha knew for certain that he was en- \nraptured by her. This pleased her, yet his pres- \nence made her feel constrained and oppressed. \nWhen she was not looking at him she felt \nthat he was looking at her shoulders, and she \ninvoluntarily caught his eye so that he should \nlook into hers rather than this. But looking in- \nto his eyes she was frightened, realizing that \nthere was not that barrier of modesty she had \nalways felt between herself and other men. She \ndid not know how it was that within five min- \nutes she had come to feel herself terribly near \nto this man. When she turned away she feared \nhe might seize her from behind by her bare arm \nand kiss her on the neck. They spoke of most \nordinary things, yet she felt that they were clos- \ner to one another than she had ever been to \nany man. Natdsha kept turning to Hdene and \nto her father, as if asking what it all meant, but \nHe*lene was engaged in conversation with a \ngeneral and did not answer her look, and her \nfather's eyes said nothing but what they always \nsaid: "Having a good time? Well, I'm glad of \nit!" \n\nDuring one of these moments of awkward \nsilence when Anatole's prominent eyes were \ngazing calmly and fixedly at her, Natdsha, to \nbreak the silence, asked him how he liked Mos- \ncow. She asked the question and blushed. She \nfelt all the time that by talking to him she was \ndoing something improper. Anatole smiled as \nthough to encourage her. \n\n"At first I did not like it much, because what \nmakesa townpleasantcejorcf lesjoliesjemmes? \nisn't that so? But now I like it very much in- \ndeed," he said, looking at her significantly. \n"You'll come to the costume tournament, \nCountess? Do come!" and putting out his hand \nto her bouquet and dropping his voice, he add- \ned, "You will be the prettiest there. Do come, \ndear countess, and give me this flower as a \npledge!" \n\n1 Are the pretty women. \n\n\n\nBOOK EIGHT \n\n\n\n321 \n\n\n\nNatdsha did not understand what he was \nsaying any more than he did himself, but she \nfelt that his incomprehensible words had an \nimproper intention. She did not know what to \nsay and turned away as if she had not heard his \nremark. But as soon as she had turned away she \nfelt that he was there, behind, so close behind \nher. \n\n"How is he now? Confused? Angry? Ought \nI to put it right?" she asked herself, and she \ncould not refrain from turning round. She \nlooked straight into his eyes, and his nearness, \nself-assurance, and the good-natured tenderness \nof his smile vanquished her. She smiled just as \nhe was doing, gazing straight into his eyes. \nAnd again she felt with horror that no barrier \nlay between him and her. \n\nThe curtain rose again. Anatole left the box, \nserene and gay. Natasha went back to her fa- \nther in the other box, now quite submissive to \nthe world she found herself in. All that was \ngoing on before her now seemed quite nat- \nural, but on the other hand all her previous \nthoughts of her betrothed, of Princess Mary, \nor of life in the country did not once recur \nto her mind and were as if belonging to a re- \nmote past. \n\nIn the fourth act there was some sort of dev- \nil who sang waving his arm about, till the \nboards were withdrawn from under him and he \ndisappeared down below. That was the only \npart of the fourth act that Natasha saw. She \nfelt agitated and tormented, and the cause of \nthis was Kurdgin whom she could not help \nwatching. As they were leaving the theater An- \natole came up to them, called their carriage, \nand helped them in. As he was putting Na- \ntdsha in he pressed her arm above the elbow. \nAgitated and flushed she turned round. He was \nlooking at her with glittering eyes, smiling ten- \nderly. \n\nOnly after she had reached home was Na- \ntasha able clearly to think over what had hap- \npened to her, and suddenly remembering \nPrince Andrew she was horrified, and at tea to \nwhich all had sat down after the opera, she \ngave a loud exclamation, flushed, and ran out \nof the room. \n\n"O God! I am lost!" she said to herself. "How \ncould I let him?" She sat for a long time hiding \nher flushed face in her hands trying to realize \nwhat had happened to her, but was unable ei- \nther to understand what had happened or what \nshe felt. Everything seemed dark, obscure, and \nterrible. There in that enormous, illuminated \n\n\n\ntheater where the bare-legged Duport, in a tin- \nsel-decorated jacket, jumped about to the music \non wet boards, and young girls and old men, and \nthe nearly naked Hdene with her proud, calm \nsmile, rapturously cried "bravo!" there in the \npresence of that Hellene it had all seemed -clear \nand simple; but now, alone by herself, it was \nincomprehensible. "What is it? What was that \nterror I felt of him? What is this gnawing of \nconscience I am feeling now?" she thought. \n\nOnly to the old countess at night in bed \ncould Natasha have told all she was feeling. \nShe knew that S6nya with her severe and sim- \nple views would cither not understand it at all \nor would be horrified at such a confession. So \nNatdsha tried to solve what was torturing her \nby herself. \n\n"Am I spoiled for Andrew's love or not?"she \nasked herself, and with soothing irony replied: \n"What a fool I am to ask that! What did hap- \npen to me? Nothing! I have clone nothing, I \ndidn't lead him on at all. Nobody will know \nand I shall never see him again," she told her- \nself. "So it is plain that nothing has happened \nand there is nothing to repent of, and Andrew \ncan love me still. But why 'still?' O God, why \nisn't he here?" Natdsha quieted herself for a \nmoment, but again some instinct told her that \nthough all this was true, and though nothing \nhad happened, yet the former purity of her \nlove for Prince Andrew had perished. And \nagain in imagination she went over her whole \nconversation with Kuragin, and again saw the \nface, gestures, arid tender smile of that bold \nhandsome man when he pressed her arm. \n\nCHAPTER XI \n\nANATOLE KURAGIN was staying in Moscow be- \ncause his father had sent him away from Pe- \ntersburg, where he had been spending twenty \nthousand rubles a year in cash, besides running \nup debts for as much more, which his creditors \ndemanded from his father. \n\nHis father announced to him that he would \nnow pay half his debts for the last time, but on- \nly on condition that he went to Moscow as ad- \njutant to the commander in chief a post his \nfather had procured for him and would at \nlast try to make a good match there. He indi- \ncated tohim Princess Mary and Julie Kardgina. \n\nAnatole consented and went to Moscow, \nwhere he put up at Pierre's house. Pierre re- \nceived him unwillingly at first, but got used to \nhim after a while, sometimes even accompanied \nhim on his carousals, and gave him money un- \nder the guise of loans. \n\n\n\n3** \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nAs Shinshin had remarked, from the time of \nhis arrival Anatole had turned the heads of the \nMoscow ladies, especially by the fact that he \nslighted them and plainly preferred the gyp- \nsy girls and French actresses with the chief of \nwhon^, Mademoiselle George, he was said to be \non intimate relations. He had never missed a \ncarousal at Danflov's or other Moscow revel- \ners', drank whole nights through, outvying ev- \neryone else, and was at all the balls and parties \nof the best society. There was talk of his in- \ntrigues with some of the ladies, and he flirted \nwith a few of them at the balls. But he did not \nrun after the unmarried girls, especially the \nrich heiresses who were most of them plain. \nThere was a special reason for this, as he had \ngot married two years beforea fact known on- \nly to his most intimate friends. At that time \nwhile with his regiment in Poland, a Polish \nlandowner of small means had forced him to \nmarry his daughter. Anatole had very soon \nabandoned his wife and, for a payment which \nhe agreed to send to his father-in-law, had ar- \nranged to be free to pass himself off as a bach- \nelor. \n\nAnatole was always con tent with his position, \nwith himself, and with others. He was instinc- \ntively and thoroughly convinced that it was \nimpossible for him to live otherwise than as he \ndid and that he had never in his life done any- \nthing base. He was incapable of considering \nhow his actions might affect others or what the \nconsequences of this or that action of his might \nbe. He was convinced that, as a duck is so made \nthat it must live in water, so God had made \nhim such that he must spend thirty thousand \nrubles a year and always occupy a prominent \nposition in society. He believed this so firmly \nthat others, looking at him, were persuaded of \nit too and did not refuse him either a leading \nplace in society or money, which he borrowed \nfrom anyone and everyone and evidently \nwould not repay. \n\nHe was not a gambler, at any rate he did not \ncare about winning. He was not vain. He did \nnot mind what people thought of him. Still less \ncould he be accused of ambition. More than \nonce he had vexed his father by spoiling his \nown career, and he laughed at distinctions of \nall kinds. He was not mean, and did not refuse \nanyone who asked of him. All he cared about \nwas gaiety and women, and as according to his \nideas there was nothing dishonorable in these \ntastes, and he was incapable of considering what \nthe gratification of his tastes entailed for oth- \ners, he honestly considered himself irreproach- \n\n\n\nable, sincerely despised rogues and bad peo- \nple, and with a tranquil conscience carried his \nhead high. \n\nRakes, those male Magdalenes, have a se- \ncret feeling of innocence similar to that which \nfemale Magdalenes have, based on the same \nhope of forgiveness. "All will be forgiven her, \nfor she loved much; and all will be forgiven \nhim, for he enjoyed much." \n\nD61okhov, who had reappeared that year in \nMoscow after his exile and his Persian adven- \ntures, and was leading a life of luxury, gam- \nbling, and dissipation, associated with his old \nPetersburg comrade Kurdgin and made use of \nhim for his own ends. \n\nAnatole was sincerely fond of D61okhov for \nhis cleverness and audacity. D61okhov, who \nneeded Anatole Kurdgin's name, position, and \nconnections as a bait to draw rich young men \ninto his gambling set, made use of him and \namused himself at his expense without letting \nthe other feel it. Apart from the advantage he \nderived from Anatole, the very process of \ndominating another's will was in itself a pleas- \nure, a habit, and a necessity to D61okhov. \n\nNatdsha had made a strong impression on \nKurdgin. At supper after the opera he described \nto D61okhov with the air of a connoisseur the \nattractions of her arms, shoulders, feet, and \nhair and expressed his intention of making \nlove to her. Anatole had no notion and was in- \ncapable of considering what might come of \nsuch love-making, as he never had any notion \nof the outcome of any of his actions. \n\n"She's first-rate, my dear fellow, but not for \nus," replied Dolokhov. \n\n"I will tell my sister to ask her to dinner," \nsaid Anatole. "Eh?" \n\n"You'd better wait till she's married. . . ." \n\n"You know, I adore little girls, they lose \ntheir heads at once," pursued Anatole. \n\n"You have been caught once already by a \n'little girl'," said D61okhov who knew of Ku- \nrdgin's marriage. "Take care!" \n\n"Well, that can't happen twice! Eh?" said \nAnatole, with a good-humored laugh. \n\nCHAPTER XII \n\nTHE DAY AFTER THE OPERA the Rost6vs went \nnowhere and nobody came to see them. Mrya \nDmitrievna talked to the count about some- \nthing which they concealed from Natasha. Na- \ntdsha guessed they were talking about the old \nprince and planning something, and this dis- \nquieted and offended her. She was expecting \nPrince Andrew any moment and twice that \n\n\n\nBOOK EIGHT \n\n\n\n323 \n\n\n\nday sent a manservant to the Vozdvizhenka to \nascertain whether he had come. He had not ar- \nrived. She suffered more now than during her \nfirst days in Moscow. To her impatience and \npining for him were now added the unpleas- \nant recollection of her interview with Princess \nMary and the old prince, and a fear and anxi- \nety of which she did not understand the cause. \nShe continually fancied that either he would \nnever come or that something would happen \nto her before he came. She could no longer \nthink of him by herself calmly and continuous- \nly as she had done before. As soon as she be- \ngan to think of him, the recollection of the old \nprince, of Princess Mary, of the theater, and \nof Kurdgin mingled with her thoughts. The \nquestion again presented itself whether she \nwas not guilty, whether she had not already \nbroken faith with Prince Andrew, and again \nshe found herself recalling to the minutest de- \ntail every word, every gesture, and every shade \nin the play of expression on the face of the \nman who had been able to arouse in her such \nan incomprehensible and terrifying feeling. \nTo the family Natasha seemed livelier than \nusual, but she was far less tranquil and happy \nthan before. \n\nOn Sunday morning Mdrya Dmitrievna in- \nvited her visitors to Mass at her parish church \n-the Church of the Assumption built over the \ngraves of victims of the plague. \n\n"I don't like those fashionable churches," \nshe said, evidently priding herself on her in- \ndependence of thought. "God is the same every- \nwhere. We have an excellent priest, he con- \nducts the service decently and with dignity, and \nthe deacon is the same. What holiness is there \nin giving concerts in the choir? I don't like it, \nit's just self-indulgence!" \n\nMdrya Dmftrievna liked Sundays and knew \nhow to keep them. Her whole house was \nscrubbed and cleaned on Saturdays; neither \nshe nor the servants worked, and they all wore \nholiday dress and went to church. At her table \nthere were extra dishes at dinner, and the serv- \nants had vodka and roast goose or suckling pig. \nBut in nothing in the house was the holiday \nso noticeable as in Mdrya Dmitrievna's broad, \nstern face, which on that day wore an invari- \nable look of solemn festivity. \n\nAfter Mass, when they had finished their \ncoffee in the dining room where the loose cov- \ners had been removed from the furniture, a \nservant announced that the carriage was ready, \nand Mdrya Dmftrievna rose with a stern air. \nShe wore her holiday shawl, in which she paid \n\n\n\nCalls, and announced that she was going to see \nPrince Nicholas Bolk6nski to have an explana- \ntion with him about Natdsha. \n\nAfter she had gone, a dressmaker from Ma- \ndame Suppert-Roguet waited on the Rost6vs, \nand Natdsha, very glad of this diversion, hav- \ning shut herself into a room adjoining the \ndrawing room, occupied herself trying on the \nnew dresses. Just as she had put on a bodice \nwithout sleeves and only tacked together, and \nwas turning her head to see in the glass how \nthe back fitted, she heard in the drawing room \nthe animated sounds of her father's voice and \nanother's a woman's that made her flush. It \nwas Hlne. Natdsha had not time to take off \nthe bodice before the door opened and Count- \ness Beziikhova, dressed in a purple velvet gown \nwith a high collar, came into the room beam- \ning with good-humored amiable smiles. \n\n"Oh, my enchantress I "she cried to the blush- \ning Natdsha. "Charming! No, this is really be- \nyond anything, my dear count," said she to \nCount Rostov who had followed her in. "How \ncan you live in Moscow and go nowhere? No, \nI won't let you off! Mademoiselle George will \nrecite at my house tonight and there'll be some \npeople, and if you don't bring your lovely girls \nwho are prettier than Mademoiselle George \nI won't know you! My husband is away in \nTver or I would send him to fetch you. You \nmust come. You positively must! Between eight \nand nine." \n\nShe nodded to the dressmaker, whom she \nknew and who had curtsied respectfully to her, \nand seated herself in an armchair beside the \nlooking glass, draping the folds of her velvet \ndress picturesquely. She did not cease chatter- \ning good-naturedly and gaily, continually prais- \ning Natdsha's beauty. She looked at Natasha's \ndresses and praised them, as well as a new dress \nof her own made of "metallic gauze," which \nshe had received from Paris, and advised Na- \ntdsha to have one like it. \n\n"But anything suits you, my charmer!" she \nremarked. \n\nA smile of pleasure never left Natdsha's face. \nShe felt happy and as if she were blossoming \nunder the praise of this dear Countess Beziik- \nhova who had formerly seemed to her so unap- \nproachable and important and was now so \nkind to her. Natdsha brightened up and felt al- \nmost in love with this woman, who was so \nbeautiful and so kind. Hdene for her part was \nsincerely delighted with Natdsha and wished \nto give her a good time. Anatole had asked her \nto bring him and Natdsha together, and she \n\n\n\n3*4 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nwas calling on the Rost6vs for that purpose. \nThe idea of throwing her brother and Natasha \ntogether amused her. \n\nThough at one time, in Petersburg, she had \nbeen annoyed with Natdsha for drawing Boris \naway, she did not think of that now, and in her \nown way heartily wished Natdsha well. As she \nwas leaving the Rost6vs she called her protegee \naside. \n\n"My brother dined with me yesterdaywe \nnearly died of laughter he ate nothing and \nkept sighing for you, my charmer! He is madly, \nquite madly, in love with you, my dear." \n\nNatdsha blushed scarlet when she heard this. \n\n"How she blushes, how she blushes, my pret- \nty!" said He*lene. "You must certainly come. If \nyou love somebody, my charmer, that is not a \nreason to shut yourself up. Even if you are en- \ngaged, I am sure your fiance* would wish you to \ngo into society rather than be bored to death." \n\n"So she knows I am engaged, and she and \nher husband Pierrethat good Pierre have \ntalked and laughed about this. So it's all right." \nAnd again, under He*lene's influence, what \nhad seemed terrible now seemed simple and \nnatural. "And she is such a grande dame, so \nkind, and evidently likes me so much. And why \nnot enjoy myself?" thought Natdsha, gazing at \nHellene with wide-open, wondering eyes. \n\nMdrya Dmitrievna came back to dinner taci- \nturn and serious, having evidently suffered a \ndefeat at the old prince's. She was still too agi- \ntated by the encounter to be able to talk of the \naffair calmly. In answer to the count's inquiries \nshe replied that things were all right and that \nshe would tell about it next day. On hearing of \nCountess Bezukhova's visit and the invitation \nfor that evening, Mdrya Dmftrievna remarked: \n\n"I don't care to have anything to do with \nBezukhova and don't advise you to; however, \nif you've promised go. It will divert your \nthoughts," she added, addressing Natdsha. \n\nCHAPTER XIII \n\nCOUNT ROSTOV took the girls to Countess Be- \nzukhova's. There were a good many people \nthere, but nearly all strangers to Natdsha. \nCount Rost6v was displeased to see that the \ncompany consisted almost entirely of men and \nwomen known for the freedom of their con- \nduct. Mademoiselle George was standing in a \ncorner of the drawing room surrounded by \nyoung men. There were several Frenchmen \npresent, among them Mdtivier who from the \ntime He*lene reached Moscow had been an inti- \nmate in her house. The count decided not to \n\n\n\nsit down to cards or let his girls out of his sight \nand to get away as soon as Mademoiselle \nGeorge's performance was over. \n\nAnatole was at the door, evidently on the \nlookout for the Rost6vs. Immediately after \ngreeting the count he went up to Natdsha and \nfollowed her. As soon as she saw him she was \nseized by the same feeling she had had at the \nopera gratified vanity at his admiration of her \nand fear at the absence of a moral barrier be- \ntween them. \n\nHe"lene welcomed Natdsha delightedly and \nwas loud in admiration of her beauty and her \ndress. Soon after their arrival Mademoiselle \nGeorge went out of the room to change her \ncostume. In the drawing room people began \narranging the chairs and taking their seats. \nAnatole moved a chair for Natdsha and was \nabout to sit down beside her, but the count, \nwho never lost sight of her, took the seat him- \nself. Anatole sat down behind her. \n\nMademoiselle George, with her bare, fat, \ndimpled arms, and a red shawl draped over \none shoulder, came into the space left vacant \nfor her, and assumed an unnatural pose. En- \nthusiastic whispering was audible. \n\nMademoiselle George looked sternly and \ngloomily at the audience and began reciting \nsome French verses describing her guilty love \nfor her son. In some places she raised her voice, \nin others she whispered, lifting her head tri- \numphantly; sometimes she paused and uttered \nhoarse sounds, rolling her eyes. \n\n"Adorable! divine! delicious!" was heard \nfrom every side. \n\nNatasha looked at the fat actress, but neither \nsaw nor heard nor understood anything of \nwhat went on before her. She only felt herself \nagain completely borne away into this strange \nsenseless world so remote from her old world \na world in which it was impossible to know \nwhat was good or bad, reasonable or senseless. \nBehind her sat Anatole, and conscious of his \nproximity she experienced a frightened sense \nof expectancy. \n\nAfter the first monologue the whole com- \npany rose and surrounded Mademoiselle \nGeorge, expressing their enthusiasm. \n\n"How beautiful she is!" Natdsha remarked \nto her father who had also risen and was mov- \ning through the crowd toward the actress. \n\n"I don't think so when I look at youl" said \nAnatole, following Natdsha. He said this at a \nmoment when she alone could hear him. "You \nare enchanting . . . from the moment I saw you \nI have never ceased . . ." \n\n\n\nBOOK EIGHT \n\n\n\n325 \n\n\n\n"Come, come, Natdsha!" said the count, as \nhe turned back for his daughter. "How beau- \ntiful she isl" Natasha without saying anything \nstepped up to her father and looked at him \nwith surprised inquiring eyes. \n\nAfter giving several recitations, Mademoi- \nselle George left, and Countess Beziikhova \nasked her visitors into the ballroom. \n\nThe count wished to go home, but He*lene \nentreated him not to spoil her improvised ball, \nand the Rostovs stayed on. Anatole asked Na- \ntasha for a valse and as they danced he pressed \nher waist and hand and told her she was be- \nwitching and that he loved her. During the \nccossaise, which she also danced with him, An- \natole said nothing when they happened to be \nby themselves, but merely gazed at her. Nata- \nsha lifted her frightened eyes to him, but there \nwas such confident tenderness in his affection- \nate look and smile that she could not, whilst \nlooking at him, say what she had to say. She \nlowered her eyes. \n\n"Don't say such things to me. I am betrothed \nand love another," she said rapidly. . . . She \nglanced at him. \n\nAnatole was not upset or pained by what \nshe had said. \n\n"Don't speak to me of that! What can I do?" \nsaid he. "I tell you I am madly, madly, in love \nwith you! Is it my fault that you are enchant- \ning? . . . It's our turn to begin." \n\nNatdsha, animated and excited, looked \nabout her with wide-open frightened eyes and \nseemed merrier than usual. She understood \nhardly anything that went on that evening. \nThey danced the ecossaise and the Grossvater \nHer father asked her to come home, but she \nbegged to remain. Wherever she went and \nwhomever she was speaking to, she felt his eyes \nupon her. Later on she recalled how she had \nasked her father to let her go to the dressing \nroom to rearrange her dress, that Hlene had \nfollowed her and spoken laughingly of her \nbrother's love, and that she again met Anatole \nin the little sitting room. Hlene had disap- \npeared leaving them alone, and Anatole had \ntaken her hand and said in a tender voice: \n\n"I cannot come to visit you but is it possible \nthat I shall never see you? I love you madly. \nCan I never . . . ?" and, blocking her path, he \nbrought his face close to hers. \n\nHis large, glittering, masculine eyes were so \nclose to hers that she saw nothing but them. \n\n"Natalie?" he whispered inquiringly while \nshe felt her hands being painfully pressed. \n"Natalie?" \n\n\n\n"I don't understand. I have nothing to say," \nher eyes replied. \n\nBurning lips were pressed to hers, and at the \nsame instant she felt herself released, and \nHlne's footsteps and the rustle of her dress \nwere heard in the room. Natasha looked round \nat her, and then, red and trembling, threw a \nfrightened look of inquiry at Anatole and \nmoved toward the door. \n\n"One word, just one, for God's sake!" cried \nAnatole. \n\nShe paused. She so wanted a word from him \nthat would explain to her what had happened \nand to which she could find no answer. \n\n"Natalie, just a word, only one!" he kept re- \npeating, evidently not knowing what to say \nand he repeated it till Hlene came up to \nthem. \n\nHe*lenc returned with Natdsha to the draw- \ning room. The Rostovs went away without \nstaying for supper. \n\nAfter reaching home Natasha did not sleep \nall night. She was tormented by the insoluble \nquestion whether she loved Anatole or Prince \nAndrew. She loved Prince Andrew she re- \nmembered distinctly how deeply she loved him. \nBut she also loved Anatole, of that there was \nno doubt. "Else how could all this have hap- \npened?" thought she. "If, after that, I could re- \nturn his smile when saying good-by, if I was \nable to let it come to that, it means that I loved \nhim from the first. It means that he is kind, \nnoble, and splendid, and I could not help lov- \ning him. What am I to do if I love him and the \nother one too?" she asked herself, unable to \nfind an answer to these terrible questions. \n\nCHAPTER XIV \n\nMORNING CAME with its cares and bustle. Every- \none got up and began to move about and talk, \ndressmakers came again. Mdrya Dmitrievna \nappeared, and they were called to breakfast. \nNatasha kept looking uneasily at everybody \nwith wide-open eyes, as if wishing to intercept \nevery glance directed toward her, and tried to \nappear the same as usual. \n\nAfter breakfast, which was her best time, \nMdrya Dmitrievna sat down in her armchair \nand called Natdsha and the count to her. \n\n"Well, friends, I have now thought the whole \nmatter over and this is my advice," she began. \n"Yesterday, as you know, I went to see Prince \n\nBolk6nski. Well, I had a talk with him He \n\ntook it into his head to begin shouting, but I \nam not one to be shouted down. I said what I \nhad to say!" \n\n\n\n3*6 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\n"Well, and he?" asked the count. \n\n"He? He's crazy ... he did not want to listen. \nBut what's the use of talking? As it is we have \nworn the poor girl out," said M^rya Dmf triev- \nna. "My advice to you is finish your business \nand go back home to Otrddnoe . . . and wait \nthere." \n\n"Oh, no!" exclaimed Natasha. \n\n"Yes, go back," said Mrya Dmftrievna,"and \nwait there. If your betrothed comes here now \nthere will be no avoiding a quarrel; but alone \nwith the old man he will talk things over and \nthen come on to you." \n\nCount Rost6v approved of this suggestion, \nappreciating its reasonableness. If the old man \ncame round it would be all the better to visit \nhim in Moscow or at Bald Hills later on; and \nif not, the wedding, against his wishes, could \nonly be arranged at Otrddnoe. \n\n"That is perfectly true. And I am sorry I \nwent to see him and took her," said the old \ncount. \n\n"No, why be sorry? Being here, you had to \npay your respects. But if he won't that's his \naffair," said M^rya Dmhrievna, looking for \nsomething in her reticule. "Besides, the trous- \nseau is ready, so there is nothing to wait for; \nand what is not ready I'll send after you. \nThough I don't like letting you go, it is the \nbest way. So go, with God's blessing!" \n\nHaving found what she was looking for in \nthe reticule she handed it to Natasha. It was a \nletter from Princess Mary. \n\n"She has written to you. How she torments \nherself, poor thing! She's afraid you might \nthink that she does not like you." \n\n"But she doesn't like me," said Natasha. \n\n"Don't talk nonsense!" cried Mrya Dmftri- \nevna. \n\n"I shan't believe anyone, I know she doesn't \nlike me," replied Natisha boldly as she took \nthe letter, and her face expressed a cold and \nangry resolution that caused Mdrya Dmftri- \nevna to look at her more intently and to frown. \n\n"Don't answer like that, my good girl!" she \nsaid. "What I say is true! Write an answer!" \n\nNatasha did not reply and went to her own \nroom to read Princess Mary's letter. \n\nPrincess Mary wrote that she was in despair \nat the misunderstanding that had occurred be- \ntween them. Whatever her father's feelings \nmight be, she begged Natasha to believe that \nshe could not help loving her as the one cho- \nsen by her brother, for whose happiness she \nwas ready to sacrifice everything. \n\n"Do not think, however," she wrote, "that \n\n\n\nmy father is ill-disposed toward you. He is an \ninvalid and an old man who must be forgiven; \nbut he is good and magnanimous and will love \nher who makes his son happy." Princess Mary \nwent on to ask Natasha to fix a time when she \ncould see her again. \n\nAfter reading the letter Natdsha sat down at \nthe writing table to answer it. "Dear Princess," \nshe wrote in French quickly and mechanically, \nand then paused. What more could she write \nafter all that had happened the evening be- \nfore? "Yes, yes! All that has happened, and \nnow all is changed," she thought as she sat with \nthe letter she had begun before her. "Must I \nbreak off with him? Must I really? That's aw- \nful . . ." arid to escape from these dreadful \nthoughts she went to S6nya and began sorting \npatterns with her. \n\nAfter dinner Nat'tsha went to her room and \nagain took up Princess Mary's letter. "Can it \nbe that it is all over?" she thought. "Can it be \nthat all this has happened so quickly and has \ndestroyed all that went before?" She recalled \nher love for Prince Andrew in all its former \nstrength, and at the same time felt that she \nloved Kur^gin. She vividly pictured herself as \nPrince Andrew's wife, and the scenes of happi- \nness with him she had so often repeated in her \nimagination, and at the same time, aglow with \nexcitement, recalled every detail of yesterday's \ninterview with Anatole. \n\n"Why could that not be as well?" she some- \ntimes asked herself in complete bewilderment. \n"Only so could I be completely happy; but \nnow I have to choose, and I can't be happy \nwithout either of them. Only," she thought, \n"to tell Prince Andrew what has happened or \nto hide it from him are both equally impos- \nsible. But with that one nothing is spoiled. \nBut am I really to abandon forever the joy of \nPrince Andrew's love, in which I have lived so \nlong?" \n\n"Please, Miss!" whispered a maid entering \nthe room with a mysterious air. "A man told \nme to give you this" and she handed Natrisha \na letter. \n\n"Only, for Christ's sake . . ." the girl went \non, as Natasha, without thinking, mechanical- \nly broke the seal and read a love letter from \nAnatole, of which, without taking in a word, \nshe understood only that it was a letter from \nhim from the man she loved. Yes, she loved \nhim, or else how could that have happened \nwhich had happened? And how could she have \na love letter from him in her hand? \n\nWith trembling hands Natasha held that \n\n\n\nBOOK \n\npassionate love letter which D61okhov had \ncomposed for Anatole, and as she read it she \nfound in it an echo of all that she herself im- \nagined she was feeling. \n\n"Since yesterday evening my fate has been \nsealed; to be loved by you or to die. There is \nno other way for me," the letter began. Then \nhe went on to say that he knew her parents \nwould not give her to him for this there were \nsecret reasons he could reveal only to her but \nthat if she loved him she need only say the \nword yes, and no human power could hinder \ntheir bliss. Love would conquer all. He would \nsteal her away and carry her off to the ends of \nthe earth. \n\n"Yes, yesl I love him!" thought Natasha, \nreading the letter for the twentieth time and \nfinding some peculiarly deep meaning in each \nword of it. \n\nThat evening Mdrya Dmftrievna was going \nto the Akhdrovs' and proposed to take the \ngirls with her. Natasha, pleading a headache, \nremained at home. \n\nCHAPTER XV \n\nON RETURNING late in the evening Sonya went \nto Natasha's room, and to her surprise found \nher still dressed and asleep on the sofa. Open \non the table beside her lay Anatole's letter. \nSonya picked it up and read it. \n\nAs she read she glanced at the sleeping Na- \ntdsha, trying to find in her face an explanation \nof what she was reading, but did not find it. \nHer face was calm, gentle, and happy. Clutch- \ning her breast to keep herself from choking, \nSonya, pale and trembling with fear and agi- \ntation, sat down in an armchair and burst into \ntears. \n\n"How was it I noticed nothing? How could \nit go so far? Can she have left off loving Prince \nAndrew? And how could she let Kuragin go to \nsuch lengths? He is a deceiver and a villain, \nthat's plain! What will Nicholas, dear noble \nNicholas, do when he hears of it? So this is the \nmeaning of her excited, resolute, unnatural \nlook the day before yesterday, yesterday, and \ntoday," thought S6nya. "But it can't be that \nshe loves him! She probably opened the letter \nwithout knowing who it was from. Probably \nshe is offended by it. She could not do such a \nthing!" \n\nS6nya wiped away her tears and went up to \nNatasha, again scanning her face. \n\n"Natdsha 1" she said, just audibly. \n\nNatdsha awoke and saw S6nya. \n\n"Ah, you're back?" \n\n\n\nEIGHT 327 \n\nAnd with the decision and tenderness that \noften come at the moment of awakening, she \nembraced her friend, but noticing S6nya's \nlook of embarrassment, her own face expressed \nconfusion and suspicion. \n\nilS6nya, you've read that letter?" she de- \nmanded. \n\n"Yes," answered Sonya softly. \n\nNatasha smiled rapturously. \n\n"No, S6nya, I can't any longer!" she said. "I \ncan't hide it from you any longer. You know, \nwe love one another! S6nya, darling, he writes \n. . . S6nya . . ." \n\nS6nya stared open-eyed at Natdsha, unable \nto believe her ears. \n\n"And Bolk6nski?" she asked. \n\n"Ah, Sonya, if you only knew how happy I \nam!" cried Natdsha. "You don't know what \nlove is " \n\n"But, Natasha, can that be all over?" \n\nNatasha looked at Sonya with wide-open \neyes as if she could not grasp the question. \n\n"Well, then, are you refusing Prince An- \ndrew?" said Sonya. \n\n"Oh, you don't understand anything! Don't \ntalk nonsense, just listen!" said Natdsha, with \nmomentary vexation. \n\n"But I can't believe it," insisted Sonya. "I \ndon't understand. How is it you have loved a \nman for a whole year and suddenly . . . Why, \nyou have only seen him three times! Natdsha, \nI don't believe you, you're joking! In three \ndays to forget everything and so . . ." \n\n"Three days?" said Natdsha. "It seems to me \nI've loved him a hundred years. It seems to me \nthat I have never loved anyone before. You \ncan't understand it. ... S6nya, wait a bit, sit \nhere," and Natdsha embraced and kissed her. \n\n"I had heard that it happens like this, and \nyou must have heard it too, but it's only now \nthat I feel such love. It's not the same as be- \nfore. As soon as I saw him I felt he was my mas- \nter and I his slave, and that I could not help \nloving him. Yes, his slave! Whatever he orders \nI shall do. You don't understand that. What \ncan I do? What can I do, Sonya?" cried Natd- \nsha with a happy yet frightened expression. \n\n"But think what you are doing," cried Son- \nya. "I can't leave it like this. This secret cor- \nrespondence . . . How could you let him go so \nfar?" she went on, with a horror and disgust \nshe could hardly conceal. \n\n"I told you that I have no will," Natdsha re- \nplied. "Why can't you understand? I love him I" \n\n"Then I won't let it come to that ... I shall \ntelll" cried S6nya, bursting into tears. \n\n\n\n328 \n\n\n\n"What do you mean? For God's sake ... If \nyou tell, you are my enemy!" declared Nat- \nsha. "You want me to be miserable, you want \nus to be separated " \n\nWhen she saw Natasha's fright, S6nya shed \ntears of shame and pity for her friend. \n\n"But what has happened between you?" she \nasked. "What has he said to you? Why doesn't \nhe come to the house?" \n\nNatdsha did not answer her questions. \n\n"For God's sake, S6nya, don't tell anyone, \ndon't torture me," Natdsha entreated. "Re- \nmember no one ought to interfere in such mat- \nters! I have confided in you. . . ." \n\n"But why this secrecy? Why doesn't he come \nto the house?" asked S6nya. "Why doesn't he \nopenly ask for your hand? You know Prince \nAndrew gave you complete freedom if it is \nreally so; but I don't believe it! Natasha, have \nyou considered what these secret reasons can \nbe?" \n\nNatasha looked at S6nya with astonishment. \nEvidently this question presented itself to her \nmind for the first time and she did not know \nhow to answer it. \n\n"I don't know what the reasons are. But \nthere must be reasons!" \n\nS6nya sighed and shook her head incredu- \nlously. \n\n"If there were reasons ..." she began. \n\nBut Natasha, guessing her doubts, inter- \nrupted her in alarm. \n\n"S6nya, one can't doubt him! One can't, one \ncan't! Don't you understand?" she cried. \n\n"Does he love you?" \n\n"Does he love me?" Natasha repeated with a \nsmile of pity at her friend's lack of comprehen- \nsion. "Why, you have read his letter and you \nhave seen him." \n\n"But if he is dishonorable?" \n\n"He! dishonorable? If you only knew!" ex- \nclaimed Natasha. \n\n"If he is an honorable man he should either \ndeclare his intentions or cease seeing you; and \nif you won't do this, I will. I will write to him, \nand I will tell Papal" said Sonya resolutely. \n\n"But I can't live without him!" cried Nata- \nsha. \n\n"Natdsha, I don't understand you. And what \nare you saying! Think of your father and of \nNicholas." \n\n"I don't want anyone, I don't love anyone \nbut him. How dare you say he is dishonorable? \nDon't you know that I love him?" screamed \nNatisha. "Go away, S6nya! I don't want to \nquarrel with you, but go, for God's sake got \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\nYou see how I am suffering!" Natasha cried \nangrily, in a voice of despair and repressed ir- \nritation. S6nya burst into sobs and ran from \nthe room. \n\nNatasha went to the table and without a \nmoment's reflection wrote that answer to Prin- \ncess Mary which she had been unable to write \nall the morning. In this letter she said briefly \nthat all their misunderstandings were at an \nend; that availing herself of the magnanimity \nof Prince Andrew who when he went abroad \nhad given her her freedom, she begged Prin- \ncess Mary to forget everything and forgive her \nif she had been to blame toward her, but that \nshe could not be his wife. At that moment this \nall seemed quite easy, simple, and clear to Na- \ntdsha. \n\n\n\nOn Friday the Rostovs were to return to the \ncountry, but on Wednesday the count went \nwith the prospective purchaser to his estate \nnear Moscow. \n\nOn the day the count left, S6nya and Natl- \nsha were invited to a big dinner party at the \nKardgins', and Mrya Dmftrievna took them \nthere. At that party Natasha again met Ana- \ntole, and S6nya noticed that she spoke to him, \ntrying not to be overheard, and that all through \ndinner she was more agitated than ever. When \nthey got home Natasha was the first to begin \nthe explanation Sonya expected. \n\n"There, S6nya, you were talking all sorts of \nnonsense about him," Natasha began in a mild \nvoice such as children use when they wish to be \npraised. "We have had an explanation today." \n\n"Well, what happened? What did he say? \nNatdsha, how glad I am you're not angry with \nme! Tell me everything the whole truth. What \ndid he say?" \n\nNatdsha became thoughtful. \n\n"Oh,S6nya, if you knew him as I do! He said \n. . . He asked me what I had promised Bolk6n- \nski. He was glad I was free to refuse him." \n\nS6nya sighed sorrowfully. \n\n"But you haven't refused Bolk6nski?" said \nshe. \n\n"Perhaps I have. Perhaps all is over between \nme and Bolk6nski. Why do you think so badly \nof me?" \n\n"I don't think anything, only I don't under- \nstand this . . ." \n\n"Wait a bit, S6nya, you'll understand every- \nthing. You'll see what a man he is! Now don't \nthink badly ot me or of him. I don't think bad- \nly of anyone: I love and pity everybody. But \nwhat am I to do?" \n\n\n\nBOOK EIGHT \n\n\n\nS6nya did not succumb to the tender tone \nNatdsha used toward her. The more emotional \nand ingratiating the expression of Natasha's \nface became, the more serious and stern grew \nS6nya's. \n\n"Natasha," said she, "you asked me not to \nspeak to you, and I haven't spoken, but now \nyou yourself have begun. I don't trust him, Na- \ntdsha. Why this secrecy?" \n\n"Again, again!" interrupted Natasha. \n\n"Natdsha, I am afraid for you!" \n\n"Afraid of what?" \n\n"I am afraid you're going to your ruin," said \nS6nya resolutely, and was herself horrified at \nwhat she had said. \n\nAnger again showed in Natasha's face. \n\n"And I'll go to my ruin, I will, as soon as pos- \nsible! It's not your business! It won't be you, \nbut I, who'll suffer. Leave rne alone, leave me \nalone! I hate you!" \n\n"Natasha!" moaned Sonya, aghast. \n\n"I hate you, I hate you! You're myenemy for- \never!" And Natasha ran out of the room. \n\nNatdsha did not speak to Sonya again and \navoided her. With the same expression of agi- \ntated surprise and guilt she went about the \nhouse, taking up now one occupation, now an- \nother, and at once abandoning them. \n\nHard as it was for Sonya, she watched her \nfriend and did not let her out of her sight. \n\nThe day before the count was to return, Son- \nya noticed that Natdsha sat by the drawing- \nroom window all the morning as if expecting \nsomething and that she made a sign to an offi- \ncer who drove past, whom Sonya took to be \nAnatolc. \n\nSonya began watching her friend still more \nattentively and noticed that at dinner and all \nthat evening Natdsha was in a strange and un- \nnatural state. She answered questions at ran- \ndom, began sentences she did not finish, and \nlaughed at everything. \n\nAfter tea Sonya noticed a housemaid at Na- \ntdsha's door timidly waiting to let her pass. She \nlet the girl go in, and then listening at the door \nlearned that another letter had beendelivered. \n\nThen suddenly it became clear to Sonya that \nNatdsha had some dreadful plan for that eve- \nning. Sonya knocked at her door. Natdsha did \nnot let her in. \n\n"She will run away with him!" thought S6n- \nya. "She is capable of anything. There was \nsomething particularly pathetic and resolute \nin her face today. She cried as she said good-by \nto Uncle," Sonya remembered. "Yes, that's it, \nshe means to elope with him, but what am I to \n\n\n\n329 \n\n\n\ndo?" thought she, recalling all the signs that \nclearly indicated that Natdsha had some ter- \nrible intention. "The count is away. What am \nI to do? Write to Kurdgin demanding an ex- \nplanation? But what is there to oblige him to \nreply? Write to Pierre, as Prince Andrew asked \nme to in case of some misfortune? . . . But per- \nhaps she really has already refused Bolk6nski \nshe sent a letter to Princess Mary yesterday. \n\nAnd Uncle is away " To tell Mdrya Dmftri- \n\nevna who had such faith in Natdsha seemed to \nS6nya terrible. "Well, anyway," thought Son- \nya as she stood in the dark passage, "now or \nnever I must prove that I remember the fam- \nily's goodness to me and that I love Nicholas. \nYes! If I don't sleep for three nights I'll not \nleave this passage and will hold her back by \nforce and not let the family be disgraced," \nthought she. \n\nCHAPTER XVI \n\nANATOLE had lately moved to D61okhov's. The \nplan for Natalie Rostova's abduction had been \narranged and the preparations made by D61o- \nkhov a few days before, and on the day that \nSonya, after listening at Natdsha's door, re- \nsolved to safeguard her, it was to have been put \ninto execution. Natdsha had promised to come \nout to Kurdgin at the back porch at ten that \nevening. Kurdgin was to put her into a troyka \nhe would have ready and to drive her forty \nmiles to the village of Kdmenka, where an un- \nfrocked priest was in readiness to perform a \nmarriage ceremony over them. At Kdmenka a \nrelay of horses was to wait which would take \nthem to the Warsaw highroad, and from there \nthey would hasten abroad with post horses. \n\nAnatole had a passport, an order for post \nhorses, ten thousand rubles he had taken from \nhis sister and another ten thousand borrowed \nwith Dolokhov's help. \n\nTwo witnesses for the mock marriage Khvos- \ntikov, a retired petty official whom Dolokhov \nmade use of in his gambling transactions, and \nMakdrin, a retired hussar, a kindly, weak fel- \nlow who had an unbounded affection for Kura- \ngin were sitting at tea in Dolokhov's front \nroom. \n\nIn his large study, the walls of which were \nhung to the ceiling with Persian rugs, bear- \nskins, and weapons, sat D61okhov in a travel- \ning cloak and high boots, at an open desk on \nwhich lay an abacus and some bundles of paper \nmoney. Anatole, with uniform unbuttoned, \nwalked to and fro from the room where the \nwitnesses were sitting, through the study to the \n\n\n\n33 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nroom behind, where his French valet and oth- \ners were packing the last of his things. D61o- \nkhovwas counting themoneyand noting some- \nthing down. \n\n"Well," he said, "Khv6stikov must have two \nthousand." \n\n"Give it to him, then," said Anatole. \n\n"Makdrka" (their name for Makdrin) "will \ngo through fire and water for you for nothing. \nSo here are our accounts all settled," said \nDdlokhov, showing him the memorandum. "Is \nthat right?" \n\n"Yes, of course," returned Anatole, evident- \nly not listening to D61okhov and looking \nstraight before him with a smile that did not \nleave his face. \n\nD61okhov banged down the lid of his desk \nand turned to Anatole with an ironic smile: \n\n"Do you know? You'd really better drop it \nall. There's still time!" \n\n"Fool," retorted Anatole. "Don't talk non- \nsense I If you only knew . . . it's the devil knows \nwhat!" \n\n"No, really, give it up! "said D61okhov."I am \nspeaking seriously. It's no joke, this plot you've \nhatched." \n\n"What, teasing agaia? Go to the devil! Eh?" \nsaid Anatole, making a grimace. "Really it's no \ntime for your stupid jokes," and he left the \nroom. \n\nD61okhov smiled contemptuously and con- \ndescendingly when Anatole had gone out. \n\n"You wait a bit," he called after him. "I'm \nnot joking, I'm talking sense. Come here, come \nhere!" \n\nAnatole returned and looked at D61okhov, \ntrying to give him his attention and evidently \nsubmitting to him involuntarily. \n\n"Now listen to me. I'm telling you this for the \nlast time. Why should I joke about it? Did I \nhinder you? Who arranged everything for you? \nWho found the priest and got the passport? \nWho raised the money? I did it all." \n\n"Well, thank you for it. Do you think I am \nnot grateful?" And Anatole sighed and em- \nbraced D61okhov. \n\n"I helped you, but all the same I must tell \nyou the truth; it is a dangerous business, and if \nyou think about it a stupid business. Well, \nyou'll carry her off all right! Will they let it \nstop at that? It will come out that you're al- \nready married. Why, they'll have you in the \ncriminal court. . . ." \n\n"Oh, nonsense, nonsense!" Anatole ejaculat- \ned and again made a grimace. "Didn't I ex- \nplain to you? What?" And Anatole, with the \n\n\n\npartiality dull-witted people have for any con- \nclusion they have reached by their own reason- \ning, repeated the argument he had already put \nto D61okhov a hundred times. "Didn't I ex- \nplain to you that I have come to this conclu- \nsion: if this marriage is invalid," he went on, \ncrooking one finger, "then I have nothing to \nanswer for; but if it is valid, no matter! Abroad \nno one will know anything about it. Isn't that \nso? And don't talk to me, don't, don't." \n\n"Seriously, you'd better drop it! You'll only \nget yourself into a mess!" \n\n"Go to the devil!" cried Anatole and, clutch- \ning his hair, left the room, but returned at \nonce and dropped into an armchair in front of \nD61okhov with his feet tucked under him. "It's \nthe very devil! What? Feel how it beats!" He \ntook D61okhov's hand and put it on his heart. \n"What a foot, my dear fellow! What a glance! \nA goddess!" he added in French. "What?" \n\nD61okhov with a cold smile and a gleam in \nhis handsome insolent eyes looked at him evi- \ndently wishing to get some more amusement \nout of him. \n\n"Well and when the .money's gone, what \nthen?" \n\n"What then? Eh?" repeated Anatole, sincere- \nly perplexed by a thought of the future. "What \n\nthen? . . . Then, I don't know But why talk \n\nnonsense!" He glanced at his watch. "It'stime!" \n\nAnatole went into the back room. \n\n"Now then I Nearly ready? You're dawdling! " \nhe shouted to the servants. \n\nD61okhov put away the money, called a foot- \nman whom he ordered to bring something for \nthem to eat and drink before the journey, and \nwent into the room where Khv6stikov and \nMakrin were sitting. \n\nAnatole lay on the sofa in the study leaning \non his elbow and smiling pensively, while his \nhandsome lips muttered tenderly to himself. \n\n"Come and eat something. Have a drink!" \nD61okhov shouted to him from the other room. \n\n"I don't want to," answered Anatole contin- \nuing to smile. \n\n"Come! Balagd is here." \n\nAnatole rose and went into the dining room. \nBalagd was a famous troyka driver who had \nknown D61okhov and Anatole some six years \nand had given them good service with his troy- \nkas. More than once when Anatole's regiment \nwas stationed at Tver he had taken him from \nTver in the evening, brought him to Moscow \nby daybreak, and driven him back again the \nnext night. More than once he had enabled \nDblokhov to escape when pursued. More than \n\n\n\nBOOK EIGHT \n\n\n\n33* \n\n\n\nonce he had driven them through the town with \ngypsies and "ladykins"as he called thecocottes. \nMore than once in their service he had run \nover pedestrians and upset vehicles in the \nstreets of Moscow and had always been pro- \ntected from the consequences by "my gentle- \nmen" as he called them. He had ruined more \nthan one horse in theirservice. More than once \nthey had beaten him, and more than once they \nhad made him drunk on champagne and Ma- \ndeira, which he loved; and he knew more than \none thing about each of them which would \nlong ago have sent an ordinary man to Siberia. \nThey often called Balagd into their orgies and \nmade him drink and dance at the gypsies', and \nmore than one thousand rubles of their money \nhad passed through his hands. In their service \nhe risked his skin and his life twenty times a \nyear, and in their service had lost more horses \nthan the money he had from them would buy. \nBut he liked them; liked that mad driving at \ntwelve miles an hour, liked upsetting a driver \nor running down a pedestrian, and flying at \nfull gallop through the Moscow streets. He \nliked to hear those wild, tipsy shouts behind \nhim: "Get on! Get on!" when it was impossible \nto go any faster. He liked giving a painful lash \non the neck to some peasant who, more dead \nthan alive, was already hurrying out of his \nway. "Real gentlemen!" he considered them. \n\nAnatole and D61okhov liked Balagd too for \nhis masterly driving and because he liked the \nthings they liked. With others Balagd bargained, \ncharging twenty-five rubles for a two hours' \ndrive, and rarely drove himself, generally let- \nting his young men do so. But with "his gentle- \nmen" he always drove himself and never de- \nmanded anything for his work. Only a couple \nof times a year when he knew from their val- \nets that they had money in hand he would turn \nup of a morning quite sober and with a deep \nbow would ask them to help him. The gentle- \nmen always made him sit down. \n\n"Do help me out, Theodore Ivdnych, sir," or \n"your excellency," he would say. "I am quite \nout of horses. Let me have what you can to go \nto the fair." \n\nAnd Anatole and D61okhov, when they had \nmoney, would give him a thousand or a couple \nof thousand rubles. \n\nBalagd was a fair-haired, short, and snub- \nnosed peasantof about twenty-seven; red-faced, \nwith a particularly red thick neck, glittering \nlittle eyes, and a small beard. He wore a fine, \ndark-blue, silk-lined cloth coat over a sheep- \nskin. \n\n\n\nOn entering the room now he crossed him- \nself, turning toward the front corner of the \nroom, and went up to D61okhov, holding out a \nsmall, black hand. \n\n"Theodore Ivdnych I" he said, bowing. \n** "How d'you do, friend? Well, here he is!" \n\n"Good day, your excellency!" he said, again \nholding out his hand to Anatole who had just \ncome in. \n\n"I say, Balagd," said Anatole, putting his \nhands on the man's shoulders, "do you care for \nme or not? Eh? Now, do me a service. . . . What \nhorses have you come with? Eh?" \n\n"As your messenger ordered, your special \nbeasts," replied Balagd. \n\n"Well, listen, Balaga! Drive all three to \ndeath but get me there in three hours. Eh?" \n\n"When they are dead, what shall I drive?" \nsaid Balagd with a wink. \n\n"Mind, I'll smash your face in! Don't make \njokes! "cried Anatole, suddenly rolling his eyes. \n\n"Why joke?" said the driver, laughing. "As if \nI'd grudge my gentlemen anything! As fast as \never the horses can gallop, so fast we'll go!" \n\n"Ah!" said Anatole. "Well, sit down." \n\n"Yes, sit down!" said D61okhov. \n\n"I'll stand, Theodore Ivdnych." \n\n"Sit down; nonsense! Have a drink!" said \nAnatole, and filled a large glass of Madeira for \nhim. \n\nThe driver's eyes sparkled at the sight of the \nwine. After refusing it for manners' sake, he \ndrank it and wiped his mouth with a red silk \nhandkerchief he took out of his cap. \n\n"And when are we to start, your excellency?" \n\n"Well . . ." Anatole looked at his watch. \n"We'll start at once. Mind, Balagd! You'll get \nthere in time? Eh?" \n\n"That depends on our luck in starting, else \nwhy shouldn't we be there in time?" replied \nBalagd. "Didn't we get you to Tver in seven \nhours? I think you remember that, your ex- \ncellency?" \n\n"Do you know, one Christmas I drove from \nTver," said Anatole, smiling at the recollection \nand turning to Makdrin who gazed rapturous- \nly at him with wide-open eyes. "Will you be- \nlieve it, Makdrka, it took one's breath away, \nthe rate we flew. We came across a train of \nloaded sleighs and drove right over two of them. \nEh?" \n\n"Those were horses!" Balagd continued the \ntale. "That time I'd harnessed two young side \nhorses with the bay in the shafts," he went on, \nturning to Ddlokhov. "Will you believe it, \nTheodore Ivdnych, those animals flew forty \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nmiles? I couldn't hold them in, my hands grew \nnumb in the sharp frost so that I threw down \nthe reins 'Catch hold yourself, your excellen- \ncy!' says I, and I just tumbled on the bottom of \nthe sleigh and sprawled there. It wasn't a case \nof urging them on, there was no holding them \nin till we reached the place. The devils took \nus there in three hours! Only the neurone died \nof it." \n\nCHAPTER XVII \n\nANATOLE went out of the room and returned \na few minutes later wearing a fur coat girt with \na silver belt, and a sable cap jauntily set on one \nside and very becoming to his handsome face. \nHaving looked in a mirror, and standing before \nD61okhov in the same pose he had assumed be- \nfore it, he lifted a glass of wine. \n\n''Well, good-by, Theodore. Thank you for \neverything and farewell!" said Anatole. "Well, \ncomrades and friends . . ." he considered for a \nmoment ". . . of my youth, farewell!" he said, \nturning to Makdrin and the others. \n\nThough they were all going with him, An- \natole evidently wished to make something \ntouching and solemn out of this address to his \ncomrades. He spoke slowly in a loud voice and \nthrowing out his chest slightly swayed one leg. \n\n"All take glasses; you too, Balagd. Well, com- \nrades and friends of my youth, we've had our \nfling and lived and reveled. Eh? And now, \nwhen shall we meet again? I am going abroad. \nWe have had a good time now farewell, ladsl \nTo our health! Hurra 'i! . . ." he cried, and emp- \ntying his glass flung it on the floor. \n\n"Tp your health!" said Balagd who also emp- \ntied kis glass, and wiped his mouth with his \nhandkerchief. \n\nMakdrin embraced Anatole with tears in his \neyes. \n\n"Ah, Prince, how sorry I am to part from \nyou!" \n\n"Let's go. Let's go!" cried Anatole. \n\nBalagd was about to leave the room. \n\n"No, stop!" said Anatole. "Shut the door; we \nhave first to sit down. That's the way." \n\nThey shut the door and all sat down. 1 \n\n"Now, quick march, lads!" said Anatole, ris- \ning- \nJoseph, his valet, handed him his sabretache \nand saber, and they all went out into the vesti- \nbule. \n\n"And where's the fur cloak?" asked Dolo- \n\n1 This is in accord with a Russian superstition \nas to what should be done when starting on a \njourney. TR. \n\n\n\nkhov. "Hey, Igndtkal Go to Matrena Matr^vna \nand ask her for the sable cloak. I have heard \nwhat elopements are like," continued D61okhov \nwith a wink. "Why, she'll rush out more dead \nthan alive just in the things she is wearing; if \nyou delay at all there'll be tears and 'Papa' and \n'Mamma,' and she's frozen in a minute and \nmust go back but you wrap the fur cloak \nround her first thing and carry her to the sleigh." \n\nThe valet brought a woman's fox-lined cloak. \n\n"Fool, I told you the sable one! Hey, Matrena, \nthe sable!" he shouted so that his voice rang \nfar through the rooms. \n\nA handsome, slim, and pale-faced gypsy girl \nwith glittering black eyes and curly blue-black \nhair, wearing a red shawl, ran out with a sable \nmantle on her arm. \n\n"Here, I don't grudge it take it!" she said, \nevidently afraid of her master and yet regret- \nful of her cloak. \n\nDolokhov, without answering, took the cloak, \nthrew it over Matrena, and wrapped her up in \nit. \n\n"That's the way," said D61okhov, "and then \nso!" arid he turned the collar up round her \nhead, leavingonlya littleof the face uncovered. \n"And then so, do you see?" and he pushed An- \natole's head forward to meet the gap left by \nthe collar, through which Matrena's brilliant \nsmile was seen. \n\n"Well, good-by, Matrena," said Anatole, \nkissing her. "Ah, my revels here are over. Re- \nmember me to Stcshka. There, good-by! Good- \nby, Matrena, wish me luck!" \n\n"Well, Prince, may God give you great luck!" \nsaid Matrena in her gypsy accent. \n\nTwo troykas were standing before the porch \nand two young drivers were holding the horses. \nBalagd took his seat in the front one and hold- \ning his elbows high arranged the reins deliber- \nately. Anatole and Dolokhov got in with him. \nMakdrin, Khvostikov, and a valet seated them- \nselves in the other sleigh. \n\n"Well, are you ready?" asked Balagd. \n\n"Go!" he cried, twisting the reins round his \nhands, and the troyka tore down the Nikftski \nBoulevard. \n\n"Tproo! Get out of the way! Hi! . . . Tproo! \n. . ." The shouting of Balagd and of the sturdy \nyoung fellow seated on the box was all that \ncould be heard. On the Arbdt Square the troy- \nka caught against a carnage; something cracked, \nshouts were heard, and the troyka flew along \nthe Arbdt Street. \n\nAfter taking a turn along the Podnovinski \nBoulevard, Balagd began to rein in, and turn- \n\n\n\ning back drew up at the crossing of the old \nKonyusheny Street. \n\nThe young fellow on the box jumped down \nto hold the horses and Anatole and D61okhov \nwent along the pavement. When they reached \nthe gate D61okhov whistled. The whistle was \nanswered, and a maidservant ran out. \n\n"Come into the courtyard or you'll be seen; \nshe'll come out directly," said she. \n\nD61okhov stayed by the gate. Anatole fol- \nlowed the maid into the courtyard, turned the \ncorner, and ran up into the porch. \n\nHe was met by Gabriel, Mdrya Dmitrievna's \ngigantic footman. \n\n"Come to the mistress, please," said the foot- \nman in his deep bass, intercepting any retreat. \n\n"To what mistress? Who are you?" asked An- \natole in a breathless whisper. \n\n"Kindly step in, my orders are to bring you \nin." \n\n"Kurginl Come backl" shouted D61okhov. \n"Betrayed! Back!" \n\nDolokhov, after Anatole entered, had re- \nmained at the wicket gate and was struggling \nwith the yard porter who was trying to lock it. \nWith a last desperate effort Dolokhov pushed \nthe porter aside, and when Anatole ran back \nseized him by the arm, pulled him through the \nwicket, and ran back with him to the troyka. \n\nCHAPTER XVIII \n\nMARYA DMITRIEVN A, having found S6nya weep- \ning in the corridor, made her confess every- \nthing, and intercepting the note to Natasha she \nread it and went into Natasha's room with it \nin her hand. \n\n"You shameless good-for-nothing!" said she. \n"I won't hear a word." \n\nPushing back Natasha who looked at her \nwith astonished but tearless eyes, she locked \nher in; and having given orders to the yard \nporter to admit the persons who would be com- \ning that evening, but not to let them out again, \nand having told the footman to bring them up \nto her, she seated herself in the drawing room to \nawait the abductors. \n\nWhen Gabriel came to inform her that the \nmen who had come had run away again, she \nrose frowning, and clasping her hands behind \nher paced through the rooms a long time con- \nsidering what she should do. Toward midnight \nshe went to Natasha's room fingering the key \nin her pocket. S6nya was sitting sobbing in the \ncorridor. "MArya Dmitrievna, for God's sake \nlet me in to herl" she pleaded, but Mdrya \nDmitrievna unlocked the door and went in \n\n\n\nBOOK EIGHT 333 \n\nwithout giving her an answer. . . . "Disgusting, \n\n\n\nabominable ... In my house . . . horrid girl, \nhussy! I'm only sorry for her father!" thought \nshe, trying to restrain her wrath. "Hard as it \nmay be, I'll tell them all to hold their tongues \na^nd will hide it from the count." She entered \nthe room with resolute steps. Natasha was lying \non the sofa, her head hidden in her hands, and \nshe did not stir. She was in just the same posi- \ntion in which Marya Dmitrievna had left her. \n\n"A nice girl! Very nice!" said Marya Dmi- \ntrievna. "Arranging meetings with lovers in my \nhouse! It's no use pretending: you listen when \nI speak to you!" And Marya Dmitrievna \ntouched her arm. "Listen when I speak! You've \ndisgraced yourself like the lowest of hussies. \nI'd treat you differently, but I'm sorry for your \nfather, so I will conceal it." \n\nNatasha did not change her position, but her \nwhole body heaved with noiseless, convulsive \nsobs which choked her. Marya Dmitrievna \nglanced round at Sonya and seated herself on \nthe sofa beside Natasha. \n\n"It's lucky for him that he escaped me; but \nI'll find him!" she said in her rough voice. "Do \nyou hear what I am saying or not?" she added. \n\nShe put her large hand under Natasha's \nface and turned it toward her. Both Marya \nDmitrievna and Sonya were amazed when they \nsaw how Natasha looked. Her eyes were dry \nand glistening, her lips compressed, her cheeks \nsunken. \n\n"Let me be! ... What is- it to me? ... I shall \ndie!" she muttered, wrenching herself from \nMdrya Dmitrievna's hands with a vicious ef- \nfort and sinking down again into her former \nposition. \n\n"Natalie!" said Mrya Dmitrievna. "I wish \nfor your good. Lie still, stay like that then, I \nwon't touch you. But listen. I won't tell you \nhow guilty you are. You know that yourself. \nBut when your father comes back tomorrow- \nwhat am I to tell him? Eh?" \n\nAgain Natasha's body shook with sobs. \n\n"Suppose he finds out, and your brother, \nand your betrothed?" \n\n"I have no betrothed: I have refused him!" \ncried Natasha. \n\n"That's all the same," continued Mdrya Dmi- \ntrievna. "If they hear of this, will they let it pass? \nHe, your father, I know him ... if he chal- \nlenges him to a duel will that be all right? Eh?" \n\n"Oh, let me be! Why have you interfered at \nall? Why? Why? Who asked you to?" shouted \nNatisha, raising herself on the sofa and look- \ning malignantly at M&amp;rya Dmitrievna. \n\n\n\n334 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\n"But what did you want?" cried Mdrya Dmf- \ntrievna, growing angry again. "Were you kept \nunder lock and key? Who hindered his coming \nto the house? Why carry you off as if you were \nsome gypsy singing girl? . . . Well, if he had car- \nried you off ... do you think they wouldn't \nhave found him? Your father, or brother, or \nyour betrothed? And he's a scoundrel, a wretch \nthat's a fact!" \n\n"He is better than any of you!" exclaimed \nNatdsha getting up. "If you hadn't interfered \n. . . Oh, my God! What is it all? What is it? \nSonya, why? ... Go away!" \n\nAnd she burst into sobs with the despairing \nvehemence with which people bewail disasters \nthey feel they have themselves occasioned. \nMdrya Dmftrievna was about to speak again, \nbut Natdsha cried out: \n\n"Go away! Go away! You all hate and despise \nme!" and she threw herself back on the sofa. \n\nMdrya Dmitrievnawent on admonishing her \nfor some time, en joining on her that it must all \nbe kept from her father and assuring her that \nnobody would know anything about it if only \nNatdsha herself would undertake to forget it \nall and not let anyone see that something had \nhappened. Natdsha did not reply, nor did she \nsob any longer, but she grew cold and had a \nshivering fit. Mdrya Dmitrievna put a pillow \nunder her head, covered her with two quilts, \nand herself brought her some lime-flower wa- \nter, but Natdsha did not respond to her. \n\n"Well, let her sleep," said Mdrya Dmitriev- \nna as she went out of the room supposing Na- \ntdsha to be asleep. \n\nBut Natdsha was not asleep; with pale face \nand fixed wide-open eyes she looked straight \nbefore her. All that night she did not sleep or \nweep and did not speak to S6nya who got up \nand went to her several times. \n\nNext day Count Rostov returned from his \nestate near Moscow in time for lunch as he had \npromised. He was in very good spirits; the af- \nfair with the purchaser was going on satisfac- \ntorily, and there was nothing to keep him any \nlonger in Moscow, away from the countess \nwhom he missed. Mdrya Dmftrievna met him \nand told him that Natdsha had been very un- \nwell the day before and that they had sent for \nthe doctor, but that she was better now. Na- \ntdsha had not left her room that morning. With \ncompressed and parched lips and dry fixed \neyes, she sat at the window, uneasily watching \nthe people who drove past and hurriedly glanc- \ning round at anyone who entered the room. \nShe was evidently expecting news of him and \n\n\n\nthat he would come or would write to her. \n\nWhen the count came to see her she turned \nanxiously round at the sound of a man's foot- \nstep, and then her face resumed its cold and \nmalevolent expression. She did not even get up \nto greet him. \n\n"What is the matter with you, my angel? Are \nyou ill?" asked the count. \n\nAfter a moment's silence Natdsha answered: \n"Yes, ill." \n\nIn reply to the count's anxious inquiries as \nto why she was so dejected and whether any- \nthing had happened to her betrothed, she as- \nsured him that nothinghad happened and asked \nhim not to worry. Mdrya Dmftrievna confirmed \nNatdsha's assurances that nothing had hap- \npened. From the pretense of illness, from his \ndaughter's distress, and by the embarrassed \nfaces of Sonya and Mdrya Dmftrievna, the \ncount saw clearly that something had gone \nwrong during his absence, but it was so terrible \nfor him to think that anything disgraceful had \nhappened to his beloved daughter, and he so \nprized his own cheerful tranquillity, that he \navoided inquiries and tried to assure himself \nthat nothing particularly had happened; and \nhe was only dissatisfied that her indisposition \ndelayed their return to the country. \n\nCHAPTER XIX \n\nFROM THE DAY his wife arrived in Moscow \nPierre had been intending to go away some- \nwhere, so as not to be near her. Soon after the \nRostovs came to Moscow the effect Natdsha \nhad on him made him hasten to carry out his \nintention. He went to Tver to see Joseph \nAlexe*evich's widow, who had long since prom- \nised to hand over to him some papers of her \ndeceased husband's. \n\nWhen he returned to Moscow Pierre was \nhanded a letter from Mdrya Dmftrievna ask- \ning him to come and see her on a matter of \ngreat importance relating to Andrew Bolkon- \nski and his betrothed. Pierre had been avoid- \ning Natdsha because it seemed to him that his \nfeeling for her was stronger than a married \nman's should be for his friend's fiancde. Yet \nsome fate constantly threw them together. \n\n"What can have happened? And what can \nthey want with me?" thought he ashedressedto \ngo to Mdrya Dmftrievna's. "If only Prince An- \ndrew would hurry up and come and marry her I" \nthought he on his way to the house. \n\nOn the Tversk6y Boulevard a familiar voice \ncalled to him. \n\n"Pierre! Been back long?" someone shouted. \n\n\n\nBOOK EIGHT \n\n\n\n335 \n\n\n\nPierre raised his head. In a sleigh drawn by two \ngray trotting-horses that were bespattering the \ndashboard with snow, Anatole and his constant \ncompanion Makdrin dashed past. Anatole was \nsitting upright in the classic pose of military \ndandies, the lower part of his face hidden by \nhis beaver collar and his head slightly bent. His \nface was fresh and rosy, his white-plumed hat, \ntilted to one side, disclosed his curled and po- \nmaded hair besprinkled with powdery snow. \n\n"Yes, indeed, that's a true sage," thought \nPierre. "He sees nothing beyond the pleasure \nof the moment, nothing troubles him and so \nhe is always cheerful, satisfied, and serene. \nWhat wouldn't I give to be like himl" he \nthought enviously. \n\nIn Mdrya Dmitrievna's anteroom the foot- \nman who helped him off with his fur coat said \nthat the mistress asked him to come to her bed- \nroom. \n\nWhen he opened the ballroom door Pierre \nsaw Natdsha sitting at the window, with a thin, \npale, and spiteful face. She glanced round at \nhim, frowned, and left the room with an ex- \npression of cold dignity. \n\n"What has happened?" asked Pierre, enter- \ning Marya Dmftrievna's room. \n\n"Fine doings {"answered Mdrya Drnitrievna. \n"For fifty-eight years have I lived in this world \nand never known anything so disgraceful!" \n\nAnd having put him on his honor not to \nrepeat anything she told him, Mdrya Drnitri- \nevna informed him that Natasha had refused \nPrince Andrew without her parents' knowl- \nedge and that the cause of this was Anatole \nKurdgin into whose society Pierre's wife had \nthrown her and with whom Natdsha had tried \nto elope during her father's absence, in order \nto be married secretly. \n\nPierre raised his shoulders and listened open- \nmouthed to what was told him, scarcely able to \nbelieve his own ears. That Prince Andrew's \ndeeply loved affianced wife the same Natdsha \nRost6va who used to be so charming should \ngive up Bolk6nski for that fool Anatole who \nwas already secretly married (as Pierre knew), \nand should be so in love with him as to agree \nto run away with him, was something Pierre \ncould not conceive and could not imagine. \n\nHe could not reconcile the charming impres- \nsion he had of Natdsha, whom he had known \nfrom a child, with this new conception of her \nbaseness, folly, and cruelty. He thought of his \nwife. "They are all alikel" he said to himself, \nreflecting that he was not the only man unfor- \ntunate enough to be tied to a bad woman. But \n\n\n\nstill he pitied Prince Andrew to the point of \ntears and sympathized with his wounded pride, \nand the more he pitied his friend the more did \nhe think with contempt and even with disgust \nof that Natdsha who had just passed him in \nthe ballroom with such a look of cold dignity. \nHe did not know that Natdsha's soul was over- \nflowing with despair, shame, and humiliation, \nand that it was not her fault that her face hap- \npened to assume an expression of calm dignity \nand severity. \n\n"But how get married?" said Pierre, in an- \nswer to Mdrya Dmftrievna. "He could not \nmarry he is married!" \n\n"Things get worse from hour to hour!" ejac- \nulated Mdrya Dmftrievna. "A niceyouth! What \na scoundrel! And she's expecting him expect- \ning him since yesterday. She must be told! Then \nat least she won't go on expecting him." \n\nAfter hearing the details of Anatole's mar- \nriage from Pierre, and giving vent to her anger \nagainst Anatole in words of abuse, Mdrya \nDrnitrievna told Pierre why she had sent for \nhim. She was afraid that the count or Bolk6n- \nski, who might arrive at any moment, if they \nknew of this affair (which she hoped to hide \nfrom them) might challenge Anatole to a duel, \nand she therefore asked Pierre to tell his broth- \ner-in-law in her name to leave Moscow and not \ndare to let her set eyes on him again. Pierre- \nonly now realizing the danger to the old count, \nNicholas, and Prince Andrew promised to do \nas she wished. Having briefly and exactly ex- \nplained her wishes to him, she let him go to \nthe drawing room. \n\n"Mind, the count knows nothing. Behave as \nif you know nothing either," she said. "And I \nwill go and tell her it is no use expecting him! \nAnd stay to dinner if you care to!" she called \nafter Pierre. \n\nPierre met the old count, who seemed nerv- \nous and upset. That morning Natdsha had told \nhim that she had rejected Bolk6nski. \n\n"Troubles, troubles, my dear fellow!" he \nsaid to Pierre. "What troubles one has with \nthese girls without their mother! I do so regret \n\nhaving come here I will be frank with you. \n\nHave you heard she has broken off her engage- \nment without consulting anybody? It's true \nthis engagement never was much to my liking. \nOf course he is an excellent man, but still, with \nhis father's disapproval they wouldn't have \nbeen happy, and Natdsha won't lack suitors. \nStill, it has been going on so long, and to take \nsuch a step without father's or mother's con- \nsent! And now she's ill, and God knows what! \n\n\n\n336 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nIt's hard, Count, hard to manage daughters in \ntheir mother's absence. . . ." \n\nPierre saw that the count was much upset \nand tried to change the subject, but the count \nreturned to his troubles. \n\nS6nya entered the room with an agitated \nface. \n\n"Natdsha is not quite well; she's in her room \nand would like to see you. Mdrya Dmftrievna \nis with her and she too asks you to come." \n\n"Yes, you are a great friend of Bolk6nski's, \nno doubt she wants to send him a message," \nsaid the count. "Oh dearl Oh dearl How happy \nit all was!" \n\nAnd clutching the spare gray locks on his \ntemples the count left the room. \n\nWhen Mdrya Dmftrievna told Natdsha that \nAnatole was married, Natdsha did not wish to \nbelieve it and insisted on having it confirmed \nby Pierre himself. S6nya told Pierre this as she \nled him along the corridor to Natasha's room. \n\nNatdsha, pale and stern, was sitting beside \nMdrya Dmftrievna, and her eyes, glittering fe- \nverishly, met Pierre with a questioning look \nthe moment he entered. She did not smile or \nnod, butonlygazed fixedly at him, and her look \nasked only one thing: was he a friend, or like \nthe others an enemy in regard to Anatole? As \nfor Pierre, he evidently did not exist for her. \n\n"He knows all about it," said Mdrya Dmitri- \nevna pointing to Pierre and addressing Natd- \nsha. "Let him tell you whether I have told the \n\n\n\n//Natdsha looked from one to the other as a \nhunted and wounded animal looks at the ap- \nproaching dogs and sportsmen. \n\n"Natdlya Ilynfchna," Pierre began, drop- \nping his eyes with a feeling of pity for her and \nloathing for the thing he had to do, "whether \nit is true or not should make no difference to \nyou, because ..." \n\n"Then it is not true that he's married 1" \n\n"Yes, it is true." \n\n"Has he been married long?" she asked. "On \nyour honor? . . ." \n\nPierre gave his word of honor. \n\n"Is he still here?" she asked, quickly. \n\n"Yes, I have just seen him." \n\nShe was evidently unable to speak and made a \nsign with her hands that they should leave her \nalone. \n\nCHAPTER XX \n\nPIERRE did not stay for dinner, but left the \nroom and went away at once. He drove through \nthe town seeking Anatole Kuragin, at the \n\n\n\nthought of whom now the blood rushed to his \nheart and he felt a difficulty in breathing. He \nwas not at the ice hills, nor at the gypsies', nor \nat Komoneno's. Pierre drove to the Club. In \nthe Club all was going on as usual. The mem- \nbers who were assembling for dinner were sit- \nting about in groups; they greeted Pierre and \nspoke of the town news. The footman having \ngreeted him, knowing his habits and his ac- \nquaintances, told him there was a place left \nfor him in the small dining room and that \nPrince Michael Zakhdrych was in the library, \nbut Paul Timofe*evich had not yet arrived. \nOne of Pierre's acquaintances, while they were \ntalking about the weather, asked if he had \nheard of Kuragin's abduction of Rostova which \nwas talked of in the town, and was it true? \nPierre laughed and said it was nonsense for he \nhad just come from the Rostovs'. He asked \neveryone about Anatole. One man told him he \nhad not come yet, and another that he was \ncoming to dinner. Pierre felt it strange to sec \nthis calm, indifferent crowd of people unaware \nof what was going on in his soul. He paced \nthrough the ballroom, waited till everyone had \ncome, and as Anatole had not turned up did \nnot stay for dinner but drove home. \n\nAnatole, for whom Pierre was looking, dined \nthat day with D61okhov, consulting him as to \nhow to remedy this unfortunate affair. It \nseemed to him essential to see Natdsha. In the \nevening he drove to his sister's to discuss with \nher how to arrange a meeting. When Pierre re- \nturned home after vainly hunting all over \nMoscow, his valet informed him that Prince \nAnatole was with the countess. The countess' \ndrawing room was full of guests. \n\nPierre without greeting his wife whom lie \nhad not seen since his return at that moment \nshe was more repulsive to him than everen- \ntered the drawing room and seeing Anatole \nwent up to him. \n\n"Ah, Pierre," said the countess going up to \nher husband. "You don't know what a plight \nour Anatole . . ." \n\nShe stopped, seeing in the forward thrust of \nher husband's head, in his glowing eyes and his \nresolute gait, the terrible indications of that \nrage and strength which she knew and had \nherself experienced after his duel with D61okh- \nov. \n\n"Where you are, there is vice and evill" said \nPierre to his wife. "Anatole, come with me! I \nmust speak to you," he added in French. \n\nAnatole glanced round at his sister and rose \nsubmissively, ready to follow Pierre. Pierre, \n\n\n\nBOOK EIGHT \n\n\n\n337 \n\n\n\ntaking him by the arm, pulled him to ward him- \nself and was leading him from the room. \n\n"If you allow yourself in my drawing room \n. . ." whispered Hel6ne, but Pierre did not re- \nply and went out of the room. \n\nAnatole followed him with his usual jaunty \nstep but his face betrayed anxiety. \n\nHaving entered his study Pierre closed the \ndoor and addressed Anatole without looking \nat him. \n\n"You promised Countess Rost6va to marry \nher and were about to elope with her, is that \nso?" \n\n"Mon cher" answered Anatole (their whole \nconversation was in French), "I don't consider \nmyself bound to answer questions put to me \nin that tone." \n\nPierre's face, already pale, became distorted \nby fury. He seized Anatole by the collar of his \nuniform with his big hand and shook him \nfrom side to side till Anatole's face showed a \nsufficient degree of terror. \n\n"When I tell you that I must talk to you! \n. . ." repeated Pierre. \n\n"Come now, this is stupid. What?" said Ana- \ntole, fingering a button of his collar that had \nbeen wrenched loose with a bit of the cloth. \n\n"You're a scoundrel and a blackguard, and \nI don't know what deprives me from the pleas- \nure of smashing your head with this!" said \nPierre, expressing himself so artificially because \nhe was talking French. \n\nHe took a heavy paperweight and lifted it \nthreateningly, but at once put it back in its \nplace. \n\n"Did you promise to marry her?" \n\n"I ... I ... I didn't think of it. I never prom- \nised, because ..." \n\nPierre interrupted him. \n\n"Have you any letters of hers? Any letters?" \nhe said, moving toward Anatole. \n\nAnatole glanced at him and immediately \nthrust his hand into his pocket and drew out \nhis pocketbook. \n\nPierre took the letter Anatole handed him \nand, pushing aside a table that stood in his \nway, threw himself on the sofa. \n\n"1 shan't be violent, don't be afraid!" said \nPierre in answer to a frightened gesture of \nAnatole's. "First, the letters," said he, as if re- \npeating a lesson to himself. "Secondly," he con- \ntinued after a short pause, again rising and \nagain pacing the room, "tomorrow you must \nget out of Moscow." \n\n"But how can I? . . ." \n\n"Thirdly/' Pierre continued without listen- \n\n\n\ning to him, "you must never breathe a word \nof what has passed between you and Countess \nRost6va. I know I can't prevent your doing so, \nbut if you have a spark of conscience . . ." \nPierre paced the room several times in silence. \nAnatole sat at a table frowning and biting \nhis lips. \n\n"After all, you must understand that besides \nyour pleasure there is such a thing as other \npeople's happiness and peace, and that you are \nruining a whole life for the sake of amusing \nyourself! Amuse yourself with women like my \nwife with them you are within your rights, \nfor they know what you want of them. They \nare armed against you by the same experience \nof debauchery; but to promise a maid to marry \nher ... to deceive, to kidnap. . . . Don't you \nunderstand that it is as mean as beating an \nold man or a child? . . ." \n\nPierre paused and looked at Anatole no \nlonger with an angry but with a questioning \nlook. \n\n"I don't know about that, eh?" said Anatole, \ngrowing more confident as Pierre mastered his \nwrath. "I don't know that and don't want to," \nhe said, not looking at Pierre and with a slight \ntremor of his lower jaw, "but you have used \nsuch words to me 'mean* and so on which as \na man of honor I can't allow anyone to use." \n\nPierre glanced at him with amazement, un- \nable to understand what he wanted. \n\n"Though it was tete-a-tete," Anatole con- \ntinued, "still I can't . . ." \n\n"Is it satisfaction you want?" said Pierre \nironically. \n\n"You could at least take back your words. \nWhat? If you want me to do as you wish, eh?" \n\n"I take them back, I take them back!" said \nPierre, "and I ask you to forgive me." Pierre \ninvolun tarily glanc eel at the loose button. "And \nif you require money lor your journey . . ." \n\nAnatole smiled. The expression of that base \nand cringing smile, which Pierre knew so well \nin his wife, revolted him. \n\n"Oh, vile and heartless brood! "he exclaimed, \nand left the room. \n\nNext day Anatole left for Petersburg. \n\nCHAPTER XXI \n\nPIERRE drove to Marya Dmitrievna's to tell her \nof the fulfillment of her wish that Kurdgin \nshould be banished from Moscow. The whole \nhouse was in a state of alarm and commotion. \nNatdsha was very ill, having, as Mdrya Dmitri- \nevna told him in secret, poisoned herself the \nnight after she had been told that Anatole was \n\n\n\n338 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nmarried, with some arsenic she had stealthily \nprocured. After swallowing a little she had \nbeen so frightened that she woke S6nya and \ntold her what she had done. The necessary \nantidotes had been administered in time and \nshe was now out of danger, though still so \nweak that it was out of the question to move \nher to the country, and so the countess had \nbeen sent for. Pierre saw the distracted count, \nand S6nya, who had a tear-stained face, but he \ncould not see Natasha. \n\nPierre dined at the club that day and heard \non all sides gossip about the attempted abduc- \ntion of Rost6va. He resolutely denied these \nrumors, assuring everyone that nothing had \nhappened except that his brother-in-law had \nproposed to her and been refused. It seemed to \nPierre that it was his duty to conceal the whole \naffair and re-establish Natdsha's reputation. \n\nHe was awaiting Prince Andrew's return \nwith dread and went every day to the old \nprince's for news of him. \n\nOld Prince Bolk6nski heard all the rumors \ncurrent in the town from Mademoiselle Bouri- \nenne and had read the note to Princess Mary \nin which Natdsha had broken off her engage- \nment. He seemed in better spirits than usual \nand awaited his son with great impatience. \n\nSome days after Anatole's departure Pierre \nreceived a note from Prince Andrew, inform- \ning him of his arrival and asking him to come \nto see him. \n\nAs soon as he reached Moscow, Prince An- \ndrew had received from his father Natdsha's \nnote to Princess Mary breaking off her engage- \nment (Mademoiselle Bourienne had purloined \nit from Princess Mary and given it to the old \nprince), and he heard from him the story of \nNatdsha's elopement, with additions. \n\nPrince Andrew had arrived in the evening \nand Pierre came to see him next morning. \nPierre expected to find Prince Andrew in al- \nmost the same state as Natdsha and was there- \nfore surprised on entering the drawing room \nto hear him in the study talking in a loud ani- \nmated voice about some intrigue going on in \nPetersburg. The old prince's voice and anoth- \ner now and then interrupted him. Princess \nMary came out to meet Pierre. She sighed, \nlooking toward the door of the room where \nPrince Andrew was, evidently intending to ex- \npress her sympathy with his sorrow, but Pierre \nsaw by her face that she was glad both at what \nhad happened and at the way her brother had \ntaken the news of Natasha's faithlessness. \n\n"He says he expected it," she remarked. "I \n\n\n\nknow his pride will not let him express his \nfeelings, but still he has taken it better, far \nbetter, than I expected. Evidently it had to \nbe. . . ." \n\n"But is it possible that all is really ended?" \nasked Pierre. \n\nPrincess Mary looked at him with astonish- \nment. She did not understand how he could \nask such a question. Pierre went into the study. \nPrince Andrew, greatly changed and plainly \nin better health, but with a fresh horizontal \nwrinkle between his brows, stood in civilian \ndress facing his father and Prince Meshchrski, \nwarmly disputing and vigorously gesticulating. \nThe conversation was a^out Sperdnski the \nnews of whose sudden exile and alleged treach- \nery had just reached Moscow. \n\n"Now he is censured and accused by all who \nwere enthusiastic about him a month ago," \nPrince Andrew was saying, "and by those who \nwere unable to understand his aims. To judge \na man who is in disfavor and to throw on him \nall the blame of other men's mistakes is very \neasy, but I maintain that if anything good has \nbeen accomplished in this reign it was done by \nhim, by him alone." \n\nHe paused at the sight of Pierre. His face \nquivered and immediately assumed a vindictive \nexpression. \n\n"Posterity will do him justice," he concluded, \nand at once turned to Pierre. \n\n"Well, how are you? Still getting stouter?" \nhe said with animation, but the new wrinkle \non his forehead deepened. "Yes, I am well," he \nsaid in answer to Pierre's question, and smiled. \n\nTo Pierre that smile said plainly: "I am well, \nbut my health is now of no use to anyone." \n\nAfter a few words to Pierre about the awful \nroads from the Polish frontier, about people \nhe had met in Switzerland who knew Pierre, \nand about M. Dessalles, whom he had brought \nfrom abroad to be his son's tutor, Prince An- \ndrew again joined warmly in the conversation \nabout Sperdnski which was still going on be- \ntween the two old men. \n\n"If there were treason, or proofs of secret re- \nlations with Napoleon, they would have been \nmade public," he said with warmth and haste. \n"I do not, and never did, like Sperdnski per- \nsonally, but I like justice!" \n\nPierre now recognized in his friend a need \nwith which he was only too familiar, to get ex- \ncited and to have arguments about extraneous \nmatters in order to stifle thoughts that were \ntoo oppressive and too intimate. \n\nWhen Prince Meshch^rski had left, Prince \n\n\n\nAndrew took Pierre's arm and asked him into \nthe room that had been assigned him. A bed \nhad been made up there, and some open port- \nmanteaus and trunks stood about. Prince An- \ndrew went to one and took out a small casket, \nfrom which he drew a packet wrapped in pa- \nper. He did it all silently and very quickly. He \nstood up and coughed. His face was gloomy \nand his lips compressed. \n\n"Forgive me for troubling you. . . ." \n\nPierre saw that Prince Andrew was going to \nspeak of Natasha, and his broad face expressed \npity and sympathy. This expression irritated \nPrince Andrew, and in a determined, ringing, \nand unpleasant tone he continued: \n\n"I have received a refusal from Countess \nRost6va and have heard reports of your broth- \ner-in-law having sought her hand, or something \nof that kind. Is that true?" \n\n"Both true and untrue," Pierre began; but \nPrince Andrew interrupted him. \n\n"Here are her letters and her portrait," said \nhe. \n\nHe took the packet from the table and \nhanded it to Pierre. \n\n"Give this to the countess ... if you see her." \n\n"She is very ill," said Pierre. \n\n"Then she is here still?" said Prince Andrew. \n"And Prince Kuragin?" he added quickly. \n\n"He left long ago. She has been at death's \ndoor." \n\n"I much regret her illness," said Prince An- \ndrew; and he smiled like his father, coldly, \nmaliciously, and unpleasantly. \n\n"So Monsieur Kuragin has not honored \nCountess Rost6va with his hand?" said Prince \nAndrew, and he snorted several times. \n\n"He could not marry, for he was married al- \nready," said Pierre. \n\nPrince Andrew laughed disagreeably, again \nreminding one of his father. \n\n"And where is your brother-in-law now, if I \nmay ask?" he said. \n\n"He has gone to Peters . . . But I don't know," \nsaid Pierre. \n\n"Well, it doesn't matter," said Prince An- \ndrew. "Tell Countess Rost6va that she was \nand is perfectly free and that I wish her all \nthat is good." \n\nPierre took the packet. Prince Andrew, as if \ntrying to remember whether he had something \nmore to say, or waiting to see if Pierre would \nsay anything, looked fixedly at him. \n\n"I say, do you remember our discussion in \nPetersburg?" asked Pierre, "about ..." \n\n"Yes," returned Prince Andrew hastily. "I \n\n\n\nBOOK EIGHT 359 \n\nsaid that a fallen woman should be forgiven, \n\n\n\nbut I didn't say I could forgive her. I can't." \n\n"But can this be compared . . .?" said Pierre. \n\nPrince Andrew interrupted him and cried \nsharply: "Yes, ask her hand again, be magnani- \nmous, and so on? . . . Yes, that would be very \nnoble, but I am unable to follow in that gen- \ntleman's footsteps. If you wish to be my friend \nnever speak to me of that ... of all that! Well, \ngood-by. So you'll give her the packet?" \n\nPierre left the room and went to the old \nprince and Princess Mary. \n\nThe old man seemed livelier than usual. \nPrincess Mary was the same as always, but be- \nneath her sympathy for her brother, Pierre \nnoticed her satisfaction that the engagement \nhad been broken off. Looking at them Pierre \nrealized what contempt and animosity they all \nfelt for the Rost6vs, and that it was impossible \nin their presence even to mention the name of \nher who could give up Prince Andrew for any- \none else. \n\nAt dinner the talk turned on the war, the \napproach of which was becoming evident. \nPrince Andrew talked incessantly, arguing now \nwith his father, now with the Swiss tutor Des- \nsalles, and showing an unnatural animation, \nthe cause of which Pierre so well understood. \n\nCHAPTER XXII \n\nTHAT SAME EVENING Pierre went to the Ros- \nt6vs' to fulfill the commission entrusted to \nhim. Natdsha was in bed, the count at the Club, \nand Pierre, after giving the letters to S6nya, \nwent to Mdrya Dmitrievna who was interested \nto know how Prince Andrew had taken the \nnews. Ten minutes later S6nya came to Mirya \nDmitrievna. \n\n"Natdsha insists on seeing Count Peter Kirf- \nlovich," said she. \n\n"But how? Are we to take him up to her? \nThe room there has not been tidied up." \n\n"No, she has dressed and gone into the draw- \ning room," said S6nya. \n\nMdrya Dmitrievna only shrugged her shoul- \nders. \n\n"When will her mother come? She has wor- \nried me to death! Now mind, don't tell her \neverything!" said she to Pierre. "One hasn't \nthe heart to scold her, she is so much to be \npitied, so much to be pitied." \n\nNatasha was standing in the middle of the \ndrawing room, emaciated, with a pale set face, \nbut not at all shamefaced as Pierre expected \nto find her. When he appeared at the door she \ngrew flurried, evidently undecided whether to \n\n\n\n340 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\ngo to meet him or to wait till he came up. \n\nPierre hastened to her. He thought she \nwould give him her hand as usual; but she, \nstepping up to him, stopped, breathing heavily, \nher arms hanging lifelessly just in the pose she \nused to stand in when she went to the middle \nof the ballroom to sing, but with quite a dif- \nferent expression of face. \n\n"Peter Kirf lovich," she began rapidly, "Prince \nBolk6nski was your friend is your friend," \nshe corrected herself. (It seemed to her that \neverything that had once been must now \nbe different.) "He told me once to apply to \nyou . . ." \n\nPierre sniffed as he looked at her, but did \nnot speak. Till then he had reproached herein \nhis heart and tried to despise her, but he now \nfelt so sorry for her that there was no room in \nhis soul for reproach. \n\n"He is here now: tell him ... to for ... for- \ngive me!" \n\nShe stopped and breathed still more quick- \nly, but did not shed tears. \n\n"Yes ... I will tell him," answered Pierre; \n"but . . ." \n\nHe did not know what to say. \n\nNatdsha was evidently dismayed at the \nthoughtof what he might think she had meant. \n\n"No, I know all is over," she said hurriedly. \n"No, that can never be. I'm only tormented by \nthe wrong I have done him. Tell him only that \nI beg him to forgive, forgive, forgive me for \neverything " \n\nShe trembled all over and sat down on a \nchair. \n\nA sense of pity he had never before known \noverflowed Pierre's heart. \n\n"I will tell him, I will tell him everything \nonce more," said Pierre. "But ... I should like \nto know one thing. . . ." \n\n"Know what?" Natdsha's eyes asked. \n\n"I should like to know, did you love . . ." \nPierre did not know how to refer to Anatole \nand flushed at the thought of him "did you \nlove that bad man?" \n\n"Don't call him bad!" said Natasha. "But I \ndon't know, don't know at all. . . ." \n\nShe began to cry arid a still greater sense of \npity, tenderness, and love welled up in Pierre. \nHe felt the tears trickle under his spectacles \nand hoped they would not be noticed. \n\n"We won't speak of it any more, my dear," \nsaid Pierre, and his gentle, cordial tone sud- \ndenly seemed very strange to Natdsha. . \n\n"We won't speak of it, my dear I'll tell him \neverything; but one thing 1 beg of you, con- \n\n\n\nsider me your friend and if you want help, ad- \nvice, or simply to open your heart to someone \nnot now, but when your mind is clearer \nthink of me!" He took her hand and kissed it, \n"I shall be happy if it's in my power . . ." \n\nPierre grew confused. \n\n"Don't speak to me like that. I am not worth \nit!" exclaimed Natdsha and turned to leave the \nroom, but Pierre held her hand. \n\nHe knew he had something more to say to \nher. But when he said it he was amazed at his \nown words. \n\n"Stop, stop! You have your whole life be- \nfore you," said he to her. \n\n"Before me? No! All is over for me," she re- \nplied with shame and self-abasement. \n\n"All over?" he repeated. "If I were not my- \nself, but the handsomest, cleverest, and best \nman in the world, and were free, I would this \nmoment ask on my knees for your hand and \nyour love!" \n\nFor the first time for many days Natdsha \nwept tears of gratitude and tenderness, and \nglancing at Pierre she went out of the room. \n\nPierre too when she had gone almost ran in- \nto the anteroom, restraining tears of tender- \nness and joy that choked him, and without \nfinding the sleeves of his fur cloak threw it on \nand got into his sleigh. \n\n"Where to now, your excellency?" asked the \ncoachman. \n\n"Where to?" Pierre asked himself. "Where \ncan I go now? Surely not to the Club or to pay \ncalls?" All men seemed so pitiful, so poor, in \ncomparison with this feeling of tenderness and \nlove he experienced: in comparison with that \nsoftened, grateful, last look she had given him \nthrough her tears. \n\n"Home!" said Pierre, and despite twenty- \ntwo degrees of frost Fahrenheit he threw open \nthe bearskin cloak from his broad chest and \ninhaled the air with joy. \n\nIt was clear and frosty. Above the dirty, ill- \nlit streets, above the black roofs, stretched the \ndark starry sky. Only looking up at the sky did \nPierre cease to feel how sordid and humiliating \nwere all mundane things compared with the \nheights to which his soul had just been raised. \nAt the entrance to the Arbdt Square an im- \nmense expanse of dark starry sky presented it- \nself to his eyes. Almost in the center of it, a- \nbove the Prechfstenka Boulevard, surrounded \nand sprinkled on all sides by stars but distin- \nguished from them all by its nearness to the \nearth, its white light, and its long uplifted tail, \nshone the enormous and brilliant comet of \n\n\n\nBOOK EIGHT 341 \n\n1812 the comet which was said to portend all ly like an arrow piercing the earthto remain \nkinds of woes and the end of the world. In fixed in a chosen spot, vigorously holding its \nPierre, however, that comet with its long lumi- tail erect, shining and displaying its white \nnous tail aroused no feeling of fear. On the lightamidcountlessotherscintillatingstars.lt \ncontrary he gazed joyfully, his eyes moist with seemed to Pierre that this comet fully re- \ntears, at this bright comet which, having trav- sponded to what was passing in his own sof- \ncled in its orbit with inconceivable velocity tened and uplifted soul, now blossoming into \nthrough immeasurable space, seemed sudden- a new life. \n\n\n\nBook Nine: 1812 \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I \n\nFROM THE CLOSE of the year 1811 an intensified \narming and concentrating of the forces of \nWestern Europe began, and in 1812 these \nforces millions of men, reckoning those trans- \nporting and feeding the army moved^from \nthe west eastwards to the Russian frontier, to- \nward which since 1811 Russian forces had been \nsimilarly drawn. On the twelfth of June, 1812, \nthe forces of Western Europe crossed the Rus- \nsian frontier and war began, that is, an event \ntook place opposed to human reason and to \nhuman nature. Millions of men perpetrated \nagainst one another such innumerable crimes, \nfrauds, treacheries, thefts, forgeries, issues of \nfalse money, burglaries, incendiarisms, and \nmurders as in whole centuries are not recorded \nin the annals of all the law courts of the world, \nbut which those who committed them did not \nat the time regard as being crimes. \n\nWhat produced this extraordinary occur- \nrence? What were its causes? The historians \ntell us with nai've assurance that its causes were \nthe wrongs inflicted on the Duke of Olden- \nburg, the nonobservance of the Continental \nSystem, the ambition of Napoleon, the firm- \nness of Alexander, the mistakes of the diplo- \nmatists, and so on. \n\nConsequently, it would only have been nec- \nessary for Metternich, Rumyanstev, or Talley- \nrand, between a levee and an evening party, to \nhave taken proper pains and written a more \nadroit note, or for Napoleon to have written \nto Alexander: "My respected Brother, I con- \nsent to restore the duchy to the Duke of Old- \nenburg" and there would have been no war. \n\nWe can understand that the matter seemed \nlike that to contemporaries. It naturally seemed \nto Napoleon that the war was caused by Eng- \nland's intrigues (as in fact he said on the island \nof St. Helena). It naturally seemed to members \nof the English Parliament that the cause of the \nwar was Napoleon's ambition; to the Duke of \nOldenburg, that the cause of the war was the \nviolence done to him; to businessmen that \n\n\n\nthe cause of the war was the Continental Sys- \ntem which was ruining Europe; to the generals \nand old soldiers that the chief reason for the \nwar was the necessity of giving them employ- \nment; to the legitimists of that day that it was \nthe need of re-establishing les bons principes, \nand to the diplomatists of that time that it all \nresulted from the fact that the alliance be- \ntween Russia and Austria in 1809 had not been \nsufficiently well concealed from Napoleon, and \nfrom the awkward wording of Memorandum \nNo. 178. It is natural that these and a count- \nless and infinite quantity of other reasons, the \nnumber depending on the endless diversity of \npoints of view, presented themselves to the \nmen of that day; but to us, to posterity who \nview the thing that happened in all its magni- \ntude and perceive its plain and terrible mean- \ning, these causes seem insufficient. To us it is \nincomprehensible that millions of Christian \nmen killed and tortured each other either be- \ncause Napoleon was ambitious or Alexander \nwas firm, or because England's policy was astute \nor the Duke of Oldenburg wronged. We can- \nnot grasp what connection such circumstances \nhave with the actual fact of slaughter and vio- \nlence: why because the Duke was wronged, \nthousands of men from the other side of Eu- \nrope killed and ruined the people of Smolensk \nand Moscow and were killed by them. \n\nTo us, their descendants, who are not his- \ntorians and are not carried away by the process \nof research and can therefore regard the event \nwith unclouded common sense, an incalculable \nnumber of causes present themselves. The \ndeeper we delve in search of these causes the \nmore of them we find; and each separate cause \nor whole series of causes appears to us equally \nvalid in itself and equally false by its insignif- \nicance compared to the magnitude of the \nevents, and by its impotence apart from the \ncooperation of all the other coincident causes \nto occasion the event. To us, the wish or ob- \njection of this or that French corporal to serve \na second term appears as much a cause as Na- \n\n\n\n34* \n\n\n\nBOOK NINE \n\n\n\n343 \n\n\n\npoleon's refusal to withdraw his troops beyond \nthe Vistula and to restore the duchy of Olden- \nburg; for had he not wished to serve, and had \na second, a third, and a thousandth corporal \nand private also refused, there would have \nbeen so many less men in Napoleon's army \nand the war could not have occurred. \n\nHad Napoleon not taken offense at the de- \nmand that he should withdraw beyond the \nVistula, and not ordered his troops to advance, \nthere would have been no war; but had all his \nsergeants objected to serving a second term \nthen also there could have been no war. Nor \ncould there have been a war had there been \nno English intrigues and no Duke of Olden- \nburg, and had Alexander not felt insulted, and \nhad there not been an autocratic government \nin Russia, or a Revolution in France and a \nsubsequent dictatorship and Empire, or all the \nthings that produced the French Revolution, \nand so on. Without each of these causes noth- \ning could have happened. So all these causes- \nmyriads of causes coincided to bring it about. \nAnd so there was no one cause for that occur- \nrence, but it had to occur because it had to. \nMillions of men, renouncing their human feel- \nings and reason, had to go from west to east to \nslay their fellows, just as some centuries previ- \nously hordes of men had come from the east to \nthe west, slaying their fellows. \n\nThe actions ot Napoleon and Alexander, on \nwhose words the event seemed to hang, were \nas little voluntary as the actions of any soldier \nwho was drawn into the campaign by lot or by \nconscription. This could not be otherwise, for \nin order that the will of Napoleon and Alex- \nander (on whom the event seemed to depend) \nshould be carried out, the concurrence of in- \nnumerable circumstances was needed without \nany one of which the event could not have tak- \nen place. It was necessary that millions of men \nin whose hands lay the real power the soldiers \nwho fired, or transported provisions and guns \nshould consent to carry out the will of these \nweak individuals, and should have been in- \nduced to do so by an infinite numberof diverse \nand complex causes. \n\nWe are forced to fall back on fatalism as an \nexplanation of irrational events (that is to say, \nevents the reasonableness of which we do not \nunderstand). The more we try to explain such \nevents in history reasonably, the more unrea- \nsonable and incomprehensible do they become \nto us. \n\nEach man lives for himself, using his free- \ndom to attain his personal aims, and feels with \n\n\n\nhis whole being that he can now do or abstain \nfrom doing this or that action; but as soon as \nhe has done it, that action performed at a cer- \ntain moment in time becomes irrevocable and \nbelongs to history, in which it has not a free \nbut a predestined significance. \n\nThere are two sides to the life of every man, \nhis individual life, which is the more free the \nmore abstract its interests, and his elemental \nhive life in which he inevitably obeys laws laid \ndown for him. \n\nMan lives consciously for himself, but is an \nunconscious instrument in the attainment of \nthe historic, universal, aims of humanity. A \ndeed done is irrevocable, and its result coin- \nciding in time with the actions of millions of \nother men assumes anhistoricsignificance.The \nhigher a man stands on the social ladder, the \nmore people he is connected with and the \nmore power he has over others, the more evi- \ndent is the predestination and inevitability of \nhis every action. \n\n"The king's heart is in the hands of the \nLord." \n\nA king is history's slave. \n\nHistory, that is, the unconscious, general, \nhive life of mankind, uses every moment of \nthe life of kings as a tool for its own purposes. \n\nThough Napoleon at that time, in 1812, was \nmore convinced than ever that it depended on \nhim, verser (on ne pas verser) le sang de ses \npeuples l as Alexander expressed it in the last \nletter he wrote him he had never been so \nmuch in the grip of inevitable laws, which com- \npelled him, while thinking that he was acting \non his own volition, to perform for the hive \nlife that is to say, for history whatever had \nto be performed. \n\nThe people of the west moved eastwards to \nslay their fellow men, and by the law of coin- \ncidence thousands of minute causes fitted in \nand co-ordinated to produce that movement \nand war: reproaches for the nonobservance of \nthe Continental System, the Duke of Olden- \nburg's wrongs, the movement of troops into \nPrussia undertaken (as it seemed to Napo- \nleon) only for the purpose of securing an \narmed peace, the French Emperor's love and \nhabit of war coinciding with his people's in- \nclinations, allurement by the grandeur of the \npreparations, and the expenditure on those \npreparations and the need of obtaining ad- \nvantages to compensate for that expenditure, \nthe intoxicating honors he received in Dres- \n\n1 "To shed (or not to shed) the blood of his peo- \nples." \n\n\n\n344 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nden, the diplomatic negotiations which, in the \nopinion of contemporaries, were carried on \nwith a sincere desire to attain peace, but which \nonly wounded the self-love of both sides, and \nmillions and millions of other causes that \nadapted themselves to the event that was \nhappening or coincided with it. \n\nWhen an apple has ripened and falls, why \ndoes it fall? Because of its attraction to the \nearth, because its stalk withers, because it is \ndried by the sun, because it grows heavier, be- \ncause the wind shakes it, or because the boy \nstanding below wants to eat it? \n\nNothing is the cause. All this is only the co- \nincidence of conditions in which all vital or- \nganic and elemental events occur. And the \nbotanist who finds that the apple falls because \nthe cellular tissue decays and so forth is equal- \nly right with the child who stands under the \ntree and says the apple fell because he wanted \nto eat it and prayed for it. Equally right or \nwrong is he who says that Napoleon went to \nMoscow because he wanted to, and perished \nbecause Alexander desired his destruction, and \nhe who says that an undermined hill weighing \na million tons fell because the last navvy struck \nit for the last time with his mattock. In historic \nevents, the so-called great men are labels giv- \ning names to events, and like labels they have \nbut the smallest connection with the event it- \nself. \n\nEvery act of theirs, which appears to them \nan act of their own will, is in an historical \nsense involuntary and is related to the whole \ncourse of history and predestined from eternity. \n\nCHAPTER II \n\nON THE TWENTY-NINTH OF MAY Napoleon left \n\nDresden, 1 where he had spent three weeks sur- \nrounded by a court that included princes, \ndukes, kings, and even an emperor. Before \nleaving, Napoleon showed favor to the em- \nperor, kings, and princes who had deserved it, \nreprimanded the kings and princes with whom \nhe was dissatisfied, presented pearls and dia- \nmonds of his ownthat is, which he had taken \nfrom other kings to the Empress of Austria, \nand having, as his historian tells us, tenderly \nembraced the Empress Marie Louisewho re- \ngarded him as her husband, though he had left \nanother wife in Paris left her grieved by the \nparting which she seemed hardly able to bear. \nThough the diplomatists still firmly believed \nin the possibility of peace and worked zealous- \n\n1 According to the Gregorian or "New Style" cal- \nendar. TR. \n\n\n\nly to that end, and though the Emperor Napo- \nleon himself wrote a letter to Alexander, call- \ning him Monsieur mon frere, and sincerely as- \nsured him that he did not want war and would \nalways love and honor him yet he set off to \njoin his army, and at every station gave fresh \norders to accelerate the movement of his troops \nfrom west to east. He went in a traveling coach \nwith six horses, surrounded by pages, aides-de- \ncamp, and an escort, along the road to Posen, \nThorn, Danzig, and Konigsberg. At each of \nthese towns thousands of people met him with \nexcitement and enthusiasm. \n\nThe army was moving from west to east, and \nrelays of six horses carried him in the same \ndirection. On the tenth of June, 2 coming up \nwith the army, he spent the night in apart- \nments prepared for him on the estate of a \nPolish count in the Vilkavisski forest. \n\nNext day, overtaking the army, he went in \na carriage to the Niemen, and, changing into \na Polish uniform, he drove to the riverbank in \norder to select a place for the crossing. \n\nSeeing, on the other side, some Cossacks (Ics \nCosaques) and the wide-spreading steppes in \nthe midst of which lay the holy city of Moscow \n(Moscou, la ville sainte), the capital of a realm \nsuch as the Scythia into which Alexander the \nGreat had marched Napoleon unexpectedly, \nand contrary alike to strategic and diplomatic \nconsiderations, ordered an advance, and the \nnext day his army began to cross the Niemen. \n\nEarly in the morning of the twelfth of June \nhe came out of his tent, which was pitched that \nday on the steep left bank of the Niemen, and \nlooked through a spyglass at the streams of his \ntroops pouring out of the Vilkavisski forest \nand flowing over the three bridges thrown \nacross the river. The troops, knowing of the \nEmperor's presence, were on the lookout for \nhim, and when they caught sight of a figure in \nan overcoat arid a cocked hat standing apart \nfrom his suite in front of his tent on the hill, \nthey threw up their caps and shouted: "Vive \nVEmpereur!" and one after another poured in \na ceaseless stream out of the vast forest that \nhad concealed them and, separating, flowed on \nand on by the three bridges to the other side. \n\n"Now we'll go into action. Oh, when he \ntakes it in hand himself, things get hot ... by \nheaven! . . . There he is! ... Vive VEmpereur! \nSo these are the steppes of Asia! It's a nasty \ncountry all the same. Au revoir, Beauchd; I'll \nkeep the best palace in Moscow for you! Au \nrevoir. Good luck! . . . Did you see the Emper- \n\na Old style. \n\n\n\nBOOK \n\nor? Vive I'Empereur! . . . preur!\l they make \nme Governor of India, Gerard, I'll make you \nMinister of Kashmir that's settled. Vive I'Em- \npereur! Hurrah I hurrah! hurrah! The Cos- \nsacksthose rascals see how they run! Vive \nI'Empereur! There he is, do you see him? I've \nseen him twice, as I see you now. The little \ncorporal ... I saw him give the cross to one of \nthe veterans. . . . Vive I'Empereur!" came the \nvoices of men, old and young, of most diverse \ncharacters and social positions. On the faces \nof all was one common expression of joy at the \ncommencement of the long-expected campaign \nand of rapture and devotion to the man in the \ngray coat who was standing on the hill. \n\nOn the thirteenth of June a rather small, \nthoroughbred Arab horse was brought to Na- \npoleon. He mounted it and rode at a gallop to \none of the bridges over the Niemcn, deafened \ncontinually by incessant and rapturous accla- \nmations which he evidently endured only be- \ncause it was impossible to forbid the soldiers to \nexpress their love of him by such shouting, but \nthe shouting which accompanied him every- \nwhere disturbed him and distracted him from \nthe military cares that had occupied him from \nthe time he joined the army. He rode across \none of the swaying pontoon bridges to the far- \nther side, turned sharply to the left, and gal- \nloped in the direction of K6vno, preceded by \nenraptured, mounted chasseurs of the Guard \nwho, breathless with delight, galloped ahead \nto clear a path for him through the troops. On \nreaching the broad river Viliya, he stopped \nnear a regiment of Polish Uhlans stationed by \nthe river. \n\n"Vivat!" shouted the Poles, ecstatically, \nbreaking their ranks and pressing against one \nanother to see him. \n\nNapoleon looked up and down the river, \ndismounted, and sat down on a log that lay on \nthe bank. At a mute sign from him, a telescope \nwas handed him which he rested on the back \nof a happy page who had run up to him, and \nhe gazed at the opposite bank. Then he be- \ncame absorbed in a map laid out on the logs. \nWithout lifting his head he said something, \nand two of his aides-de-camp galloped off to \nthe Polish Uhlans. \n\n"What? What did he say?" was heard in the \nranks of the Polish Uhlans when one of the \naides-de-camp rode up to them. \n\nThe order was to find a ford and to cross the \nriver. The colonel of the Polish Uhlans, a' \nhandsome old man, flushed and, fumbling in \nhis speech from excitement, asked the aide-de- \n\n\n\nNINE 345 \n\ncamp whether he would be permitted to swim \nthe river with his Uhlans instead of seeking a \nford. In evident fear of refusal, like a boy asking \nfor permission to get on a horse, he begged to \nbe allowed to swim across the river before the \nEmperor's eyes. The aide-de-camp replied that \nprobably the Emperor would not be displeased \nat this excess of zeal. \n\nAs soon as the aide-de-camp had said this, \nthe old mustached officer, with happy face and \nsparkling eyes, raised his saber, shouted "Fi- \nvat!" and, commanding the Uhlans to follow \nhim, spurred his horse and galloped into the \nriver. He gave an angry thrust to his horse, \nwhich had grown restive under him, and \nplunged into the water, heading for the deep- \nest part where the current was swift. Hun- \ndreds of Uhlans galloped in after him. It was \ncold and uncanny in the rapid current in the \nmiddle of the stream, and the Uhlans caught \nhold of one another as they fell off their horses. \nSome of the horses were drowned and some of \nthe men; the others tried to swim on, some in \nthe saddle and some clinging to their horses' \nmanes. They tried to make their way forward \nto the opposite bank and, though there was a \nford one third of a mile away, were proud that \nthey were swimming and drowning in this riv- \ner under the eyes of the man who sat on the \nlog and was not even looking at what they \nwere doing. When the aide-de-camp, having re- \nturned and choosing an opportune moment, \nventured to draw the Emperor's attention to \nthe devotion of the Poles to his person, the lit- \ntle man in the gray overcoat got up and, hav- \ning summoned Berthier, began pacing up and \ndown the bank with him, giving him instruc- \ntions and occasionally glancing disapproving- \nly at the drowning Uhlans who distracted his \nattention. \n\nFor him it was no new conviction that his \npresence in any part of the world, from Africa \nto the steppes of Muscovy alike, was enough to \ndumfound people and impel them to insane \nself-oblivion. He called for his horse and rode \nto his quarters. \n\nSome forty Uhlans were drowned in the riv- \ner, though boats were sent to their assistance. \nThe majority struggled back to the bank from \nwhich they had started. The colonel and some \nof his men got across and with difficulty clam- \nbered out on the further bank. And as soon as \nthey had got out, in their soaked and stream- \ning clothes, they shouted "Vivat!'' and looked \necstatically at the spot where Napoleon had \nbeen but where he no longer was and at that \n\n\n\n346 \n\nmoment considered themselves happy. \n\nThat evening, between issuing one order \nthat the forged Russian paper money prepared \nfor use in Russia should be delivered as quick- \nly as possible and another that a Saxon should \nbe shot, on whom a letter containing informa- \ntion about the orders to the French army had \nbeen found, Napoleon also gave instructions \nthat the Polish colonel who had needlessly \nplunged into the river should be enrolled in \nthe Legion d'honneur of which Napoleon was \nhimself the head. \n\nQuos vult perdere demcntat* \n\nCHAPTER III \n\nTHE EMPEROR OF RUSSIA had, meanwhile, been \nin Vilna for more than a month, reviewing \ntroops and holding maneuvers. Nothing was \nready for the war that everyone expected and \nto prepare for which the Emperor had come \nfrom Petersburg. There was no general plan \nof action. The vacillation between the various \nplans that were proposed had even increased \nafter the Emperor had been at headquarters \nfor a month. Each of the three armies had its \nown commander in chief, but there was no \nsupreme commander of all the forces, and the \nEmperor did not assume that responsibility \nhimself. \n\nThe longer the Emperor remained in Vilna \nthe less did everybodytired of waiting pre- \npare for the war. All the efforts of those who \nsurrounded the sovereign seemed directed \nmerely to making him spend his time pleasant- \nly and forget that war was impending. \n\nIn June, after many balls and fetes given by \nthe Polish magnates, by the courtiers, and by \nthe Emperor himself, it occurred to one of the \nPolish aides-de-camp in attendance that a din- \nner and ball should be given for the Emperor \nby his aides-de-camp. This idea was eagerly re- \nceived. The Emperor gave his consent. The \naides-de-camp collected money by subscription. \nThe lady who was thought to be most pleasing \nto the Emperor was invited to act as hostess. \nCount Bennigsen, being a landowner in the \nVilna province, offered his country house for \nthe fete, and the thirteenth of June was fixed \nfor a ball, dinner, regatta, and fireworks at \nZakret, Count Bennigsen's country seat. \n\nThe very day that Napoleon issued the or- \nder to cross the Niemen, and his vanguard, \ndriving off the Cossacks, crossed the Russian \nfrontier, Alexander spent the evening at the \n\n1 Those whom (God) wishes to destroy he drives \nmad. \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\nentertainment given by Jus aides-de-camp at \nBennigsen's country house. \n\nIt was a gay and brilliant fete. Connoisseurs \nof such matters declared that rarely had so \nmany beautiful women been assembled in one \nplace. Countess Beziikhova was present among \nother Russian ladies who had followed the sov- \nereign from Petersburg to Vilna and eclipsed \nthe refined Polish ladies by her massive, so- \ncalled Russian type of beauty. The Emperor \nnoticed her and honored her with a dance. \n\nBoris Drubetsk6y, having left his wife in \nMoscow and being for the present en gargon \n(as he phrased it), was also there and, though \nnot an aide-de-camp, had subscribed a large \nsum toward the expenses. Boris was now a rich \nman who had risen to high honors and no \nlonger sought patronage but stood on an equal \nfooting with the highest of those of his own \nage. He was meeting Hlne in Vilna after not \nhaving seen her for a long time and did not \nrecall the past, but as Hdfcne was enjoying the \nfavors of a very important personage and Boris \nhad only recently married, they met as good \nfriends of long standing. \n\nAt midnight dancing was still going on. \nHlne, not having a suitable partner, herself \noffered to dance the mazurka with Boris. They \nwere the third couple. Boris, coolly looking at \nHlne's dazzling bare shoulders which e- \nmerged from a dark, gold-embroidered, gauze \ngown, talked to her of old acquaintances and \nat the same time, unaware of it himself and \nunnoticed by others, never for an instant \nceased to observe the Emperor who was in the \nsame room. The Emperor was not dancing, he \nstood in the doorway, stopping now one pair \nand now another with gracious words which \nhe alone knew how to utter. \n\nAs the mazurka began, Boris saw that Adju- \ntant General Balashev, one of those in closest \nattendance on the Emperor, went up to him \nand contrary to court etiquette stood near him \nwhile he was talking to a Polish lady. Having \nfinished speaking to her, the Emperor looked \ninquiringly at Balashev and, evidently under- \nstanding that he only acted thus because there \nwere important reasons for so doing, nodded \nslightly to the lady and turned to him. Hardly \nhad Balashgv begun to speak before a look of \namazement appeared on the Emperor's face. \nHe took Balashev by the arm and crossed the \nroom with him, unconsciously clearing a path \nseven yards wide as the people on both sides \nmade way for him. Boris noticed Arakchev's \nexcited face when the sovereign went out with \n\n\n\nBalashe'v. Arakche*ev looked at the Emperor \nfrom under his brow and, sniffing with his red \nnose, stepped forward from the crowd as if ex- \npecting the Emperor to address him. (Boris \nunderstood that Arakche"ev envied Balashev \nand was displeased that evidently important \nnews had reached the Emperor otherwise than \nthrough himself.) \n\nBut the Emperor and Balashev passed out \ninto the illuminated garden without noticing \nArakchev who, holding his sword and glanc- \ning wrathfully around, followed some twenty \npaces behind them. \n\nAll the time Boris was going through the \nfigures of the mazurka, he was worried by the \nquestion of what news Balashev had brought \nand how he could find it out before others. \n\nIn the figure in which he had to choose two \nladies, he whispered to Hlne that he meant \nto choose Countess Potocka who, he thought, \nhad gone out onto the veranda, and glided over \nthe parquet to the door opening into the gar- \nden, where, seeing Balashev and the Emperor \nreturning to the veranda, he stood still. They \nwere moving toward the door. Boris, fluttering \nas if he had not had time to withdraw, respect- \nfully pressed close to the doorpost with bowed \nhead. \n\nThe Emperor, with the agitation of one who \nhas been personally affronted, was finishing \nwith these words: \n\n"To enter Russia without declaring war! I \nwill not make peace as long as a single armed \nenemy remains in my country!" \n\nIt seemed to Boris that it gave the Emperor \npleasure to utter these words. He was satisfied \nwith the form in which he had expressed his \nthoughts, but displeased that Boris had over- \nheard it. \n\n"Let no one know of it!" the Emperor added \nwith a frown. \n\nBoris understood that this was meant for \nhim and, closing his eyes, slightly bowed his \nhead. The Emperor re-entered the ballroom \nand remained there about another half-hour. \n\nBoris was thus the first to learn the news \nthat the French army had crossed the Niemen \nand, thanks to this, was able to show certain \nimportant personages that much that was con- \ncealed from others was usually known to him, \nand by this means he rose higher in their esti- \nmation. \n\n\ \n\nThe unexpected news of the French having \ncrossed the Niemen was particularly startling \nafter a month of unfulfilled expectations, and \n\n\n\nBOOK NINE 347 \n\nat a ball. On first receiving the news, under the \n\n\n\ninfluence of indignation and resentment the \nEmperor had found a phrase that pleased him, \nfully expressed his feelings, and has since be- \ncome famous. On returning home at two \no'clock that night he sent for his secretary, \nShishk6v, and told him to write an order to \nthe troops and a rescript to Field Marshal \nPrince Saltyk6v, in which he insisted on the \nwords being inserted that he would not make \npeace so long as a single armed Frenchman re- \nmained on Russian soil. \n\nNext day the following letter was sent to \nNapoleon: \n\nMonsieur mon fr&amp;re, \n\nYesterday I learned that, despite the loyalty with \nwhich I have kept my engagements with Your \nMajesty, your troops have crossed the Russian \nfrontier, and I have this moment received from \nPetersburg a note, in which Count Lauriston in- \nforms me, as a reason for this aggression, that Your \nMajesty has considered yourself to be in a state of \nwar with me from the time Prince Kurakin asked \nfor his passports. The reasons on which the Due \nde Bassano based his refusal to deliver them to \nhim would never have led me to suppose that that \nincident could serve as a pretext for aggression. In \nfact, the ambassador, as he himself has declared, \nwas never authorized to make that demand, and \nas soon as I was informed of it I let him know how \nmuch I disapproved of it and ordered him to re- \nmain at his post. If Your Majesty does not intend \nto shed the blood of our peoples for such a mis- \nunderstanding, and consents to withdraw your \ntroops from Russian territory, I will regard what \nhas passed as not having occurred and an under- \nstanding between us will be possible. In the con- \ntrary case, Your Majesty, I shall see myself forced \nto repel an attack that nothing on my part has \nprovoked. It still depends on Your Majesty to pre- \nserve humanity from the calamity of another war. \nI am, etc., \n\n(signed) ALEXANDER \n\nCHAPTER IV \n\nAT TWO in the morning of the fourteenth of \nJune, the Emperor, having sent for Balashev \nand read him his letter to Napoleon, ordered \nhim to take it and hand it personally to the \nFrench Emperor. When dispatching Balashev, \nthe Emperor repeated to him the worcfc that \nhe would not make peace so long as a single \narmed enemy remained on Russian soil and \ntold him to transmit those words to Napoleon. \nAlexander did not insert them in his letter to \nNapoleon, because with his characteristic tact \nhe felt it would be injudicious to use them at \na moment when a last attempt at reconcili- \n\n\n\n348 \n\nation was being made, but he definitely in- \nstructed Balashev to repeat them personally to \nNapoleon. \n\nHaving set off in the small hours of the four- \nteenth, accompanied by a bugler and two Cos- \nsacks, Balashev reached the French outposts at \nthe village of Ryk6nty, on the Russian side of \nthe Niemen, by dawn. There he was stopped \nby French cavalry sentinels. \n\nA French noncommissioned officer of hus- \nsars, in crimson uniform and a shaggy cap, \nshouted to the approaching Balashev to halt. \nBalashev did not do so at once, but continued \nto advance along the road at a walking pace. \n\nThe noncommissioned officer frowned and, \nmuttering words of abuse, advanced his horse's \nchest against Balashev, put his hand to his \nsaber, and shouted rudely at the Russian gen- \neral, asking: was he deaf that he did not do as \nhe was told? Balashev mentioned who he was. \nThe noncommissioned officer began talking \nwith his comrades about regimental matters \nwithout looking at the Russian general. \n\nAfter living at the seat of the highest author- \nity and power, after conversing with the Em- \nperor less than three hours before, and in gen- \neral being accustomed to the respect due to his \nrank in the service, Balashcv found it very \nstrange here on Russian soil to encounter this \nhostile, and still more this disrespectful, appli- \ncation of brute force to himself. \n\nThe sun was only just appearing from be- \nhind the clouds, the air was fresh and dewy. A \nherd of cattle was being driven along the road \nfrom the village, and over the fields the larks \nrose trilling, one after another, like bubbles \nrising in water. \n\nBalashev looked around him, awaiting the \narrival of an officer from the village. The Rus- \nsian Cossacks and bugler and the French hus- \nsars looked silently at one another from time \nto time. \n\nA French colonel of hussars, who had evi- \ndently just left his bed, came riding from the \nvillage on a handsome sleek gray horse, accom- \npanied by two hussars. The officer, the soldiers, \nand their horses all looked smart and well \nkept. \n\nIt was that first period of a campaign when \ntroops are still in full trim, almost like that of \npeacetime maneuvers, but with a shade of mar- \ntial swagger in their clothes, and a touch of the \ngaiety and spirit of enterprise which always ac- \ncompany the opening of a campaign. \n\nThe French colonel with difficulty repressed \na yawn, but was polite and evidently under- \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\nstood BalasheVs importance. He led him past \nhis soldiers and behind the outposts and told \nhim that his wish to be presented to the Em- \nperor would most likely be satisfied immedi- \nately, as the Emperor's quarters were, he be- \nlieved, not far off. \n\nThey rode through the village of Ryk6nty, \npast tethered French hussar horses, past senti- \nnels and men who saluted their colonel and \nstared with curiosity at a Russian uniform, and \ncame out at the other end of the village. The \ncolonel said that the commander of the divi- \nsion was a mile and a quarter away and would \nreceive Balashev and conduct him to his desti- \nnation. \n\nThe sun had by now risen and shone gaily \non the bright verdure. \n\nThey had hardly ridden up a hill, past a \ntavern, before they saw a group of horsemen \ncoming toward them. In front of the group, on \na black horse with trappings that glittered in \nthe sun, rode a tall man with plumes in his hat \nand black hair curling down to his shoulders. \nHe wore a red mantle, and stretched his long \nlegs forward in French fashion. This man rode \ntoward Balashev at a gallop, his plumes flow- \ning and his gems and gold lace glittering in \nthe bright June sunshine. \n\nBalashev was only two horses' length from \nthe equestrian with the bracelets, plumes, neck- \nlaces, and gold embroidery, who was galloping \ntoward him with a theatrically solemn counte- \nnance, when Julner, the French colonel, whis- \npered respectfully: "The King of Naples!" It \nwas, in fact, Murat, now called "King of Na- \nples." Though it was quite incomprehensible \nwhy he should be King of Naples, he was \ncalled so, and was himself convinced that he \nwas so, and therefore assumed a more solemn \nand important air than formerly. He was so \nsure that he really was the King of Naples that \nwhen, on the eve of his departure from that \ncity, while walking through the streets with his \nwife, some Italians called out to him: "Viva il \nre!" 1 he turned to his wife with a pensive smile \nand said: "Poor fellows, they don't know that I \nam leaving them tomorrow I" \n\nBut though he firmly believed himself to be \nKing of Naples and pitied the grief felt by the \nsubjects he was abandoning, latterly, after he \nhad been ordered to return to military service \nand especially since his last interview with \nNapoleon in Dan/ig, when his august brother- \nin-law had told him: "I made you King that \nyou should reign in my way, but not in yours I" \n\n1 "Long live the King!" \n\n\n\nBOOK NINE \n\n\n\n349 \n\n\n\nhe had cheerfully taken up his familiar busi- \nness, andlike a well-fed but not overfat horse \nthat feels himself in harness and grows skittish \nbetween the shafts he dressed up in clothes \nas variegated and expensive as possible, and \ngaily and contentedly galloped along theroads \nof Poland, without himself knowing why or \nwhither. \n\nOn seeing the Russian general he threw back \nhis head, with its long hair curling to his shoul- \nders, in a majestically royal manner, and looked \ninquiringly at the French colonel. The colonel \nrespectfully informed His Majesty of Balashev's \nmission, whose name he could not pronounce. \n\n"De Bal-machve!" said the King (overcom- \ning by his assurance the difficulty that had pre- \nsented itself to the colonel). "Charmed to make \nyour acquaintance, General!" he added, with \na gesture of kingly condescension. \n\nAs soon as the King began to speak loud \nand fast his royal dignity instantly forsook him, \nand without noticing it he passed into his nat- \nural tone of good-natured familiarity. He laid \nhis hand on the withers of Balashev's horse \nand said: \n\n"Well, General, it all looks like war," as if \nregretting a circumstance of which he was un- \nable to judge. \n\n"Your Majesty," replied Balashev, "my mas- \nter, the Emperor, does not desire war and as \nYour Majesty sees . . ." said Balashe'v, using the \nwords Your Majesty at every opportunity, with \nthe affectation unavoidable in frequently \naddressing one to whom the title was still a \nnovelty. \n\nMurat's face beamed with stupid satisfaction \nas he listened to "Monsieur de Bal-macheve." \nBut royautt oblige!* and he felt it incumbent \non him, as a king and an ally, to confer on \nstate affairs with Alexander's envoy. He dis- \nmounted, took Balashev's arm, and moving a \nfew steps away from his suite, which waited \nrespectfully, began to pace up and down with \nhim, trying to speak significantly. He referred \nto the fact that the Emperor Napoleon had re- \nsented the demand that he should withdraw \nhis troops from Prussia, especially when that \ndemand became generally known and the dig- \nnity of France was thereby offended. \n\nBalashe'v replied that there was nothing of- \nfensive in the demand, because . . . but Murat \ninterrupted him. \n\n"Then you don't consider the Emperor Alex- \nander the aggressor?" he asked unexpectedly, \nwith a kindly and foolish smile. \n\n1 "Royalty has its obligations." \n\n\n\nBalashe'v told him why he considered Napo- \nleon to be the originator of the war. \n\n"Oh, my dear general!" Murat again inter- \nrupted him, "with all my heart I wish the Em- \nperors may arrange the affair between them, \nand that the war begun by no wish of mine \nmay finish as quickly as possiblel" said he, in \nthe tone of a servant who wants to remain \ngood friends with another despite a quarrel \nbetween their masters. \n\nAnd he went on to inquiries about the Grand \nDuke and the state of his health, and to remi- \nniscences of the gay and amusing times he had \nspent with him in Naples. Then suddenly, as \nif remembering his royal dignity, Murat sol- \nemnly drew himself up, assumed the pose in \nwhich he had stood at his coronation, and, wav- \ning his right arm, said: \n\n"I won't detain you longer, General. I wish \nsuccess to your mission," and with his em- \nbroidered red mantle, his flowing feathers, and \nhis glittering ornaments, he rejoined his suite \nwho were respectfully awaiting him. \n\nBalashev rode on, supposing from Murat's \nwords that he would very soon be brought be- \nfore Napoleon himself. But instead of that, at \nthe next village the sentinels of Davout's in- \nfantry corps detained him as the pickets of the \nvanguard had done, and an adjutant of the \ncorps commander, who was fetched, conducted \nhim into the village to Marshal Davout. \n\nCHAPTER V \n\nDAVOUT WAS TO NAPOLEON what Arakchdev \nwas to Alexander though not a coward like \nArakchdev, he was as precise, as cruel, and as \nunable to express his devotion to his monarch \nexcept by cruelty. \n\nIn the organism of states such men are nec- \nessary, as wolves are necessary in the organism \nof nature, and they always exist, always appear \nand hold their own, however incongruous their \npresence and their proximity to the head of \nthe government may be. This inevitability \nalone can explain how the cruel Arakch^ev, \nwho tore out a grenadier's mustache with his \nown hands, whose weak nerves rendered him \nunable to face danger, and who was neither \nan educated man nor a courtier, was able to \nmaintain his powerful position with Alexan- \nder, whose own character was chivalrous, no- \nble, and gentle. \n\nBalashev found Davout seated on a barrel \nin the shed of a peasant's hut, writing he was \nauditing accounts. Better quarters could have \nbeen found him, but Marshal Davout was one \n\n\n\n35 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nof those men who purposely put themselves in \nmost depressing conditions to have a justifica- \ntion for being gloomy. For the same reason \nthey are always hard at work and in a hurry. \n"How can I think of the bright side of life \nwhen, as you see, I am sitting on a barrel and \nworking in a dirty shed?" the expression of \nhis face seemed to say. The chief pleasure and \nnecessity of such men, when they encounter \nanyone who shows animation, is to flaunt their \nown dreary, persistent activity. Davout allowed \nhimself that pleasure when Balashev was \nbrought in. He became still more absorbed in \nhis task when the Russian general entered, and \nafter glancing ove^ his spectacles at BalasheVs \nface, which was animated by the beauty of the \nmorning and by his talk with Murat, he did \nnot rise or even stir, but scowled still more and \nsneered malevolently. \n\nWhen he noticed in Balashev's face the dis- \nagreeable impression this reception produced, \nDavout raised his head and coldly asked what \nhe wanted. \n\nThinking he could have been received in \nsuch a manner only because Davout did not \nknow that he was adjutant general to the Em- \nperor Alexander and even his envoy to Napo- \nleon, Balashev hastened to inform him of his \nrank and mission. Contrary to his expectation, \nDavout, after hearing him, became still surlier \nand ruder. \n\n"Where is your dispatch?" he inquired. \n"Give it to me. I will send it to the Emperor." \n\nBalashev replied that he had been ordered \nto hand it personally to the Emperor. \n\n"Your Emperor's orders are obeyed in your \narmy, but here," said Davout, "you must do \nas you're told." \n\nAnd, as if to make the Russian general still \nmore conscious of his dependence on brute \nforce, Davout sent an adjutant to call the of- \nficer on duty. \n\nBalashev took out the packet containing the \nEmperor's letter and laid it on the table (made \nof a door with its hinges still hanging on it, \nlaid across two barrels). Davout took the packet \nand read the inscription. \n\n"You are perfectly at liberty to treat me with \nrespect or not," protested Balashev, "but per- \nmit me to observe that I have the honor to be \nadjutant general to His Majesty " \n\nDavout glanced at him silently and plainly \nderived pleasure from the signs of agitation \nand confusion which appeared on Balashev's \nface. \n\n"You will be treated as is fitting," said he \n\n\n\nand, putting the packet in his pocket, left the \nshed. \n\nA minute later the marshal's adjutant, de \nCastres, came in and conducted Balashev to \nthe quarters assigned him. \n\nThat day he dined with the marshal, at the \nsame board on the barrels. \n\nNext day Davout rode out early and, after \nasking Balashev to come to him, peremptorily \nrequested him to remain there, to move on \nwith the baggage train should orders come for \nit to move, and to talk to no one except Mon- \nsieur de Castres. \n\nAfter four days of solitude, ennui, and con- \nsciousness of his impotence and insignificance \nparticularly acute by contrast with the sphere \nof power in which he had so lately moved \nand after several marches with the marshal's \nbaggage and the French army, which occupied \nthe whole district, Balashev was brought to Vil- \nna now occupied by the French through the \nvery gate by which he had left it four days pre- \nviously. \n\nNext day the imperial gentleman-in-wait- \ning, the Comte de Turenne, came to Balashev \nand informed him of the Emperor Napoleon's \nwish to honor him with an audience. \n\nFour days before, sentinels of the Preobraz- \nhnsk regiment had stood in front of the house \nto which Balashev was conducted, and now \ntwo French grenadiers stood there in blue uni- \nforms unfastened in front and with shaggy \ncaps on their heads, and an escort of hussars \nand Uhlans and a brilliant suite of aides-de- \ncamp, pages, and generals, who were waiting \nfor Napoleon to come out, were standing at \nthe porch, round his saddle horse and his \nMameluke, Rustan. Napoleon received Bala- \nshev in the very house in Vflna from which \nAlexander had dispatched him on his mission. \n\nCHAPTER VI \n\nTHOUGH BALASHEV was used to imperial pomp, \nhe was amazed at the luxury and magnificence \nof Napoleon's court. \n\nThe Comte de Turenne showed him into a \nbig reception room where many generals, gen- \ntlemen-in-waiting, and Polish magnates sev- \neral of whom Balashev had seen at the court of \nthe Emperor of Russia were waiting. Duroc \nsaid that Napoleon would receive the Russian \ngeneral before going for his ride. \n\nAfter some minutes, the gentleman-in- \nwaiting who was on duty came into the great \nreception room and, bowing politely, asked \nBalashev to follow him. \n\n\n\nBOOK NINE \n\n\n\n35 1 \n\n\n\nBalashe'v went into a small reception room, \none door of which led into a study, the very \none from which the Russian Emperor had dis- \npatched him on his mission. He stood a minute \nor two, waiting. He heard hurried footsteps \nbeyond the door, both halves of it were opened \nrapidly; all was silent and then from the study \nthe sound was heard of other steps, firm and \nresolute they were those of Napoleon. He \nhad just finished dressing for his ride, and \nwore a blue uniform, opening in front over \na white waistcoat so long that it covered his \nrotund stomach, white leather breeches tight- \nly fitting the fat thighs of his short legs, and \nHessian boots. His short hair had evidently \njust been brushed, but one lock hung down in \nthe middle of his broad forehead. His plump \nwhite neck stood out sharply above the black \ncollar of his uniform, and he smelled of Eau \nde Cologne. His full face, rather young-look- \ning, with its prominent chin, wore a gracious \nand majestic expression of imperial welcome. \n\nHe entered briskly, with a jerk at every step \nand his head slightly thrown back. His whole \nshort corpulent figure with broad thick shoul- \nders, and chest and stomach involuntarily pro- \ntruding, had that imposing and stately appear- \nance one sees in men of forty who live in com- \nfort. It was evident, too, that he was in the best \nof spirits that day. \n\nHe nodded in answer to BalasheVs low and \nrespectful bow, and coming up to him at once \nbegan speaking like a man who values every \nmoment of his time and does not condescend \nto prepare what he has to say but is sure he \nwill always say the right thing and say it well. \n\n"Good day, General!" said he. "I have re- \nceived the letter you brought from the Emper- \nor Alexander and am very glad to see you." \nHe glanced with his large eyes into BalasheVs \nface and immediately looked past him. \n\nIt was plain that BalasheVs personality did \nnot interest him at all. Evidently only what \ntook place within his own mind interested him. \nNothing outside himself had any significance \nfor him, because everything in the world, it \nseemed to him, depended entirely on his will. \n\n"I do not, and did not, desire war," he con- \ntinued, "but it has been forced on me. Even \nnow" (he emphasized the word) "I am ready \nto receive any explanations you can give me." \n\nAnd he began clearly and concisely to ex- \nplain his reasons for dissatisfaction with the \nRussian government. Judging by the calmly \nmoderate and amicable tone in which the \nFrench Emperor spoke, Balashev was firmly \n\n\n\npersuaded that he wished for peace and in- \ntended to enter into negotiations. \n\nWhen Napoleon, having finished speaking, \nlooked inquiringly at the Russian envoy, Bala- \nshev began a speech he had prepared long be- \nfore: "Sire! The Emperor, my master . . ." but \nthe sight of the Emperor's eyes bent on him \nconfused him. "You are flurried compose \nyourself!" Napoleon seemed to say, as with a \nscarcely perceptible smile he looked at Bala- \nsheVs uniform and sword. \n\nBalashev recovered himself and began to \nspeak. He said that the Emperor Alexander did \nnot consider Kurakin's demand for his pass- \nports a sufficient cause for war; that Kurdkin \nhad acted on his own initiative and without \nhis sovereign's assent, that the Emperor Alex- \nander did not desire war, and had no relations \nwith England. \n\n"Not yet!" interposed Napoleon, and, as if \nfearing to give vent to his feelings, he frowned \nand nodded slightly as a sign that Balashev \nmight proceed. \n\nAfter saying all he had been instructed to \nsay, Balashev added that the Emperor Alex- \nander wished for peace, but would not enter \ninto negotiations except on condition that . . . \nHere Balashev hesitated: he remembered the \nwords the Emperor Alexander had not writ- \nten in his letter, but had specially inserted in \nthe rescript to Saltyk6v and had told Balashev \nto repeat to Napoleon. Balashev remembered \nthese words, "So long as a single armed foe re- \nmains on Russian soil," but some complex feel- \ning restrained him. He could not utter them, \nthough he wished to do so. He grew confused \nand said: "On condition that the French army \nretires beyond the Niemen." * \n\nNapoleon noticed BalasheVs embarrassment \nwhen uttering these last words; hfc face twitched \nand the calf of his left leg began to quiver rhyth- \nmically. Without moving from where he stood \nhe began speaking in a louder tone and more \nhurriedly than before. During the speech that \nfollowed, Balashev, who more than once low- \nered his eyes, involuntarily noticed the quiver- \ning of Napoleon's left leg which increased the \nmore the more Napoleon raised his voice. \n\n"I desire peace, no less than the Emperor \nAlexander," he began. "Have I not foreighteen \nmonths been doing everything to obtain it? I \nhavewaited eighteen months for explanations. \nBut in order to begin negotiations, what is de- \nmanded of me?" he said, frowning and making \n\n1 The Niemen, in 1812, was the frontier between \nRussia and Poland. TR. \n\n\n\n352 WAR AND PEACE \n\nan energetic gesture of inquiry with his small mencement of the interview. \n\n\n\nwhite plump hand. \n\n"The withdrawal of your army beyond the \nNiemen, sire," replied Balashev. \n\n"The Niemen?" repeated Napoleon. "So \nnow you want me to retire beyond the Niemen \n-only the Niemen?" repeated Napoleon, look- \ning straight at Balashev. \n\nThe latter bowed his head respectfully. \n\nInstead of the demand of four months earli- \ner to withdraw from Pomerania, only a with- \ndrawal beyond the Niemen was now demand- \ned. Napoleon turned quickly and began to \npace the room. \n\n"You say the demand now is that I am to \nwithdraw beyond the Niemen before com- \nmencing negotiations, but in just the same way \ntwo months z^o the demand was that I should \nwithdraw beyond the Vistula and the Oder, \nand yet you are willing to negotiate." \n\nHe went in silence from one corner of the \nroom to the other and again stopped in front \nof Balashev. Balashev noticed that his left leg \nwas quivering faster than before and his face \nseemed petrified in its stern expression. This \nquivering of his left leg was a thing Napoleon \nwas conscious of. "The vibration of my left calf \nis a great sign with me," he remarked at a later \ndate. \n\n**Such demands as to retreat beyond the Vis- \ntula and Oder may be made to a Prince of Ba- \nden, but not tome!" Napoleon almost screamed, \nquite to his own surprise. "If you gave me Pe- \ntersburg and Moscow I could not accept such \nconditions. You say I have begun this war! But \nwho first joined his army? The Emperor Alex- \nander, not I! And you offer me negotiations \nwhen I have expended millions, when you are \nin alliance with England, and when your po- \nsition is a bad one. You offer me negotiations! \nBut what is the aim of your alliance with Eng- \nland? What has she given you?" he continued \nhurriedly, evidently no longer trying to show \nthe advantages of peace and discuss its possibil- \nity, but only to prove his own rectitude and \npower and Alexander's errors and duplicity. \n\nThe commencement of his speech had ob- \nviously been made with the in tendon of demon- \nstrating the advantages of his position and \nshowing that he was nevertheless willing to ne- \ngotiate. But he had begun talking, and the \nmore he talked the less could he control his \nwords. \n\nThe whole purport of his remarks now was \nevidently to exalt himself and insult Alexander \njust what he had least desired at the com- \n\n\n\n"I hear you have made peace with Turkey?" \n\nBalashev bowed his head affirmatively. \n\n"Peace has been concluded ..." he began. \n\nBut Napoleon did not let him speak. He evi- \ndently wanted to do all the talking himself, \nand continued to talk with the sort of elo- \nquence and unrestrained irritability to which \nspoiled people are so prone. \n\n"Yes, I know you have made peace with the \nTurks without obtaining Moldavia and Wal- \nlachia; I would have given your sovereign those \nprovinces as I gave him Finland. Yes," he \nwent on, "I promised and would have given \nthe Emperor Alexander Moldavia and Walla- \nchia, and now he won't have those splendid \nprovinces. Yet he might have united them to \nhis empire and in a single reign would have \nextended Russia from the Gulf of Bothnia to \nthe mouths of the Danube. Catherine the Great \ncould not have done more," said Napoleon, \ngrowing more and more excited as he paced \nup and down the room, repeating to Balashtiv \nalmost the very words he had used to Alexan- \nder himself at Tilsit. "All that, he would have \nowed to my friendship. Oh, what a splendid \nreign!" he repeated several times, then paused, \ndrew from his pocket a gold snuffbox, lifted it \nto his nose, and greedily sniffed at it. \n\n"What a splendid reign the Emperor Alex- \nander's might have been!" \n\nHe looked compassionately at Balashev, and \nas soon as the latter tried to make some rejoin- \nder hastily interrupted him. \n\n"What could he wish or look for that he \nwould not have obtained through my friend- \nship?" demanded Napoleon, shrugging his \nshoulders in perplexity. "But no, he has pre- \nferred to surround himself with my enemies, \nand with whom? With Steins, Armfeldts, Ben- \nnigsens, and Wintzingerodes! Stein, a traitor \nexpelled from his own country; Armfeldt, a \nrake and an intriguer; Wintzingerode, a fugi- \ntive French subject; Bennigsen, rather more of \na soldier than the others, but all the same an \nincompetent who was unable to do anything \nin 1807 and who should awaken terrible mem- \nories in the Emperor Alexander's mind. . . . \nGranted that were they competent they might \nbe made use of," continued Napoleonhardly \nable to keep pace in words with the rush of \nthoughts that incessantly sprang up, proving \nhow right and strong he was (in his perception \nthe two were one and the same) "but they are \nnot even that! They are neither fit for war nor \npeace! Barclay is said to be the most capable \n\n\n\nBOOK NINE \n\n\n\n353 \n\n\n\nof them all, but I cannot say so, judging by his \nfirst movements. And what are they doing, all \nthese courtiers? Pfuel proposes, Armfeldt dis- \nputes, Bennigsen considers, and Barclay, called \non to act, does not know what to decide on, and \ntime passes bringing no result. Bagrati6n alone \nis a military man. He's stupid, but he has ex- \nperience, a quick eye, and resolution. . . . And \nwhat role is your young monarch playing in \nthat monstrous crowd? They compromise him \nand throw on him the responsibility for all \nthat happens. A sovereign should not be with \nthe army unless he is a general I" said Napole- \non, evidently uttering these words as a direct \nchallenge to the Emperor. He knew how Alex- \nander desired to be a military commander. \n\n"The campaign began only a week ago, and \nyou haven't even been able to defend Vilna. \nYou are cut in two and have been driven out \nof the Polish provinces. Your army is grum- \nbling." \n\n"On the contrary, Your Majesty," said Bala- \nshev, hardly able to remember what had been \nsaid to him and following these verbal fireworks \nwith difficulty, "the troops are burning with \neagerness . . ." \n\n"I know everything!" Napoleon interrupted \nhim. "I know everything. I know the number \nof your battalions as exactly as I know my own. \nYou have not two hundred thousand men, and \nI have three times that number. I give you my \nword of honpr/'said Napoleon, forgetting that \nhis word of honor could carry no weight "I \ngive you my word of honor that I have five hun- \ndred and thirty thousand men this side of the \nVistula. The Turks will be of no use to you; \nthey are worth nothing and have shown it by \nmaking peace with you. As for the Swedes it is \ntheir fate to be governed by mad kings. Their \nking was insane and they changed him for an- \nother Bernadotte, who promptly went mad \nfor no Swede would ally himself with Russia \nunless he were mad." \n\nNapoleon grinned maliciously and again \nraised his snuffbox to his nose. \n\nBalashev knew how to reply to each of Na- \npoleon's remarks, and would have done so; he \ncontinually made the gesture of a man wishing \nto say something, but Napoleon always inter- \nrupted him. To the alleged insanity of the \nSwedes, Balashev wished to reply that when \nRussia is on her side Sweden is practically an \nisland: but Napoleon gave an angry exclama- \ntion to drown his voice. Napoleon was in that \nstate of irritability in which a man has to talk, \ntalk, and talk, merely to convince himself that \n\n\n\nhe is -in the right. Balashev began to feel un- \ncomfortable: as envoy he feared to demean his \ndignity and felt the necessity of replying; but, \nas a man, he shrank before the transport of \ngroundless wrath that had evidently seized Na- \npoleon. He knew that none of the words now \nuttered by Napoleon had any significance, and \nthat Napoleon himself would be ashamed of \nthem when he came to his senses. Balashev \nstood with downcast eyes, looking at the move- \nments of Napoleon's stout legs and trying to \navoid meeting his eyes. \n\n"But what do I care about your allies?" said \nNapoleon. "I have allies the Poles. There are \neighty thousand of them and they fight like \nlions. And there will be two hundred thousand \nof them." \n\nAnd probably still more perturbed by the \nfact that he had uttered this obvious falsehood, \nand that Balashev still stood silently before \nhim in the same attitude of submission to fate, \nNapoleon abruptly turned round, drew close \nto Balashev's face, and, gesticulating rapidly \nand energetically with his white hands, almost \nshouted: \n\n"Know that if you stir up Prussia against me, \nI'll wipe it off the map of Europe!" hedeclared, \nhis face pale and distorted by anger, and he \nstruck one of hissmall hands energetically with \nthe other. "Yes, I will throw you back beyond \nthe Dvina and beyond the Dnieper, and will \nre-erect against you that barrier * which it was \ncriminal and blind of Europe to allow to be de- \nstroyed. Yes, that is what will happen to you. \nThat is what you have gained by alienating \nme!" And he walked silently several times up \nand down the room, his fat shoulders twitch- \ning. \n\nHe put his snuffbox into his waistcoat pock- \net, took it out again, lifted it several times to \nhis nose, and stopped in front of Balashev. He \npaused, looked ironically straight into Bala- \nsheVs eyes, and said in a quiet voice: \n\n"And yet what a splendid reign your master \nmight have had!" \n\nBalashev, feeling it incumbent on him to re- \nply, said that from the Russian side things did \nnot appear in so gloomy a light. Napoleon was \nsilent, still looking derisively at him and evi- \ndently not listening to him. Balashev said that \nin Russia the best results were expected from \nthe war. Napoleon nodded condescendingly, as \nif to say, "I know it's your duty to say that, but \nyou don't believe it yourself. I have convinced \nyou." \n\n1 Namely, a large Polish state. TR. \n\n\n\n354 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nWhen Balashev had ended, Napoleon again \ntook out his snuffbox, sniffed at it, and stamped \nhis foot twice on the floor as a signal. The door \nopened, a gentleman-in-waiting, bending re- \nspectfully, handed the Emperor his hat and \ngloves; another brought him a pocket handker- \nchief. Napoleon, without giving them a glance, \nturned to Balashev: \n\n"Assure the Emperor Alexander from me," \nsaid he, taking his hat, "that I am as devoted \nto him as before: I know him thoroughly and \nvery highly esteem his lofty qualities. I will de- \ntain you no longer, General; you shall receive \nmy letter to the Emperor." \n\nAnd Napoleon went quickly to the door. Ev- \neryone in the reception room rushed forward \nand descended the staircase. \n\n\n\nVII \n\nAFTER ALL THAT Napoleon had said to him \nthose bursts of anger and the last dryly spoken \nwords: "I will detain you no longer, General; \nyou shall receive my letter," Balashev felt con- \nvinced that Napoleon would not wish to see \nhim, and would even avoid another meeting \nwith him an insulted envoy especially as he \nhad witnessed his unseemly anger. But, to his \nsurprise, Balashev received, through Duroc, an \ninvitation to dine with the Emperor that day. \n\nBessi&amp;res, Caulaincourt, and Berthier were \npresent at that dinner. \n\nNapoleon met Balashev cheerfully and ami- \nably. He not only showed no sign of constraint \nor self-reproach on account of his outburst that \nmorning, but, on the contrary, tried to reas- \nsure Balashev. It was evident that he had long \nbeen convinced that it was impossible for him \nto make a mistake, and that in his perception \nwhatever he did was right, not because it har- \nmonized with any idea of right and wrong, but \nbecause he did it. \n\nThe Emperor was in very good spirits after \nhis ride through Vilna, where crowds of peo- \nple had rapturously greeted and followed him. \nFrom all the windows of the streets through \nwhich he rode, rugs, flags, and his monogram \nwere displayed, and the Polish ladies, welcom- \ning him, waved their handkerchiefs to him. \n\nAt dinner, having placed Balashev beside \nhim, Napoleon not only treated him amiably \nbut behaved as if Balashev were one of his own \ncourtiers, one of those who sympathized with \nhis plans and ought to rejoice at his success. In \nthe course of conversation he mentioned Mos- \ncow and questioned Balashev about the Rus- \nsian capital, not merely as an interested trav- \n\n\n\neler asks about a new city he intends to visit, \nbut as if convinced that Balashev, as a Russian, \nmust be flattered by his curiosity. \n\n"How many inhabitants are there in Mos- \ncow? How many houses? Is it true that Moscow \nis called 'Holy Moscow'? How many churches \nare there in Moscow?" he asked. \n\nAnd receiving the reply that there were more \nthan two hundred churches, he remarked: \n\n"Why such a quantity of churches?" \n\n"The Russians are very devout," replied Bal- \nashev. \n\n"But a large number of monasteries and \nchurches is always a sign of the backwardness \nof a people," said Napoleon, turning to Cau- \nlaincourt for appreciation of this remark. \n\nBalashev respectfully ventured to disagree \nwith the French Emperor. \n\n"Every country has its own character," said \nhe. \n\n"But nowhere in Europe is there anything \nlike that," said Napoleon. \n\n"I beg Your Majesty's pardon," returned Bal- \nashev, "besides Russia there is Spain, where \nthere are also many churches and monasteries." \n\nThis reply of BalasheVs, which hinted at the \nrecent defeats of the French in Spain, was \nmuch appreciated when he related it at Alex- \nander's court, but it was not much appreciated \nat Napoleon's dinner, where it passed unno- \nticed. \n\nThe uninterested and perplexed faces of \nthe marshals showed that they were puzzled as \nto what BalasheVs tone suggested. "If there is \na point we don't see it, or it is not at all witty," \ntheir expressions seemed to say. So little was \nhis rejoinder appreciated that Napoleon did \nnot notice it at all and naively asked Balashev \nthrough what towns the direct road from there \nto Moscow passed. Balashev, who was on the \nalert all through the dinner, replied that just \nas "all roads lead to Rome," so all roads lead \nto Moscow: there were many roads, and "among \nthem the road through Poltdva, which Charles \nXII chose." Balashev involuntarily flushed \nwith pleasure at the aptitude of this reply, but \nhardly had he uttered the word Poltdva before \nCaulaincourt began speaking of the badness of \nthe road from Petersburg to Moscow and of \nhis Petersburg reminiscences. \n\nAfter dinner they went to drink coffee in Na- \npoleon's study, which four days previously had \nbeen that of the Emperor Alexander. Napole- \non sat down, toying with his S&amp;vres coffee cup, \nand motioned Balashev to a chair beside him. \n\nNapoleon was in that well-known after-din- \n\n\n\nBOOK NINE \n\n\n\nS55 \n\n\n\nner mood which, more than any reasoned cause, \nmakes a man contented with himself and dis- \nposed to consider everyone his friend. Itseemed \nto him that he was surrounded by men who \nadored him: and he felt convinced that, after \nhis dinner, Balashev too was his friend and wor- \nshiper. Napoleon turned to him with a pleas- \nant, though slightly ironic, smile. \n\n"They tell me this is the room the Emperor \nAlexander occupied? Strange, isn't it, Gener- \nal?" he said, evidently not doubting that this \nremark would be agreeable to his hearer since \nit went to prove his, Napoleon's, superiority to \nAlexander. \n\nBalashev could make no reply and bowed his \nhead in silence. \n\n"Yes. Four days ago in this room, Wintzing- \nerode and Stein were deliberating," continued \nNapoleon with the same derisive and self-con- \nfident smile. "What I can't understand," he \nwent on, "is that the Emperor Alexander has \nsurrounded himself with my personal enemies. \nThat I do not . . . understand. Has he not \nthought that I may do thesame?"and he turned \ninquiringly to Balashev, and evidently this \nthought turned him back on to the track of his \nmorning's anger, which was still fresh in him. \n\n"And let him know that I will do sol" said \nNapoleon, rising and pushing his cup away \nwith his hand. "I'll drive all his Wiirttemberg, \nBaden, and Weimar relations out of Germany. \n. . . Yes. I'll drive them out. Let him prepare \nan asylum for them in Russial" \n\nBalashev bowed his head with an air indicat- \ning that he would like to make his bow and \nleave, and only listened because he could not \nhelp hearing what was said to him. Napoleon \ndid not notice this expression; he treated Bal- \nashev not as an envoy from his enemy, but as a \nman now fully devoted to him and who must \nrejoice at his former master's humiliation. \n\n"And why has the Emperor Alexander taken \ncommand of the armies? What is the good of \nthat? War is my profession, but his business is \nto reign and not to command armies 1 Why has \nhe taken on himself such a responsibility?" \n\nAgain Napoleon brought out his snuffbox, \npaced several times up and down the room in \nsilence, and then, suddenly and unexpectedly, \nwent up to Balashev and with a slight smile, as \nconfidently, quickly, and simply as if he were \ndoing something not merely important but \npleasing to Balashev, he raised his hand to the \nforty-year-old Russian general's face and, tak- \ning him by the ear, pulled it gently, smiling \nwith his lips only. \n\n\n\nTo have one's ear pulled by the Emperor \nwas considered the greatest honor and mark of \nfavor at the French court. \n\n"Well, adorer and courtier of the Emperor \nAlexander, why don't you say anything?" said \nhe, as if it was ridiculous, in his presence, to be \nthe adorer and courtier of anyone but himself, \nNapoleon. "Are the horses ready for the gener- \nal?" he added, with a slight inclination of \nhis head in reply to BalasheVs bow. "Let him \nhave mine, he has a long way to go/" \n\nThe letter taken by Balashev was the last \nNapoleon sent to Alexander. Every detail of \nthe interview was communicated to the Rus- \nsian monarch, and the war began. . . . \n\nCHAPTER VIII \n\nAFTER HIS INTERVIEW with Pierre in Moscow, \nPrince Andrew went to Petersburg, on business \nas he told his family, bufirdrtTy^^eet Ana- \ntole Kurdgin whom he felt it necessary to en- \ncounter. On reaching Petersburg he inquired \nfor Kuragin but the latter had already left the \ncity. Pierre had warned his brother-in-law that \nPrince Andrew was on his track. Anatole Kura- \ngin promptly obtained an appointment from \nthe Minister of War and went to join the army \nin Moldavia. While in Petersburg Prince An- \ndrew met Kutiizov, his former commander who \nwas always well disposed toward him, and Ku- \ntiizov suggested that he should accompany him \nto the army in Moldavia, to which the old gen- \neral had been appointed commander in chief. \nSo Prince Andrew, having received an appoint- \nment on the headquarters staff, left for Turkey. \nPrince Andrew did not think it proper to \nwrite and challenge Kurdgin. He thought that \nif he challenged him without some fresh cause \nit might compromise the young Countess Ros- \nt6va and so he wanted to meet Kurdgin per- \nsonally in order to find a fresh pretext for a \nduel. But he again failed to meet Kuragin in \nTurkey, for soon after Prince Andrew arrived, \nthe latter re turned to Russia. In a new country, \namid new conditions, Prince Andrew found \nlife easier to bear. After his betrothed had brok- \nen faith with him which he felt the more a- \ncutely the more he tried to conceal its effects \nthe surroundings in which he had been happy \nbecame trying to him, and the freedom and in- \ndependence he had once prized so highly were \nstill more so. Not only could he no longer think \nthe thoughts that had first come to him as he \nlay gazing at the sky on the field of Austerlitz \nand had later enlarged upon with Pierre, and \nwhich had filled his solitude at Boguchdrovo \n\n\n\n356 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nand then in Switzerland and Rome, but he \neven dreaded to recall them and the bright and \nboundless horizons they had revealed. He was \nnow concerned only with the nearest practical \nmatters unrelated to his past interests, and he \nseized on these the more eagerly the more those \npast interests were closed to him. It was as if \nthat lofty, infinite canopy of heaven that had \nonce towered above him had suddenly turned \ninto a low, solid vault that weighed him down, \nin which all was clear, but nothing eternal or \nmysterious. \n\nOf the activities that presented themselves to \nhim, army service was the simplest and most \nfamiliar. As a general on duty on Kutuzov's \nstaff, he applied himself to business with zeal \nand perseverance and surprised Kutiizov by his \nwillingness and accuracy in work. Not having \nfound KurAgin in Turkey, Prince Andrew did \nnot thinkJj^Q^x^iK to rush back to Russia \nafter him, but all the sime he knew that how- \never long it might be before he met Kur&amp;gin, \ndespite his contempt for him and despite all \nthe proofs he deduced to convince himself that \nit was not worth stooping to a conflict with him \nhe knew that when he did meet him he would \nnot be able to resist calling him out, any more \nthan a ravenous man can help snatching at \nfood. And the consciousness that the insult was \nnot yet avenged, that his rancor was still un- \nspent, weighed on his heart and poisoned the \nartificial tranquillity which he managed to ob- \ntain in Turkey by means of restless, plodding, \nand rather vainglorious and ambitious activity. \n\nI n the year 1812, when news of the war with \nNapoleon reached Bucharest where Kutu/ov \nhad been living for two months, passing his \ndays and nights with a Wallachian woman- \nPrince Andrew asked Kutiizov to transfer him \nto the Western Army. Kutuzov, who was al- \nready weary of Bolk6nski's activity which \nseemed to reproach his own idleness, very read- \nily let him go and gave him a mission to Bar- \nclay de Tolly. \n\nBefore joining the Western Army which was \nthen, in May, encamped at Drissa, Prince An- \ndrew visited Bald Hills which was directly on \nhis way, being only two miles off the Smolensk \nhighroad. During the last three years there had \nbeen so many changes in his life, he had thought, \nfelt, and seen so much (having traveled both \nin the east and the west), that on reaching Bald \nHills it struck him as strange and unexpected \nto find the way of life there unchanged and still \nthe same in every detail. He entered through \nthe gates with their stone pillars and drove up \n\n\n\nthe avenue leading to the house as if he were \nentering an enchanted, sleeping castle. The \nsame old stateliness, the same cleanliness, the \nsame stillness reigned there, and inside there \nwas the same furniture, the same walls, sounds, \nand smell, and the same timid faces, only some- \nwhat older. Princess Mary was still the same tim- \nid, plain maiden getting on in years, uselessly \nand joylessly passing the bestyearsof her life in \nfearand constant suffering. Mademoiselle Bou- \nrienne was the same coquettish, self-satisfied \ngirl, enjoying every moment of her existence \nand full of joyous hopes for the future. She \nhad merely become more self-confident, Prince \nAndrew thought. Dessalles, the tutor he had \nbrought from Switzerland, was wearing a coat \nof Russian cut and talking broken Russian to \nthe servants, but was still the same narrowly in- \ntelligent, conscientious, and pedantic precep- \ntor. The old prince had changed in appearance \nonly by the loss of a tooth, which left a notice- \nable gap on one side of his mouth; in character \nhe was the same as ever, only showing still more \nirritability and skepticism as to what was hap- \npening in the world. Little Nicholas alone had \nchanged. He had grown, become rosier, had \ncurly dark hair, and, when merry and laugh- \ning, quite unconsciously lifted the upper lip \nof his pretty little mouth just as the little prin- \ncess used to do. He alone did not obey the law \nof immutability in the enchanted, sleeping cas- \ntle. But though externally all remained as of \nold, the inner relations of all these people had \nchanged since Prince Andrew had seen them \nlast. The household was divided into two alien \nand hostile camps, who changed their habits \nfor his sake and only met because he was there. \nTo the one camp belonged the old prince, Mad- \nmoiselle Bourienne, and the architect; to the \nother Princess Mary, Dessalles, little Nicholas, \nand all the old nurses and maids. \n\nDuring his stay at Bald Hills all the family \ndined together, but they were ill at ease and \nPrince Andrew felt that he was a visitor for \nwhose sake an exception was being made and \nthat his presence made them all feel awkward. \nInvoluntarily feeling this at dinner on the \nfirst day, he was taciturn, and the old prince \nnoticing this also became morosely dumb and \nretired to his apartments directly after dinner. \nIn the evening, when Prince Andrew went to \nhim and, trying to rouse him, began to tell \nhim of the young Count Kmensky's campaign, \nthe old prince began unexpectedly to talk \nabout Princess Mary, blaming her for her \nsuperstitions and her dislike of Mademoiselle \n\n\n\nBOOK \n\nBourienne, who, he said, was the only person \nreally attached to him. \n\nThe old prince said that if he was ill it was \nonly because of Princess Mary: that she pur- \nposely worried and irritated him, and that by \nindulgence and silly talk she was spoiling little \nPrince Nicholas. The old prince knew very well \nthat he tormented his daughter and that her \nlife was very hard, but he also knew that he \ncould not help tormenting her and that she de- \nserved it. "Why does Prince Andrew, who sees \nthis, say nothing to me about his sister? Docs \nhe think me a scoundrel, or an old fool who, \nwithout any reason, keeps his own daughter at \na distance and attaches this Frenchwoman to \nhimself? He doesn't understand, so I must ex- \nplain it, and hemust hearme out," thought the \nold prince. And he began explaining why he \ncould not put up with his daughter's unreason- \nable character. \n\n"If you ask me," said Prince Andrew, with- \nout looking up (he was censuring his father \nfor the first time in his life), "I did not wish to \nspeak about it, but as you ask me 1 will give \nyou niy frank opinion. If there is any misun- \nderstanding a nd discord between you a nd Mary-, \nI can't blame her for it at all. 1 know how she \nloves and respects you. Since you ask me," \ncontinued Prince Andrew, becoming irritable \nas he was always liable to do of late "I can \nonly say that if there are any misunderstand- \nings they are caused by that worthless woman, \nwho is not fit to be my sister's companion." \n\nThe old man at first stared fixedly at his son, \nand an unnatural smile disclosed the fresh gap \nbetween his teeth to which Prince Andrew \ncould not get accustomed. \n\n"What companion, my dear boy? Eh? You've \nalready been talking it over! Eh?" \n\n"Father, I did not want to judge," said \nPrince Andrew, in a hard and bitter tone, "but \nyou challenged me, and I have said, and always \nshall say, that Mary is not to blame, but Ihose \nto blamethe one to blame is that French- \nwoman." \n\n"Ah, he has passed judgment . . . passed judg- \nment!" said the old man in a low voice and, as \nit seemed to Prince Andrew, with some embar- \nrassment, but then he suddenly jumped up and \ncried: "Be off, be off! Let not a trace of you re- \nmain here! . . ." \n\nPrince Andrew wished to leave at once, but \nPrincess Mary persuaded him to stay another \nday. That day he did not see his father, who \ndid not leave his room and admitted no one \n\n\n\nNINE 357 \n\nbut Mademoiselle Bourienne and Tikhon, but \nasked several times whether his son had gone. \nNext day, before leaving, Prince Andrew went \nto his son's rooms. The boy, curly-headed like \nhis mother and glowing with health, sat on his \nknee, and Prince Andrew began telling him \nthe story of Bluebeard, but fell into a reverie \nwithout finishing the story. He thought not of \nthis pretty child, his son whom he held on his \nknee, but of himself. He sought in himself ei- \nther remorse for having angered his father or \nregret at leaving home for the first time in his \nlife on bad terms with him, and was horrified \nto find neither. What meant still more to him \nwas that he sought and did not find in himself \nthe former tenderness for his son which he had \nhoped to reawaken by caressing the boy and \ntaking him on his knee. \n\n"Well, go on!" said r .VstfnjiiowiL \n\nPrince Andrew, witnout replyirfgV put him \ndown from his knee and went out of the room. \n\nAs soon as Prince Andrew had given up his \ndaily occupations, and especially on returning \nto the old conditions of life amid which he had \nbeen happy, weariness of life overcame him \nwith its former intensity, and he hastened to \nescape from these memories and to find some \nwork as soon as possible. \n\n"So you've decided to go, Andrew?" asked \nhis sister. \n\n"Thank God that I can," replied Prince An- \ndrew. "1 am very sorry you can't." \n\n"Why do you say that?" replied Princess \nMary. "Why do you say that, when you are go- \ning to this terrible war, and he is so old? Made- \nmoiselle Bourienne says he has been asking \nabout you. ..." \n\nAs soon as she began to speak of that, her \nlips trembled and her tears began to fall. Prince \nAndrew turned away and began pacing the \nroom. \n\n"Ah, my God! my God! When one thinks \nwho and what what trash can cause people \nmisery!" he said with a malignity that alarmed \nPrincess Mary. \n\nShe understood that when speakingof "trash" \nhe referred not only to Mademoiselle Bouri- \nenne, the cause of her misery, but also to the \nman who had ruined his own happiness. \n\n"Andrew! One thing I beg, I entreat of you!" \nshe said, touching his elbow and looking at \nhim with eyes that shone through her tears. "1 \nunderstand you" (she looked down). "Don't \nimagine that sorrow is the work of men. Meri \nare His tools." She looked a little above Prince \nAndrew's head with the confident, accustomed \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nlook with which one looks at the place where \na familiar portrait hangs. "Sorrow is sent by \nHim, not by men. Men are His instruments, \nthey are not to blame. II you think someone \nhas wronged you, forget it and forgivel We \nhave no right to punish. And then you will \nknow the happiness of forgiving." \n\n"If I were a woman I would do so, Mary. \nThat is a woman's virtue. But a man should \nnot and cannot forgive and forget," he replied, \nand though till that moment he had not been \nthinking of Kuragin, all his unexpended anger \nsuddenly swelled up in his heart. \n\n"If Mary is already persuading me to forgive, \nit means that I ought longago to have punished \nhim," he thought. And giving her no further \nreply, he began thinking of the glad vindictive \nmoment when he would meet Kuriigin who he \nknew y^ *w-'*&gt; fee ^my. \n\nPrincciVMary beggecj him to stay one day \nmore, saying that she kil*w how unhappy her \nfather would be if AndreV left without being \nreconciled to him, but Prince Andrew replied \nthat he would probably soon be back again \nfrom the army and would certainly write to his \nfather, but that the longer he stayed now the \nmore embittered their differences would be- \ncome. \n\n"Good-by, Andrew! Remember that misfor- \ntunes come from God, and men are never to \nblame," were the last words he heard from his \nsister when he took leave of her. \n\n"Then it must be so!" thought Prince An- \ndrew as he drove out of the avenue from the \nhouse at Bald Hills. "She, poor innocent crea- \nture, is left to be victimized by an old man who \nhas outlived his wits. The old man feels he is \nguilty, but cannot change himself. My boy is \ngrowing up and rejoices in life, in which like \neverybody else he will deceive or be deceived. \nAnd I am off to the army. Why? I myself don't \nknow. I want to meet that man whom I despise, \nso as to give him a chance to kill and laugh at \nme!" \n\nThese conditions of life had been the same \nbefore, but then they were all connected, while \nnow they had all tumbled to pieces. Only \nsenseless things, lacking coherence, presented \nthemselves one after another to Prince An- \ndrew's mind. \n\nCHAPTER IX \n\nPRINCE ANDREW reached the general headquar- \nters of the army at the end of June. The first \narmy, with which was the Emperor, occupied \nthe fortified camp at Drissa; the second army \n\n\n\nwas retreating, trying to effect a junction with \nthe first one from which it was said to be cut off \nby large French forces. Everyone was dissatis- \nfied with the general course of affairs in the \nRussian army, but no one anticipated any dan- \nger of invasion of the Russian provinces, and \nno one thought the war would extend farther \nthan the western, the Polish, provinces. \n\nPrince Andrew found Barclay de Tolly, to \nwhom he had been assigned, on the bank of \nthe Drissa. As there was not a single town or \nlarge village in the vicinity of the camp, the \nimmense number ot generals and courtiers ac- \ncompanying the army were living in the best \nhouses of the villages on both sides of the river, \nover a radius of six miles. Barclay de Tolly was \nquartered nearly three miles from the Emperor. \nHe received Bolkonski stiflly and coldly and \ntold him in his foreign accent that he would \nmention him to the Emperor for a decision as \nto his employment, but asked him meanwhile to \nremain on his staff. Anatole Kuragin, whom \nPrince Andrew had hoped to find with the ar- \nmy, was not there. He had gone to Petersburg, \nbut Prince Andrew was glad to hear this. His \nmind was occupied by the interests of the cen- \nter that was conducting a gigantic war, and he \nwas glad to be free for a while from the distrac- \ntion caused by the thought of Kuragin. Dur- \ning the first four days, while no duties were re- \nquired of him, Prince Andrew rode round the \nwhole fortified camp and, by the aid of his own \nknowledge and by talks with experts, tried to \nform a definite opinion about it. But the ques- \ntion whether the camp was advantageous or \ndisadvantageous remained for him undecided. \nAlready from his military experience and what \nhe had seen in the Austrian campaign, he had \ncome to the conclusion that in war the most \ndeeply considered plans have no significance \nand that all depends on the way unexpected \nmovements of the enemy that cannot be fore- \nseenare met, and on how and by whom the \nwhole matter is handled. To clear up this last \npoint for hiiqself, Prince Andrew, utilizing his \nposition and acquaintances, tried to fathom \nthe character of the control of the army arid of \nthe men and parties engaged in it, and he de- \nduced for himself the following idea of the state \nof affairs. \n\nWhile the Emperor had still been at Vflna, \nthe forces had been divided into three armies. \nFirst, the army under Barclay de Tolly, second- \nly, the army under Bagrati6n, and thirdly, the \none commanded by Tormdsov. The Emperor \nwas with the first army, but not as commander \n\n\n\nBOOK NINE \n\n\n\n359 \n\n\n\nin chief. In the orders issued it was stated, not \nthat the Emperor would take command, but \nonly that he would be with the army. The Em- \nperor, moreover, had with him not a command- \ner in chief's staff but the imperial headquarters \nstaff. In attendance on him was the head of the \nimperial staff, Quartermaster General Prince \nVolkonski, as well as generals, imperial aides- \nde-camp, diplomatic officials, and a large num- \nber of foreigners, but not the army staff. \nBesides these, there were in attendance on the \nEmperor without any definite appointments: \nArakch^ev, the ex-Minister of War; Count Bcn- \nnigsen, the senior general in rank; the Grand \nDukeTsard-vich Constantine Pavlovich; Count \nRumydntsev, the Chancellor; Stein, a former \nPrussian minister; Armfeldt, a Swedish gener- \nal; Pfuel, the chief author of the plan of cam- \npaign; Paulucci, an adjutant general and Sar- \ndinian emigrd; Wolzogen and many others. \nThough these men had no military appoint- \nment in the army, their position gave them in- \nfluence, and often a corps commander, or even \nthe commander in chief, did not know in what \ncapacity he was questioned by Bennigsen, the \nGrand Duke, Arakchdev, or Prince Volkonski, \nor was given this or that advice and did not know \nwhether a certain order received in the form of \nadvice emanated from the man who gave it or \nfrom the Emperor and whether it had to be ex- \necuted or not. But this was only the external \ncondition; the essential significance of the \npresence of the Emperor and of all these peo- \nple, from a courtier's point of view (and in an \nEmperor's vicinity all became courtiers), was \nclear to everyone. It was this: the Emperor did \nnot assume the title of commander in chief, but \ndisposed of all the armies; the men around him \nwere his assistants. Arakch^ev was a faithful \ncustodian to enforce order and acted as the sov- \nereign's bodyguard. Bennigsen was a landlord \nin the Vilna province who appeared to be do- \ning the honors of the district, but was in real- \nity a good general, useful as an adviser and \nready at hand to replace Barclay. The Grand \nDuke was there because it suited him to be. The \nex-Minister Stein was there because his advice \nwas useful and the Emperor Alexander held \nhim in high esteem personally. Armfeldt viru- \nlently hated Napoleon and was a general full \nof self-confidence, a quality that always influ- \nenced Alexander. Paulucci was there because \nhe was bold and decided in speech. The adju- \ntants general were there because they always \naccompanied the Emperor, and lastly and chief- \nly Pfuel was there because he had drawn up \n\n\n\nthe plan of campaign against Napoleon and, \nhaving induced Alexander to believe in the \nefficacy of that plan, was directing the whole \nbusiness of the war. With Pfuel was Wolzogen, \nwho expressed Pfuel's thoughts in a more com- \nprehensible way than Pfuel himself (who was \na harsh, bookish theorist, self-confident to the \npoint of despising everyone else) was able to \ndo. \n\nBesides these Russians and foreigners who \npropounded new and unexpected ideas every \nday especially the foreigners, who did so with \na boldness characteristic of people employed in \na country not their own there were many sec- \nondary personages accompanying the army be- \ncause their principals were there. \n\nAmong the opinions and voices in this im- \nmense, restless, brilliant, and proud sphere, \nPrince Andrew noticed the following sharply \ndefined subdivisions of tendencies and parties: \n\nThe first party consisted of Pfuel and his ad- \nherentsmilitary theorists who believed in a \nscience of war with immutable laws laws of \noblique movements, outflankings, and so forth. \nPfuel and hisadherentsdemanded a retirement \ninto the depths of the country in accordance \nwith precise laws defined by a pseudo-theory \nof war, and they saw only barbarism, ignorance, \nor evil intention in every deviation from that \ntheory. To this party belonged the foreign no- \nbles, Wolzogen, Wintzingerode, and others, \nchiefly Germans. \n\nThe second party was directly opposed to the \nfirst; one extreme, as always happens, was met \nby representatives of the other. The members \nof this party were those who had demanded an \nadvance from Vilna into Poland and freedom \nfrom all prearranged plans. Besides being ad- \nvocates ot bold action, this section also repre- \nsented nationalism, which made them still more \none-sided in the dispute. They were Russians: \nBagration, Ermolov (who was beginning to \ncome to the front), and others. At that time a \nfamous joke of Erm61ov's was being circulated, \nthat as a great favor he had petitioned the Em- \nperor to make him a German. The men of that \nparty, remembering Suv6rov, said that what \none had to do was not to reason, or stick pins \ninto maps, but to fight, beat the enemy, keep \nhim out of Russia, and not let the army get dis- \ncouraged. \n\nTo the third party in which the Emperor \nhad most confidence belonged the courtiers \nwho tried to arrange compromises between the \nother two. The members of this party, chiefly \ncivilians and to whom Arakche'ev belonged, \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nthought and said what men who have no con- \nvictions but wish to seem to have some gener- \nally say. They said that undoubtedly war, par- \nticularly against such a genius as Bonaparte \n(they called him Bonaparte now), needs most \ndeeply devised plans and profound scientific \nknowledge and in that respect Pfuel was a \ngenius, but at the same time it had to be ac- \nknowledged that the theorists are often one- \nsided, and therefore one should not trust them \nabsolutely, but should also listen to what Pfuel's \nopponents and practical men of experience in \nwarfare had to say, and then choose a middle \ncourse. They insisted on the retention of the \ncamp at Drissa, according to Pfuel's plan, but \non changing the movements of the other ar- \nmies. Though, by this course, neither one aim \nnor the other could be attained, yet it seemed \nbest to the adherents of this third party. \n\nOf a fourth opinion the most conspicuous \nrepresentative was the Tsar^vich, who could \nnot forget his disillusionment at Austerlitz, \nwhere he had ridden out at the head of the \nGuards, in his casque and cavalry uniform as to \na review, expecting to crush the French gal- \nlantly; but unexpectedly finding himself in the \nfront line had narrowly escaped amid the gen- \neral confusion. The men of this party had both \nthe quality and the defect of frankness in their \nopinions. They feared Napoleon, recognized \nhis strength and their own weakness, and frank- \nly said so. They said: "Nothing but sorrow, \nshame, and ruin will come of all this! We have \nabandoned Vilna and Vitebsk and shall aban- \ndon Drissa. The only reasonable thing left to \ndo is to conclude peace as soon as possible, be- \nfore we are turned out of Petersburg.'* \n\nThis view was very general in the upper ar- \nmy circles and found support also in Peters- \nburg and from the chancellor, Rumydntsev, \nwho, for other reasons of state, was in favor of \npeace. \n\nThe fifth party consisted of those who were \nadherents of Barclay de Tolly, not so much as \na man but as minister of war and commander \nin chief. "Be he what he may" (they always be- \ngan like that), "he is an honest, practical man \nand we have nobody better. Give him real \npower, for war cannot be conducted success- \nfully without unity of command, and he will \nshow what he can do, as he did in Finland. \nIf our army is well organized and strong \nand has withdrawn to Drissa without suffer- \ning any defeats, we owe this entirely to Bar- \nclay. If Barclay is now to be superseded by \nBennigsen all will be lost, for Bennigsen \n\n\n\nshowed his incapacity already in 1807." \n\nThe sixth party, the Bennigsenites, said, on \nthe contrary, that at any rate there was no one \nmore active and experienced than Bennigsen: \n"and twist about as you may, you will have to \ncome to Bennigsen eventually. Let the others \nmake mistakes now ! " said they, arguing that our \nretirement to Drissa was a most shameful re- \nverse and an unbroken series of blunders. "The \nmore mistakes that are made the better. It will \nat any rate be understood all the sooner that \nthings cannot go on like this. What is wanted \nis not some Barclay or other, but a man like \nBennigsen, who made his mark in 1807, and to \nwhom Napoleon himself did justice a man \nwhose authority would be willingly recognized, \nand Bennigsen is the only such man." \n\nThe seventh party consisted of the sort of \npeople who are always to be found, especially \naround young sovereigns, and of whom there \nwere particularly many round Alexander gen- \nerals and imperial aides-de-camp passionately \ndevoted to the Emperor, not merely as a mon- \narch but as a man, adoring him sincerely and \ndisinterestedly, as Rost6v had done in 1805, \nand who saw in him not only all the virtues \nbut all human capabilities as well. These men, \nthough enchanted with the sovereign for refus- \ning the command of the army, yet blamed him \nfor such excessive modesty, and only desired \nand insisted that their adored sovereign should \nabandon his diffidence and openly announce \nthat he would place himself at the head of the \narmy, gather round him a commander in chiefs \nstaff, and, consulting experienced theoreticians \nand practical men where necessary, would him- \nself lead the troops, whose spirits would there- \nby be raised to the highest pitch. \n\nThe eighth and largest group, which in its \nenormous numbers was to the others as ninety- \nnine to one, consisted of men who desired nei- \nther peace nor war, neither an advance nor a \ndefensive camp at the Drissa or anywhere else, \nneither Barclay nor the Emperor, neither Pfuel \nnor Bennigsen, but only the one most essential \nthing as much advantage and pleasure for \nthemselves as possible. In the troubled waters \nof conflicting and intersecting intrigues that \neddied about the Emperor's headquarters, it \nwas possible to succeed in many ways unthink- \nable at other times. A man who simply wished \nto retain his lucrative post would today agree \nwith Pfuel, tomorrow with his opponent, and \nthe day after, merely to avoid responsibility or \nto please the Emperor, would declare that he \nhad no opinion at all on the matter. Another \n\n\n\nBOOK \n\nwho wished to gain some advantage would &amp;- \ntract the Emperor's attention by loudly acfvo- \ncating the very thing the Emperor had hinted \nat the day before, and would dispute and shout \nat the council, beating his breast and challeng- \ning those who did not agree with him to duels, \nthereby proving that he was prepared to sac- \nrifice himself for the common good. A third, \nin the absence of opponents, between two coun- \ncils would simply solicit a Special gratuity for \nhis faithful services, well knowing that at that \nmoment people would be too busy to refuse \nhim. A fourth while seemingly overwhelmed \nwith work would often come accidentally un- \nder the Emperor's eye. A fifth, to achieve his \nlong-cherished aim of dining with the Emper- \nor, would stubbornly insist on the correctness \nor falsity of some newly emerging opinion and \nfor this object would produce arguments more \nor less forcible and correct. \n\nAll the men of this party were fishing for \nrubles, decorations, and promotions, and in \nthis pursuit watched only the weathercock of \nimperial favor, and directly they noticed it \nturning in any direction, this whole drone pop- \nulation of the army began blowing hard that \nway, so that it was all the harder for the Em- \nperor to turn it elsewhere. Amid the uncer- \ntainties of the position, with the menace of \nserious danger giving a peculiarly threaten- \ning character to everything, amid this vortex of \nintrigue, egotism, conflict of views and feelings, \nand the diversity of race among these people- \ntins eighth and largest party of those preoccu- \npied with personal interests imparted great \nconfusion and obscurity to the common task. \nWhatever question arose, a swarm of these \ndrones, without having finished their buzzing \non a previous theme, flew over to the new one \nand by their hum drowned and obscured the \nvoices of those who were disputing honestly. \n\nFrom among all these parties, just at the \ntime Prince Andrew reached the army, another, \na ninth party, was being formed and was be- \nginning to raise its voice. This was the party of \nthe elders, reasonable men experienced and \ncapable in state affairs, who, without sharing \nany of those conflicting opinions, were able to \ntake a detached view of what was gong on at \nthe staff at headquarters and to consider means \nof escape from this muddle, indecision, intrica- \ncy, and weakness. \n\nThe men of this party said and thought that \nwhat was wrong resulted chiefly from the Em- \nperor's presence in the army with his military \ncourt and from the consequent presence there \n\n\n\nNINE 361 \n\nof a-n indefinite, conditional, and unsteady fluc- \ntuation of relations, which is in place at court \nbut harmful in an army; that a sovereign should \nreign but not command the army, and that the \nonly way out of the position would be for the \nEmperor and his court to leave the army; that \nthe mere presence of the Emperor paralyzed \nthe action of fifty thousand men required to \nsecure his personal safety, and that the worst \ncommander in chief if independent would be \nbetter than the very best one trammeled by the \npresence and authority of the monarch. \n\nJust at the time Prince Andrew was living \nunoccupied at Drissa, Shishk6v, the Secretary \nof State and one of the chief representatives of \nthis party, wrote a letter to the Emperor which \nArakche"ev and Balashev agreed to sign. In this \nletter, availing himself of permission given \nhim by the Emperor to discuss the general \ncourse of affairs, he respectfully suggested on \nthe plea that it was necessary for the sovereign \nto arouse a warlike spirit in the people of \nthe capital that the Emperor should leave the \narmy. \n\nThat arousing of the people by their sov- \nereign and his call to them to defend their \ncountry the very incitement which was the \nchief cause of Russia's triumph in so far as it \nwas produced by the Tsar's personal presence \nin Moscow was suggested to the Emperor, and \naccepted by him, as a pretext for quitting the \narmy. \n\nCHAPTER X \n\nTHIS LETTER had not yet been presented to the \nEmperor when Barclay, one day at dinner, in- \nformed Bolk6nski that the sovereign wished to \nsee him personally, to question him about \nTurkey, and that Prince Andrew was to pre- \nsent himself at Bennigsen's quarters at six that \nevening. \n\nNews was received at the Emperor's quarters \nthat very day of a fresh movement by Napo- \nleon which might endanger the army news \nsubsequently found to be false. And that morn- \ning Colonel Michaud had ridden round the \nDrissa fortifications with the Emperor and had \npointed out to him that this fortified camp \nconstructed by Pfuel, and till then considered \na chef-d'oeuvre of tactical science which would \nensure Napoleon's destruction, was an absurd- \nity, threatening the destruction of the Russian \narmy. \n\nPrince Andrew arrived at Bennigsen's quar- \ntersa country gentleman's house of moderate \nsize, situated on the very banks of the river, \n\n\n\n36* WAR AND PEACE \n\nNeither Bennigsen nor the Emperor was there, \nbut Chernyshev, the Emperor's aide-de-camp, \nreceived Bolk6nski and informed him that the \nEmperor, accompanied by General Bennigsen \nand Marquis Paulucci, had gone a second time \nthat day to inspect the fortifications of the \nDrissa camp, of the suitability of which serious \ndoubts were beginning to be felt. \n\nChernyshev was sitting at a window in the \nfirst room with a French novel in his hand. \nThis room had probably been a music room; \nthere was still an organ in it on which some \nrugs were piled, and in one corner stood the \nfolding Bedstead of Bennigsen's adjutant. This \nadjutant was also there and sat dozing on the \nrolled-up bedding, evidently exhausted by work \nor by feasting. Two doors led from the room, \none straight on into what had been the draw- \ning room, and another, on the right, to the \nstudy. Through the first door came the sound \nof voices con versing in German and occasional- \nly in French. In that drawing room were gath- \nered, by the Emperor's wish, not a military \ncouncil (the Emperor preferred indefinite- \nness), but certain persons whose opinions he \nwished to know in view of the impending dif- \nficulties. It was not a council of war, but, as it \nwere, a council to elucidate certain questions \nfor the Emperor personally. To this semicoun- \ncil had been invited the Swedish General Arm- \nfeldt, Adjutant General Wolzogen, Wintzinge- \nrode (whom Napoleon had referred to as a \nrenegade French subject), Michaud, Toll, \nCount Stein who was not a military man at all, \nand Pfuel himself, who, as Prince Andrew had \nheard, was the mainspring of the whole affair. \nPrince Andrew had an opportunity of getting \na good look at him, for Pfuel arrived soon after \nhimself and, in passing through to the draw- \ning room, stopped a minute to speak to Cher- \nnyshev. \n\nAt first sight, Pfuel, in his ill-made uniform \nof a Russian general, which fitted him badly \nlike a fancy costume, seemed familiar to Prince \nAndrew, though he saw him now for the first \ntime. There was about him something of Wey- \nrother, Mack, and Schmidt, and many other \nGerman theorist-generals whom Prince An- \ndrew had seen in 1805, but he was more typical \nthan any of them. Prince Andrew had never \nyet teen a German theorist in whom all the \ncharacteristics of those others were united to \nsuch an extent. \n\nPfuel was short and very thin but broad- \nboned, o! coarse, robust build, broad in the \nhips, and with prominent shoulder blades. His \n\n\n\nface was much wrinkled and his eyes deep set. \nHis hair had evidently been hastily brushed \nsmooth in front of the temples, but stuck up \nbehind in quaint little tufts. He entered the \nroom, looking restlessly and angrily around, \nas if afraid of everything in that large apart- \nment. Awkwardly holding up his sword, he ad- \ndressed Chernyshev and asked in German \nwhere the Emperor was. One could see that he \nwished to pass through the rooms as quickly as \npossible, finish with the bows and greetings, \nand sit down to business in front of a map, \nwhere he would feel at home. He nodded hur- \nriedly in reply to Chernyshev, and smiled iron- \nically on hearing that the sovereign was in- \nspecting the fortifications that he, Pfuel, had \nplanned in accord with his theory. He muttered \nsomething to himself abruptly and in a bass \nvoice, as self-assured Germans doit might \nhave been "stupid fellow" ... or "the whole \naffair will be ruined," or "something absurd \nwill come of it." . . . Prince Andrew did not \ncatch what he said and would have passed on, \nbut Chernyshev introduced him to Pfuel, re- \nmarking that Prince Andrew was just back \nfrom Turkey where the war had terminated so \nfortunately. Pfuel barely glanced not so much \nat Prince Andrew as past him and said, with \na laugh: "That must have been a fine tactical \nwar"; and, laughing contemptuously, went on \ninto the room from which the sound of voices \nwas heard. \n\nPfuel, always inclined to be irritably sarcas- \ntic, was particularly disturbed that day, evi- \ndently by the fact that they had dared to in- \nspect and criticize his camp in his absence. \nFrom this short interview with Pfuel, Prince \nAndrew, thanks to his Austerlitz experiences, \nwas able to form a clear conception of the man. \nPfuel was one of those hopelessly and immu- \ntably self-confident men, self-confident to the \npoint of martyrdom as only Germans are, be- \ncause only Germans are self-confident on the \nbasis of an abstract notion science, that is, the \nsupposed knowledge of absolute truth. A \nFrenchman is self-assured because he regards \nhimself personally, both in mind and body, as \nirresistibly attractive to men and women. An \nEnglishman is self-assured, as being a citizen \nof the best-organized state in the world, and \ntherefore as an Englishman always knows what \nhe should do and knows that all he does as an \nEnglishman is undoubtedly correct. An Italian \nis self-assured because he is excitable and easily \nforgets himself and other people. A Russian is \nself-assured just because he knows nothing and \n\n\n\nBOOK \n\ndoes not want to know anything, since he does \nnot believe that anything can be known. The \nGerman's self-assurance is worst of all, stronger \nand more repulsive than any other, because he \nimagines that he knows the truthscience \nwhich he himself has invented but which is for \nhim the absolute truth. \n\nPfuel was evidently of that sort. He had a \nscience the theory of oblique movements de- \nduced by him from the history of Frederick \nthe Great's wars, and all he came across in the \nhistory of more recent warfare seemed to him \nabsurd and barbarous monstrous collisions in \nwhich so many blunders were committed by \nboth sides that these wars could not be called \nwars, they did not accord with the theory, and \ntherefore could not serve as material for science. \n\nIn 1806 Pfuel had been one of those respon- \nsible for the plan of campaign that ended in \nJena and Auerstadt, but he did not see the \nleast proof of the fallibility of his theory in the \ndisasters of that war. On the contrary, the de- \nviations made from his theory were, in his \nopinion, the sole cause of the whole disaster, \nand with characteristically gleeful sarcasm he \nwould remark, "There, I said the whole affair \nwould go to the devil!" Pfuel was one of those \ntheoreticians who so love their theory that they \nlose sight of the theory's object its practical \napplication. His love of theory made him hate \neverything practical, and he would not listen \nto it. He was even pleased by failures, for fail- \nures resulting from deviations in practice from \nthe theory only proved to him the accuracy of \nhis theory. \n\nHe said a few words to Prince Andrew and \nChernyshev about the present war, with the \nair of a man who knows beforehand that all \nwill go wrong, and who is not displeased that \nit should be so. The unbrushed tufts of hair \nsticking up behind and the hastily brushed \nhair on his temples expressed this most elo- \nquently. \n\nHe passed into the next room, and the deep, \nquerulous sounds of his voice were at once \nheard from there. \n\nCHAPTER XI \n\nPRINCE ANDREW'S eyes were still following Pfuel \nout of the room when Count Bennigsen en- \ntered hurriedly, and nodding to Bolk6nski, \nbut not pausing, went into the study, giving \ninstructions to his adjutant as he went. The \nEmperor was following him, and Bennigsen \nhad hastened on to make some preparations, \nand to be ready to receive the sovereign. Cher- \n\n\n\nNINE 363 \n\nnyshev and Prince Andrew went out into the \nporch, where the Emperor, who looked fa- \ntigued, was dismounting. Marquis Paulucci \nwas talking to him with particular warmth and \nthe Emperor, with his head bent to the left, \nwas listening with a dissatisfied air. The Em- \nperor moved forward evidently wishing to end \nthe conversation, but the flushed and excited \nItalian, oblivious of decorum, followed him \nand continued to speak. \n\n"And as for the man who advised forming \nthis camp the Drissa camp," said Paulucci, as \nthe Emperor mounted the steps and noticing \nPrince Andrew scanned his unfamiliar face, \n"as to that person, sire . . ." continued Pauluc- \nci, desperately, apparently unable to restrain \nhimself, "the man who advised the Drissa camp \nI see no alternative but the lunatic asylum or \nthe gallows!" \n\nWithout heeding the end of the Italian's re- \nmarks, and as though not hearing them, the \nEmperor, recognizing Bolk6nski, addressed him \ngraciously. \n\n"I am very glad to see you! Go in there \nwhere they are meeting, and wait for me." \n\nThe Emperor went into the study. He was \nfollowed by Prince Peter Mikhaylovich Vol- \nk6nski and Baron Stein, and the door closed \nbehind them. Prince Andrew, taking advan- \ntage of the Emperor's permission, accompanied \nPaulucci, whom he had known in Turkey, in- \nto the drawing room where the council was as- \nsembled. \n\nPrince Peter Mikhdylovich Volk6nski occu- \npied the position, as it were, of chief of the \nEmperor's staff. He came out of the study into \nthe drawing room with some maps which he \nspread on a table, and put questions on which \nhe wished to hear the opinion of the gentle- \nmen present. What had happened was that \nnews (which afterwards proved to be false) \nhad been received during the night of a move- \nment by the French to outflank the Drissa \ncamp. \n\nThe first to speak was General Armfeldt \nwho, to meet the difficulty that presented it- \nself, unexpectedly proposed a perfectly new \nposition away from the Petersburg and Mos- \ncow roads. The reason for this was inexplicable \n(unless he wished to show that he, too, could \nhave an opinion), but he urged that at this \npoint the army should unite and there await \nthe enemy. It was plain that Armfeldt had \nthought out that plan long ago and now ex- \n. pounded it not so much to answer the ques- \ntions putwhich, in fact, his plan did not an- \n\n\n\n364 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nswer as to avail himself of the opportunity to \nair it. It was one of the millions of proposals, \none as good as another, that could be made as \nlong as it was quite unknown what character \nthe war would take. Some disputed his argu- \nments, others defended them. Young Count \nToll objected to the Swedish general's views \nmore warmly than anyone else, and in the \ncourse of the dispute drew from his side pocket \na well-filled notebook, which he asked permis- \nsion to read to them. In these voluminous notes \nToll suggested another scheme, totally differ- \nent from Armfeldt's or Pfuel's plan of cam- \npaign. In answer to Toll, Paulucci suggested \nan advance and an attack, which, he urged, \ncould alone extricate us from the present un- \ncertainty and from the trap (as he called the \nDrissa camp) in which we were situated. \n\nDuring all these discussions Pfuel and his \ninterpreter, Wolzogen (his "bridge" in court \nrelations), were silent. Pfuel only snorted con- \ntemptuously and turned away, to show that he \nwould never demean himself by replying to \nsuch nonsense as he was now hearing. So when \nPrince Volk6nski, who was in the chair, called \non him to give his opinion, he merely said: \n\n"Why ask me? General Armfeldt has pro- \nposed a splendid position with an exposed \nrear, or why not this Italian gentleman's at- \ntackvery fine, or a retreat, also goodl Why \nask me?" said he. "Why, you yourselves know \neverything better than I do." \n\nBut when Volk6nski said, with a frown, that \nit was in the Emperor's name that he asked his \nopinion, Pfuel rose and, suddenly growing ani- \nmated, began to speak: \n\n"Everything has been spoiled, everything \nmuddled, everybody thought they knew better \nthan I did, and now you come to me! How \nmend matters? There is nothing to mend! The \nprinciples laid down by me must be strictly ad- \nhered to," said he, drumming on the tablewith \nhis bony fingers. "What is the difficulty? Non- \nsense, childishness!" \n\nHe went up to the map and speaking rapid- \nly began proving that no eventuality could al- \nter the efficiency of the Drissa camp, that every- \nthing had been foreseen, and that if the enemy \nwere really going to outflank it, the enemy \nwould inevitably be destroyed. \n\nPaulucci, who did not know German, began \nquestioning him in French. Wolzogen came to \nthe assistance of his chief, who spoke French \nbadly, and began translating for him, hardly \nable to keep pace with Pfuel, who was rapidly \ndemonstrating that not only all that had hap- \n\n\n\npened, but all that could happen, had been \nforeseen in his scheme, and that if there were \nnow any difficulties the whole fault lay in the \nfact that his plan had not been precisely exe- \ncuted. He kept laughing sarcastically, he dem- \nonstrated, and at last contemptuously ceased \nto demonstrate, like a mathematician who \nceases to prove in various ways the accuracy of \na problem that has already been proved. Wol- \nzogen took his place and continued to explain \nhis views in French, every now and then turn- \ning to Pfuel and saying, "Is it not so, your ex- \ncellency?" But Pfuel, like a man heated in a \nfight who strikes those on his own side, shouted \nangrily at his own supporter, Wolzogen: \n\n"Well, of course, what more is there to ex- \nplain?" \n\nPaulucci and Michaud both attacked Wol- \n/ogen simultaneously in French. Armfeldt ad- \ndressed Pfuel in German. Toll explained to \nVolkonski in Russian. Prince Andrew listened \nand observed in silence. \n\nOf all these men Prince Andrew sympathized \nmost with Pfuel, angry, determined, and ab- \nsurdly self-confident as he was. Of all those \npresent, evidently he alone was not seeking \nanything for himself, nursed no hatred against \nanyone, and only desired that the plan, formed \non a theory arrived at by years of toil, should be \ncarried out. He was ridiculous, and unpleasant- \nly sarcastic, but yet he inspired involuntary re- \nspect by his boundless devotion to an idea. Be- \nsides this, the remarks of all except Pfuel had \none common trait that had not been noticeable \nat the council of war in 1805: there was now a \npanic fear of Napoleon's genius, which, though \nconcealed, was noticeable in every rejoinder. \nEverything was assumed to be possible for Na- \npoleon, they expected him from every side, \nand invoked his terrible name to shatter each \nother's proposals. Pfuel alone seemed to con- \nsider Napoleon a barbarian like everyone else \nwho opposed his theory. But besides this feel- \ning of respect, Pfuel evoked pity in Prince An- \ndrew. From the tone in which the courtiers \naddressed him and the way Paulucci had al- \nlowed himself to speak of him to the Emperor, \nbut above all from a certain desperation in \nPfuel's own expressions, it was clear that the \nothers knew, and Pfuel himself felt, that his \nfall was at hand. And despite his self-confi- \ndence and grumpy German sarcasm he was \npitiable, with his hair smoothly brushed on the \ntemples and sticking up in tufts behind. \nThough he concealed the fact under a show of \nirritation and contempt, he was evidently in \n\n\n\nBOOK NINE \n\n\n\n365 \n\n\n\ndespair that the sole remaining chance of veri- \nfying his theory by a huge experiment and \nproving its soundness to the whole world was \nslipping away from him. \n\nThe discussions continued a long time, and \nthe longer they lasted the more heated became \nthe disputes, culminating in shouts and per- \nsonalities, and the less was it possible to arrive \nat any general conclusion from all that had \nbeen said. Prince Andrew, listening to this \npolyglot talk and to these surmises, plans, ref- \nutations, and shouts, felt nothing but amaze- \nment at what they were saying. A thought that \nhad long since and often occurred to him dur- \ning his military activitiesthe idea that there \nis not and cannot be any science of war, and \nthat therefore there can be no such thing as a \nmilitary genius now appeared to him an ob- \nvious truth. "What theory and science is possi- \nble about a matter the conditions and circum- \nstances of which are unknown and cannot be \ndefined, especially when the strength of the \nacting forces cannot be ascertained? No one \nwas or is able to foresee in what condition our \nor the enemy's armies will be in a day's time, \nand no one can gauge the force of this or that \ndetachment. Sometimes when there is not a \ncoward at the front to shout, 'We are cut off!' \nand start running, but a brave and jolly lad \nwho shouts, 'Hurrah!' a detachment of five \nthousand is worth thirty thousand, as at Schon \nGrabern, while at times fifty thousand run \nfrom eight thousand, as at Austerlitz. What \nscience can there be in a matter in which, as in \nall practical matters, nothing can be defined \nand everything depends on innumerable con- \nditions, the significance of which is determined \nat a particular moment which arrives no one \nknows when? Armfeldt says our army is cut in \nhalf, and Paulucci says we have got the French \narmy between two fires; Michaud says that the \nworthlessness of the Drissa camp lies in having \nthe river behind it, and Pfuel says that is what \nconstitutes its strength; Toll proposes one \nplan, Armfeldt another, and they are all good \nand all bad, and the advantages of any sugges- \ntions can be seen only at the moment of trial. \nAnd why do they all speak of a 'military gen- \nius'? Is a man a genius who can order bread to \nbe brought up at the right time and say who \nis to go to the right and who to the left? It is \nonly because military men are invested with \npomp and power and crowds of sychophants \nflatter power, attributing to it qualities of gen- \nius it does not possess. The best generals I \nhave known were, on the contrary, stupid or \n\n\n\nabsent-minded men. Bagrati6n was the best, \nNapoleon himself admitted that. And Bona- \nparte himself 1 I remember his limited, self- \nsatisfied face on the field of Austerlitz. Not on- \nly does a good army commander not need any \nspecial qualities, on the contrary he needs the \nabsence of the highest and best human attri- \nbuteslove, poetry, tenderness, and philosoph- \nic inquiring doubt. He should be limited, \nfirmly convinced that what he is doing is very \nimportant (otherwise he will not have sufficient \npatience), and only then will he be a brave lead- \ner. God forbid that he should be humane, should \nlove, or pity, or think of what is just and un- \njust. It is understandable that a theory of their \n'genius' was invented for them long ago be- \ncause they have power! The success of a mili- \ntary action depends not on them, but on the \nman in the ranks who shouts, 'We are lostl' or \nwho shouts, 'Hurrahl' And only in the ranks \ncan one serve with assurance of being useful." \n\nSo thought Prince Andrew as he listened to \nthe talking, and he roused himself only when \nPaulucci called him and everyone was leaving. \n\nAt the review next day the Emperor asked \nPrince Andrew where he would like to serve, \nand Prince Andrew lost his standing in court \ncircles forever by not asking to remrfin attached \nto the sovereign's person, but for permission to \nserve in the army. \n\nCHAPTER XII \n\nBEFORE THE BEGINNING of the campaign, Ros- \nt6v had received a letter from his parents in \nwhich they told him briefly of Natdsha's illness \nand the breaking off of her engagement to \nPrince Andrew (which they explained by Na- \ntdsha's having rejected him) and again asked \nNicholas to retire from the army and return \nhome. On receiving this letter, Nicholas did \nnot even make any attempt to get leave of ab- \nsence or to retire from the army, but wrote to \nhis parents that he was sorry Natasha was ill \nand her engagement broken off, and that he \nwould do all he could to meet their wishes. \nTo S6nya he wrote separately. \n\n"Adored friend of my soul! "he wrote. "Noth- \ning but honor could keep me from returning \nto the country. But now, at the commence- \nment of the campaign, I should feel dishon- \nored, not only in my comrades' eyes but in my \nown, if I preferred my own happiness to my \nlove and duty to the Fatherland. But this shall \nbe our last separation. Believe me, directly \nthe war is over, if I am still alive and still loved \nby you, I will throw up everything and fly to \n\n\n\n366 \n\nyou, to press you forever to my ardent breast." \n\nIt was, in fact, only the commencement of \nthe campaign that prevented Rost6v from re- \nturning home as he had promised and marry- \ning S6nya. The autumn in Otradnoe with the \nhunting, and the winter with the Christmas \nholidays and Sonya's love, had opened out to \nhim a vista of tranquil rural joys and peace \nsuch as he had never known before, and which \nnow allured him. "A splendid wife, children, a \ngood pack of hcunds, a dozen leashes of smart \nborzois, agriculture, neighbors, service by elec- \ntion . . ." thought he. But now the campaign \nwas beginning, and he had to remain with his \nregiment. And since it had to be so, Nicholas \nRost6v, as was natural to him, felt contented \nwith the life he led in the regiment and was \nable to find pleasure in that life. \n\nOn his return from his furlough Nicholas, \nhaving been joyfully welcomed by his com- \nrades, was sent to obtain remounts and brought \nback from the Ukraine excellent horses which \npleased him and earned him commendation \nfrom his commanders. During his absence he \nhad been promoted captain, and when the \nregiment was put on war footing with an in- \ncrease in numbers, he was again allotted his \nold squadrbn. \n\nThe campaign began, the regiment was \nmoved into Poland on double pay, new of- \nficers arrived, new men and horses, and above \nall everybody was infected with the merrily ex- \ncited mood that goes with the commencement \nof a war, and Rostov, conscious of his advan- \ntageous position in the regiment, devoted him- \nself entirely to the pleasures and interests of \nmilitary service, though he knew that sooner \nor later he would have to relinquish them. \n\nThe troops retired from Vilna for various \ncomplicated reasons of state, political and \nstrategic. Each step of the retreat was accom- \npanied by a complicated interplay of interests, \narguments, and passions at headquarters. For \nthe Pavlograd hussars, however, the whole of \nthis retreat during the finest period of summer \nand with sufficient supplies was a very simple \nand agreeable business. \n\nIt was only at headquarters that there was \ndepression, uneasiness, and intriguing; in the \nbody of the army they did not ask themselves \nwhere they were going or why. If they regretted \nhaving to retreat^, it was only because they had \nto leave billets they had grown accustomed to, \nor some pretty young Polish lady. If the \nthought that things looked bad chanced to en- \nter anyone's head, he tried to be as cheerful as \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nbefits a good soldier and not to think of the \ngeneral trend of affairs, but only of the task \nnearest to hand. First they camped gaily be- \nfore Vilna, making acquaintance with the \nPolish landowners, preparing for reviews and \nbeing reviewed by the Emperor and other high \ncommanders. Then came an order to retreat to \nSventsyani and destroy any provisions they \ncould not carry away with them. Sventsyani \nwas remembered by the hussars only as the \ndrunken camp, a name the whole army gave to \ntheir encampment there, and because many \ncomplaints were made against the troops, who, \ntaking advantage of the order to collect provi- \nsions, took also horses, carriages, and carpets \nfrom the Polish proprietors. Rostov remem- \nbered Sventsydni, because on the first day of \ntheir arrival at that small town he changed his \nsergeant major and was unable to manage all \nthe drunken men of his squadron who, un- \nknown to him, had appropriated five barrels \nof old beer. From Sventsyani they retired far- \nther and farther to Drissa, and thence again \nbeyond Drissa, drawing near to the frontier of \nRussia proper. \n\nOn the thirteenth of July the Pdvlograds \ntook part in a serious action for the first time. \n\nOn the twelfth of July, on the eve of that \naction, there was a heavy storm of rain and \nhail. In general, the summer of 1812 was re- \nmarkable for its storms. \n\nThe two Pdvlograd squadrons were bivouack- \ning on a field of rye, which was already in ear \nbut had been completely trodden down by \ncattle and horses. The rain was descending in \ntorrents, and Rostov, with a young officer \nnamed Ilyfn, his protg, was sitting in a hasti- \nly constructed shelter. An officer of their regi- \nment, with long mustaches extending onto his \ncheeks, who after riding to the staff had been \novertaken by the rain, entered Rost6v'ssheltcr. \n\n"I have come from the staff, Count. Have \nyou heard of Ra^vski's exploit?" \n\nAnd the officer gave them details of the Sal- \ntanov battle, which he had heard at the staff. \n\nRostov, smoking his pipe and turning his \nhead about as the water trickled down his \nneck, listened inattentively, with an occasional \nglance at Ilyfn, who was pressing close to him. \nThis officer, a lad of sixteen who had recently \njoined the regiment, was now in the same rela- \ntion to Nicholas that Nicholas had been to \nDenfsov seven years before. Ilyin tried to imi- \ntate Rost6v in everything and adored him as \na girl might have done. \n\nZdrzhinski, the officer with the long mus- \n\n\n\nBOOK NINE \n\n\n\ntache, spoke grandiloquently of the Saltanov \ndam being "a Russian Thermopylae," and of \nhow a deed worthy of antiquity had been per- \nformed by General Ravski. He recounted how \nRae* vski had led his two sons onto the dam un- \nder terrific fire and had charged with them be- \nside him. Rost6v heard the story and not only \nsaid nothing to encourage Zdrzhinski's enthu- \nsiasm but, on the contrary, looked like a man \nashamed of what he was hearing, though with \nno intention of contradicting it. Since the cam- \npaigns of Austerlitz and of 1807 Rost6v knew \nby experience that men always lie when de- \nscribing military exploits, as he himself had \ndone when recounting them; besides that, he \nhad experience enough to know that nothing \nhappens in war at all as we can imagine or re- \nlate it. And so he did not like Zdrzhinski's tale, \nnor did he like Zdrzhinski himself who, with \nhis mustaches extending over his cheeks, bent \nlow over the face of his hearer, as was his habit, \nand crowded Rost6v in the narrow shanty. \nRost6v looked at him in silence. "In the first \nplace, there must have been such a confusion \nand crowding on the dam that was being at- \ntacked that if Rae*vski did lead his sons there, \nit could have had no effect except perhaps on \nsome dozen men nearest to him/' thought he, \n"the rest could not have seen how or with \nwhom Radvski came onto the dam. And even \nthose who did see it would not have been \nmuch stimulated by it, for what had they to do \nwith Ravski's tender paternal feelings when \ntheir own skins were in danger? And besides, \nthe fate of the Fatherland did not depend on \nwhether they took the Saltdnov dam or not, as \nwe are told was the case at Thermopylae. So \nwhy should he have made such a sacrifice? And \nwhy expose his own children in the battle? I \nwould not have taken my brother Pe*tya there, \nor even Ilyin, who's a stranger to me but a nice \nlad, but would have tried to put them some- \nwhere under cover," Nicholas continued to \nthink, as he listened to Zdrzhinski. But he did \nnot express his thoughts, for in such matters, \ntoo, he had gained experience. He knew that \nthis tale redounded to the glory of our arms \nand so one had to pretend not to doubt it. And \nhe acted accordingly. \n\n"I can't stand this any more," said Ilyfn, no- \nticing that Rost6v did not relish Zdrzhinski's \nconversation. "My stockings and shirt . . . and \nthe water is running on my seatl I'll go and \nlook for shelter. The rain seems less heavy." \n\nIlyfn went out and Zdrzhinski rode away. \n\nFive minutes later Ilyfn, splashing through \n\n\n\n567 \n\nthe mud, came running back to the shanty. \n\n"Hurrah! Rostov, come quick! I've found it! \nAbout two hundred yards away there's a tavern \nwhere ours have already gathered. We can at \nleast get dry there, and Mary Hendrfkhovna's \nthere." \n\nMary Hendrfkhovna was the wife of the regi- \nmental doctor, a pretty young German woman \nhe had married in Poland. The doctor, wheth- \ner from lack of means or because he did not \nlike to part from his young wife in the early \ndays of their marriage, took her about with \nhim wherever the hussar regiment went and \nhis jealousy had become a standing joke among \nthe hussar officers. \n\nRost6v threw his cloak over his shoulders, \nshouted to Lavriishka to follow with the things, \nand now slipping in the mud, now splashing \nright through it set off with Ilyfn in the les- \nsening rain and the darkness that was occa- \nsionally rent by distant lightning. \n\n"Rost6v, where are you?" \n\n"Here. What lightning!" they called to one \nanother. \n\nCHAPTER XIII \n\nIN THE TAVERN, before which stood the doctor's \ncovered cart, there were already some five of- \nficers. Mary Hendrfkhovna, a plump little \nblonde German, in a dressing jacket and night- \ncap, was sitting on a broad bench in the front \ncorner. Her husband, the doctor, lay asleep be- \nhind her. Rost6v and Ilyfn, on entering the \nroom, were welcomed with merry shouts and \nlaughter. \n\n"Dear me, how jolly we are!" said Rost6v \nlaughing. \n\n"And why do you stand there gaping?" \n\n"What swells they are! Why, the water \nstreams from them! Don't make our drawing \nroom so wet." \n\n"Don't mess Mary Hendrikhovna's dress!" \ncried other voices. \n\nRostov and Ilyfn hastened to find a corner \nwhere they could change into dry clothes \nwithout offending Mary Hendrfkhovna's \nmodesty. They were going into a tiny recess \nbehind a partition to change, but found \nit completely filled by three officers who sat \nplaying cards by the light of a solitary candle \non an empty box, and these officers would \non no account yield their position. Mary \nHendrfkhovna obliged them with the loan \nof a petticoat to be used as a curtain, and be- \nhind that screen Rost6v and Ilyfn, helped \nby Lavriishka who had brought their kit*. \n\n\n\n368 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nchanged their wet things for dry ones. \n\nA fire was made up in the dilapidated brick \nstove. A board was found, fixed on two saddles \nand covered with a horsecloth, a small samovar \nwas produced and a cellaret and half a bottle \nof rum, and having asked Mary Hendrfkhovna \nto preside, they all crowded round her. One of- \nfered her a clean handkerchief to wipe her \ncharming hands, another spread a jacket un- \nder her little feet to keep them from the damp, \nanother hung his coat over the window to keep \nout the draft, and yet another waved the flics \noff her husband's face, lest he should wake up. \n\n"Leave him alone," said Mary Hendrikhov- \nna, smiling timidly and happily. "He is sleep- \ning well as it is, after a sleepless night." \n\n"Oh, no, Mary Hendrikhovna," replied the \nofficer, "one must look after the doctor. Per- \nhaps he'll take pity on me someday, when it \ncomes to cutting off a leg or an arm for me." \n\nThere were only three tumblers, the water \nwas so muddy that one could not make out \nwhether the tea was strong or weak, and the \nsamovar held only six tumblers of water, but \nthis made it all the pleasanter to take turns in \norder of seniority to receive one's tumbler from \nMary Hendrikhovna's plump little hands with \ntheir short and not overclean nails. All the of- \nficers appeared to be, and really were, in love \nwith her that evening. Even those playing \ncards behind the partition soon left their game \nand came over to the samovar, yielding to the \ngeneral mood of courting Mary Hendrikhov- \nna. She, seeing herself surrounded by such \nbrilliant and polite young men, beamed with \nsatisfaction, try as she might to hide it, and \nperturbed as she evidently was each time her \nhusband moved in his sleep behind her. \n\nThere was only one spoon, sugar was more \nplentiful than anything else, but it took too \nlong to dissolve, so it was decided that Mary \nHendrikhovna should stir the sugar for every- \none in turn. Rost6v received his tumbler, and \nadding some rum to it asked Mary Hendrik- \nhovna to stir it. \n\n"But you take it without sugar?" she said, \nsmiling all the time, as if everything she said \nand everything the others said was very amus- \ning and had a double meaning. \n\n"It is not the sugar I want, but only that \nyour little hand should stir my tea." \n\nMary Hendrikhovna assented and began \nlooking for the spoon which someone mean- \nwhile had pounced on. \n\n"Use your finger, Mary Hendrfkhovna, it \nwill be still nicer," said Rost6v. \n\n\n\n"Too hotl" she replied, blushing with pleas- \nure. \n\nIlyin put a few drops of rum into the bucket \nof water and brought it to Mary Hendrikhov- \nna, asking her to stir it with her finger. \n\n"This is my cup," said he. "Only dip your \nfinger in it and I'll drink it all up." \n\nWhen they had emptied the samovar, Ros- \nt6v took a pack of cards and proposed that \nthey should play "Kings" with Mary Hendrik- \nhovna. They drew lots to settle who should \nmake up her set. At Rost6v's suggestion it was \nagreed that whoever became "King" should \nhave the right to kiss Mary Hendrikhovna's \nhand, and that the "Booby" should go to refill \nand reheat the samovar for the doctor when \nthe latter awoke. \n\n"Well, but supposing Mary Hendrfkhovna \nis 'King'?" asked Ilyin. \n\n"As it is, she is Queen, and her word is law!" \n\nThey had hardly begun to play before the \ndoctor's disheveled head suddenly appeared \nfrom behind Mary Hendrikhovna. He had \nbeen awake for some time, listening to what \nwas being said, and evidently found nothing \nentertaining or amusing in what was going on. \nHis face was sad and depressed. Without greet- \ning the officers, he scratched himself and asked \nto be allowed to pass as they were blocking the \nway. As soon as he had left the room all the of- \nficers burst into loud laughter and Mary Hen- \ndrikhovna blushed till her eyes filled with tears \nand thereby became still more attractive to \nthem. Returning from the yard, the doctor \ntold his wife (who had ceased to smile so hap- \npily, and looked at him in alarm, awaiting her \nsentence) that the rain had ceased and they \nmust go to sleep in their covered cart, or every- \nthing in it would be stolen. \n\n"But I'll send an orderly Two of them!" \n\nsaid Rost6v. "What an idea, doctorl" \n\n"I'll stand guard on it myself!" said Ilyin. \n\n"No, gentlemen, you have had your sleep, \nbut I have not slept for two nights," replied \nthe doctor, and he sat down morosely beside \nhis wife, waiting for the game to end. \n\nSeeing his gloomy face as he frowned at his \nwife, the officers grew still merrier, and some \nof them could not refrain from laughter, for \nwhich they hurriedly sought plausible pre- \ntexts. When he had gone, taking his wife with \nhim, and had settled down with her in their \ncovered cart, the officers lay down in the tavern, \ncovering themselves with their wet cloaks, but \nthey did not sleep for a long time; now they \nexchanged remarks, recalling the doctor's un- \n\n\n\nBOOK \n\neasiness and his wife's delight, now they ran \nout into the porch and reported what was tak- \ning place in the covered trap. Several times \nRost6v, covering his head, tried to go to sleep, \nbut some remark would arouse him and con- \nversation would be resumed, to the accom- \npaniment of unreasoning, merry, childlike \nlaughter. \n\nCHAPTER XIV \n\nIT WAS nearly three o'clock but no one was yet \nasleep, when the quartermaster appeared with \nan order to move on to the little town of Os- \ntr6vna. Still laughing and talking, the officers \nbegan hurriedly getting ready and again boiled \nsome muddy water in the samovar. But Ros- \nt6v went off to his squadron without waiting \nfor tea. Day was breaking, the rain had ceased, \narid the clouds were dispersing. It felt damp \nand cold, especially in clothes that were still \nmoist. As they left the tavern in the twilight of \nthe dawn, Rost6v and Ilyin both glanced un- \nder the wet and glistening leather hood of the \ndoctor's cart, from under the apron of which \nhis feet were sticking out, and in the middle of \nwhich his wife's nightcap was visible and her \nsleepy breathing audible. \n\n"She really is a dear little thing," said Ros- \nt6v to Ilyin, who was following him. \n\n"A charming woman!" said Ilyin, with all \nthe gravity of a boy of sixteen. \n\nHalf an hour later the squadron was lined \nup on the road. The command was heard to \n"mount" and the soldiers crossed themselves \nand mounted. Rostov riding in front gave the \norder "Forward!" and the hussars, with clank- \ning sabers and subdued talk, their horses' \nhoofs splashing in the mud, defiled in fours \nand moved along the broad road planted \nwith birch trees on each side, following the \ninfantry and a battery that had gone on in \nfront. \n\nTattered, blue-purple clouds, reddening in \nthe east, were scudding before the wind. It was \ngrowing lighter and lighter. That curly grass \nwhich always grows by country roadsides be- \ncame clearly visible, still wet with the night's \nrain; the drooping branches of the birches, al- \nso wet, swayed in the wind and flung down \nbright drops of water to one side. The soldiers' \nfaces were more and more clearly visible. Ros- \nt6v, always closely followed by Ilyin, rode \nalong the side of the road between two rows of \nbirch trees. \n\nWhen campaigning, Rost6v allowed himself \nthe indulgence of riding not a regimental but \n\n\n\nNINE \n\n\n\n3 6 9 \n\n\n\na Cossack horse. A judge of horses and a sports- \nman, he had lately procured himself a large, \nfine, mettlesome, Done*ts horse, dun-colored, \nwith light mane and tail, and when he rode it \nno one could outgallop him. To ride this horse \nwas a pleasure to him, and he thought of the \nhorse, of the morning, of the doctor's wife, but \nnot once of the impending danger. \n\nFormerly, when going into action, Rost6v \nhad felt afraid; now he had not the least feel- \ning of fear. He was fearless, not because he had \ngrown used to being under fire (one cannot \ngrow used to danger), but because he had \nlearned how to manage his thoughts when in \ndanger. He had grown accustomed when go- \ning into action to think about anything but \nwhat would seem most likely to interest him \nthe impending danger. During the first period \nof his service, hard as he tried and much as he \nreproached himself with cowardice, he had not \nbeen able to do this, but with time it had come \nof itself. Now he rode beside Ilyin under the \nbirch trees, occasionally plucking leaves from \na branch that met his hand, sometimes touch- \ning his horse's side with his foot, or, without \nturning round, handing a pipe he had finished \nto an hussar riding behind him, with as calm \nand careless an air as though he were merely \nout for a ride. He glanced with pity at the ex- \ncited face of Ilyin, who talked much and in \ngreat agitation. He knew from experience the \ntormenting expectation of terror and death \nthe cornet was suffering and knew that only \ntime could help him. \n\nAs soon as the sun appeared in a clear strip \nof sky beneath the clouds, the wind fell, as if \nit dared not spoil the beauty of the summer \nmorning after the storm; drops still continued \nto fall, but vertically now, and all was still. \nThe whole sun appeared on the horizon and \ndisappeared behind a long narrow cloud that \nhung above it. A few minutes later it reap- \npeared brighter still from behind the top of \nthe cloud, tearing its edge. Everything grew \nbright and glittered. And with that light, and \nas if in reply to it, came the sound of guns \nahead of them. \n\nBefore Rostov had had time to consider and \ndetermine the distance of that firing, Count \nOstermann-Tolstoy's adjutant came galloping \nfrom Vitebsk with orders to advance at a trot \nalong the road. \n\nThe squadron overtook and passed the in- \nfantry and the battery which had also quick- \nened their pace rode down a hill, and passing \nthrough an empty and deserted village again \n\n\n\n37 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nascended. The horses began to lather and the \nmen to flush. \n\n"Haiti Dress your ranks!" the order of the \nregimental commander was heard ahead. "For- \nward by the left. Walk, march!" came the or- \nder from in front. \n\nAnd the hussars, passing along the line of \ntroops on the left flank of our position, halted \nbehind our Uhlans who were in the front line. \nTo the right stood our infantry in a dense \ncolumn: they were the reserve. Higher up the \nhill, on the very horizon, our guns were visible \nthrough the wonderfully clear air, brightly \nilluminated by slanting morn ing sunbeams. In \nfront, beyond a hollow dale, could be seen the \nenemy's columns and guns. Our advanced line, \nalready in action, could be heard briskly ex- \nchanging shots with the enemy in the dale. \n\nAt these sounds, long unheard, Rost6v's \nspirits rose, as at the strains of the merriest \nmusic. Trap-ta-ta-tap! cracked the shots, now \ntogether, now several quickly one after anoth- \ner. Again all was silent and then again it \nsounded as if someone were walking on deto- \nnators and exploding them. \n\nThe hussars remained in the same place for \nabout an hour. A cannonade began. Count \nOstermann with his suite rode up behind the \nsquadron, halted, spoke to the commander of \nthe regiment, and rode up the hill to the guns. \n\nAfter Ostermann had gone, a command rang \nout to the Uhlans. \n\n"Form column! Prepare to charge!" \n\nThe infantry in front of them parted into \nplatoons to allow the cavalry to pass. The Uh- \nlans started, the streamers on their spears flut- \ntering, and trotted downhill toward the French \ncavalry which was seen below to the left. \n\nAs soon as the Uhlans descended the hill, \nthe hussars were ordered up the hill to support \nthe battery. As they took the places vacated by \nthe Uhlans, bullets came from the front, whin- \ning and whistling, but fell spent without tak- \ning effect. \n\nThe sounds, which he had not heard for so \nlong, had an even more pleasurable and ex- \nhilarating effect on Rost6v than the previous \nsounds of firing. Drawing himself up, he viewed \nthe field of battle opening out before him from \nthe hill, and with his whole soul followed the \nmovement of the Uhlans. They swooped down \ndose to the French dragoons, something con- \ntused happened there amid the smoke, and \nfive minutes later our Uhlans were galloping \nback, not to the place they had occupied but \nmore to the left, and among the orange-colored \n\n\n\nUhlans on chestnut horses and behind them, \nin a large group, blue French dragoons on gray \nhorses could be seen. \n\nCHAPTER XV \n\nROSTOV, with his keen sportsman's eye, was \none of the first to catch sight of these blue \nFrench dragoons pursuing our Uhlans. Nearer \nand nearer in disorderly crowds came the Uh- \nlans and the French dragoons pursuing them. \nHe could already see how these men, who \nlooked so small at the foot of the hill, jostled \nand overtook one another, waving their arms \nand their sabers in the air. \n\nRost6v gazed at what was happening before \nhim as at a hunt. He felt instinctively that if \nthe hussars struck at the French dragoons now, \nthe latter could not withstand them, but if a \ncharge was to be made it must be done now, at \nthat very moment, or it would be too late. He \nlooked around. A captain, standing beside him, \nwas gazing like himself with eyes fixed on the \ncavalry below them. \n\n"Andrew Sevastyinychl" said Rost6v. "You \nknow, we could crush them " \n\n"A fine thing tool" replied the captain, "and \nreally . . ." \n\nRost6v, without waiting to hear him out, \ntouched his horse, galloped to the front of his \nsquadron, and before he had time to finish \ngiving the word of command, the whole squad- \nron, sharing his feeling, was following him. \nRost6v himself did not know how or why he \ndid it. He acted as he did when hunting, with- \nout reflecting or considering. He saw the dra- \ngoons near and that they were galloping in dis- \norder; he knew they could not withstand an \nattack knew there was only that moment and \nthat if he let it slip it would not return. The \nbullets were whining and whistling so stimu- \nlatingly around him and his horse was so eager \nto go that he could not restrain himself. He \ntouched his horse, gave the word of command, \nand immediately, hearing behind him the \ntramp of the horses of his deployed squadron, \nrode at full trot downhill toward the dragoons. \nHardly had they reached the bottom of the hill \nbefore their pace instinctively changed to a \ngallop, which grew faster and faster as they \ndrew nearer to our Uhlans and the French \ndragoons who galloped after them. The dra- \ngoons were now close at hand. On seeing the \nhussars, the foremost began to turn, while \nthose behind began to halt. With the same \nfeeling with which he had galloped across the \npath of a wolf, Rost6v gave rein to his Done* ts \n\n\n\nBOOK NINE \n\n\n\nhorse and galloped to intersect the path of the \ndragoons' disordered lines. One Uhlan stopped, \nanother who was on foot flung himself to the \nground to avoid being knocked over, and a \nriderless horse fell in among the hussars. Near- \nly all the French dragoons were galloping back. \nRost6v, picking out one on a gray horse, dashed \nafter him. On the way he came upon a bush, \nhis gallant horse cleared it, and almost before \nhe had righted himself in his saddle he saw \nthat he would immediately overtake the en- \nemy he had selected. That Frenchman, by his \nuniform an officer, was going at a gallop, \ncrouching on his gray horse and urging it on \nwith his saber. In another moment Rost6v's \nhorse dashed its breast against the hindquarters \nof the officer's horse, almost knocking it over, \nand at the same instant Rost6v, without know- \ning why, raised his saber and struck the French- \nman with it. \n\nThe instant he had done this, all Rost6v's \nanimation vanished. The officer fell, not so \nmuch from the blowwhich had but slightly \ncut his arm above the elbow as from the \nshock to his horse and from fright. Rost6v \nreined in his horse, and his eyes sought his foe \nto see whom he had vanquished. The French \ndragoon officer was hopping with one foot on \nthe ground, the other being caught in the stir- \nrup. His eyes, screwed up with fear as if he \nevery moment expected another blow, gazed \nup at Rost6v with shrinking terror. His pale \nand mud-stained face fair and young, with a \ndimple in the chin and light-blue eyes was \nnot an enemy's face at all suited to a battlefield, \nbut a most ordinary, homelike face. Before \nRost6v had decided what to do with him, the \nofficer cried, "I surrenderl" He hurriedly but \nvainly tried to get his foot out of the stirrup \nand did not remove his frightened blue eyes \nfrom Rost6v's face. Some hussars who galloped \nup disengaged his foot and helped him into \nthe saddle. On all sides, the hussars were busy \nwith the dragoons; one was wounded, but \nthough his face was bleeding, he would not \ngive up his horse; another was perched up be- \nhind an hussar with his arms round him; a \nthird was being helped by an hussar to mount \nhis horse. In front, the French infantry were \nfiring as they ran. The hussars galloped hastily \nback with their prisoners. Rost6v galloped back \nwith the rest, aware of an unpleasant feeling \nof depression in his heart. Something vague \nand confused, which he could not at all ac- \ncount for, had come over him with the capture \nof that officer and the blow he had dealt him. \n\n\n\nCount Ostermann-Tolst6y met the return- \ning hussars, sent for Rostov, thanked him, and \nsaid he would report his gallant deed to the \nEmperor and would recommend him for a St. \nGeorge's Cross. When sent for by Count Oster- \nmann, Rost6v, remembering that he had \ncharged without orders, felt sure his command- \ner was sending for him to punish him for \nbreach of discipline. Ostermann's flattering \nwords and promise of a reward should there- \nfore have struck him all the more pleasantly, \nbut he still felt that same vaguely disagreeable \nfeeling of moral nausea. "But what on earth is \nworrying me?" he asked himself as he rode \nback from the general. "Ilyfn? No, he's safe. \nHave I disgraced myself in any way? No, that's \nnot it." Something else, resembling remorse, \ntormented him. "Yes, oh yes, that French of- \nficer with the dimple. And I remember how \nmy arm paused when I raised it." \n\nRost6v saw the prisoners being led away and \ngalloped after them to have a look at his \nFrenchman with the dimple on his chin. He \nwas sitting in his foreign uniform on an hussar \npackhorse and looked anxiously about him. \nThe sword cut on his arm could scarcely be \ncalled a wound. He glanced at Rost6v with a \nfeigned smile and waved his hand in greeting. \nRost6v still had the same indefinite feeling, as \nof shame. \n\nAll that day and the next his friends and \ncomrades noticed that Rost6v, without being \ndull or angry, was silent, thoughtful, and pre- \noccupied. He drank reluctantly, tried to re- \nmain alone, and kept turning something over \nin his mind. \n\nRostov was always thinking about that bril- \nliant exploit of his, which to his amazement \nhad gained him the St. George's Cross and even \ngiven him a reputation for bravery, and there \nwas something he could not at all understand. \n"So others are even more afraid than I ami" \nhe thought. "So that's all there is in what is \ncalled heroism I And did I do it for my country's \nsake? And how was he to blame, with his dim- \nple and blue eyes? And how frightened he wasl \nHe thought that I should kill him. Why should \nI kill him? My hand trembled. And they have \ngiven me a St. George's Cross. ... I can't make \nit out at all." \n\nBut while Nicholas was considering these \nquestions and still could reach no clear solu- \ntion of what puzzled him so, the wheel of for- \ntune in the service, as often happens, turned \nin his favor. After the affair at Ostr6vna he \nwas brought into notice, received command of \n\n\n\n37* \n\nan hussar battalion, and when a brave officer \n\nwas needed he was chosen. \n\nCHAPTER XVI \n\nON RECEIVING NEWS of Natdsha's illness, the \ncountess, though not quite well yet and still \nweak, went to Moscow with Pdtya and the \nrest of the household, and the whole family \nmoved from Marya Dmftrievna's house to their \nown and settled down in town. \n\nNatdsha's illness was so serious that, fortu- \nnately for her and for her parents, the consider- \nation of all that had caused the illness, her \nconduct and the breaking off of her engage- \nment, receded into the background. She was \nso ill that it was impossible for them to consid- \ner in how far she was to blame for what had \nhappened. She could not eat or sleep, grew \nvisibly thinner, coughed, and, as the doctors \nmade them feel, was in danger. They could not \nthink of anything but how to help her. Doctors \ncame to see her singly and in consultation, \ntalked much in French, German, and Latin, \nblamed one another, and prescribed a great \nvariety of medicines for all the diseases known \nto them, but the simple idea never occurred \nto any of them that they could not know the \ndisease Natasha was suffering from, as no dis- \nease suffered by a live man can be known, for \nevery living person has his own peculiarities \nand always has his own peculiar, personal, nov- \nel, complicated disease, unknown to medicine \nnot a disease of the lungs, liver, skin, heart, \nnerves, and so on mentioned in medical books, \nbut a disease consisting of one of the innumer- \nable combinations of the maladies of those or- \ngans. This simple thought could not occur to \nthe doctors (as it cannot occur to a wizard that \nhe is unable to work his charms) because the \nbusiness of their lives was to cure, and they re- \nceived money for it and had spent the best \nyears of their lives on that business. But, above \nall, that thought was kept out of their minds \nby the fact that they saw they were really use- \nful, as in fact they were to the whole Rost6v \nfamily. Their usefulness did not depend on \nmaking the patient swallow substances for the \nmost part harmful (the harm was scarcely per- \nceptible, as they were given in small doses), \nbut they were useful, necessary, and indispen- \nsable because they satisfied a mental need of \nthe invalid and of those who loved her and \nthat is why there are, and always will be, \npseudo-healers, wise women, homeopaths, and \nallopaths. They satisfied that eternal human \nneed for hope of relief, for sympathy, and that \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\nsomething should be done, which is felt by \nthose who are suffering. They satisfied the need \nseen in its most elementary form in a child, \nwhen it wants to have a place rubbed that has \nbeen hurt. A child knocks itself and runs at \nonce to the arms of its mother or nurse to have \nthe aching spot rubbed or kissed, and it feels \nbetter when this is done. The child cannot \nbelieve that the strongest and wisest of its peo- \nple have no remedy for its pain, and the hope \nof relief and the expression of its mother's \nsympathy while she rubs the bump comforts it. \nThe doctors were of use to Natdsha because \nthey kissed and rubbed her bump, assuring \nher that it would soon pass if only the coach- \nman went to the chemist's in the Arbdt and \ngot a powder and some pills in a pretty box for \na ruble and seventy kopeks, and if she took \nthose powders in boiled water at intervals of \nprecisely two hours, neither more nor less. \n\nWhat would S6nya and the count and count- \ness have done, how would they have looked, if \nnothing had been done, if there had not been \nthose pills to give by the clock, the warm drinks, \nthe chicken cutlets, and all the other details of \nlife ordered by the doctors, the carrying out of \nwhich supplied an occupation and consola- \ntion to the family circle? How would the count \nhave borne his clearly loved daughter's illness \nhad he not known that it was costing him a \nthousand rubles, and that he would not grudge \nthousands more to benefit her, or had he not \nknown that if her illness continued he would \nnot grudge yet other thousands and would take \nher abroad for consultations there, and had he \nnot been able to explain the details of howMe"- \ntivier and Feller had not understood the symp- \ntoms, but Frise had, and Miidrov had diag- \nnosed them even better? What would the \ncountess have done had she not been able \nsometimes to scold the invalid for not strictly \nobeying the doctor's orders? \n\n"You'll never get well like that," she would \nsay, forgetting her grief in her vexation, "if \nyou won't obey the doctor and take your medi- \ncine at the right time! You mustn't trifle with \nit, you know, or it may turn to pneumonia!' \nshe would go on, deriving much comfort from \nthe utterance of that foreign word, incompre- \nhensible to others as well as to herself. \n\nWhat would S6nya have done without the \nglad consciousness that she had not undressed \nduring the first three nights, in order to be \nready to carry out all the doctor's injunctions \nwith precision, and that she still kept awake at \nnight so as not to miss the proper time when \n\n\n\nBOOK NINE \n\n\n\n373 \n\n\n\nthe slightly harmful pills in the little gilt box \nhad to be administered? Even to Natasha her- \nself it was pleasant to see that so many sacri- \nfices were being made for her sake, and to know \nthat she had to take medicine at certain hours, \nthough she declared that no medicine would \ncure her and that it was all nonsense. And it was \neven pleasant to be able to show, by disregard- \ning the orders, that she did not believe in medi- \ncal treatment and did not value her life. \n\nThe doctor came every day, felt her pulse, \nlooked at her tongue, and regardless of her \ngrief-stricken face joked with her. But when \nhe had gone into another room, to which the \ncountess hurriedly followed him, he assumed \na grave air and thoughtfully shaking his head \nsaid that though there was danger, he had \nhopes of the effect of this last medicine and \none must wait and see, that the malady was \nchiefly mental, but . . . And the countess, try- \ning to conceal the action from herself and from \nhim, slipped a gold coin into his hand and al- \nways returned to the patient with a more tran- \nquil mind. \n\nThe symptoms of Natdsha's illness were that \nshe ate little, slept little, coughed, and was al- \nways low-spirited. The doctors said that she \ncould not get on without medical treatment, so \nthey kept her in the stifling atmosphere of the \ntown, and the Rostovs did riot move to the \ncountry that summer of 1812. \n\nIn spite of the many pills she swallowed and \nthe drops and powders out of the little bottles \nand boxes of which Madame Schoss who was \nfond of such things made a large collection, and \nin spite of being deprived of the country life to \nwhich she was accustomed, youth prevailed. \nNatdsha's grief began to be overlaid by the \nimpressions of daily life, it ceased to press so \npainfully on her heart, it gradually faded into \nthe past, and she began to recover physically. \n\nCHAPTER XVII \n\nNATASHA WAS CALMER but no happier. She not \nmerely avoided all external forms of pleasure \nballs, promenades, concerts, and theaters \nbut she never laughed without a sound of tears \nin her laughter. She could not sing. As soon as \nshe began to laugh, or tried to sing by herself, \ntears choked her: tears of remorse, tears at the \nrecollection of those pure times which could \nnever return, tears of vexation that she should \nso uselessly have ruined her young life which \nmight have been so happy. Laughter and sing- \ning in particular seemed to her like a blas- \nphemy, in face of her sorrow. Without any \n\n\n\nneed of self-restraint, no wish to coquet ever \nentered her head. She said and felt at that time \nthat no man was more to her than Nastisya \nIvdnovna, the buffoon. Something stood senti- \nnel within her and forbade her every joy. Be- \nsides, she had lost all the old interests of her \ncarefree girlish life that had been so full of hope. \nThe previous autumn, the hunting, "Uncle," \nand the Christmas holidays spent with Nicho- \nlas at Otrddnoe were what she recalled often- \nest and most painfully. What would she not \nhave given to bring back even a single day of \nthat timel But it was gone forever. Her pre- \nsentiment at the time had not deceived her \nthat that state of freedom and readiness for \nany enjoyment would not return again. Yet it \nwas necessary to live on. \n\nIt comforted her to reflect that she was not \nbetter as she had formerly imagined, but worse, \nmuch worse, than anybody else in the world. \nBut this was not enough. She knew that, and \nasked herself, "What next?" But there was \nnothing to come. There was no joy in life, yet \nlife was passing. Natasha apparently tried not \nto be a burden or a hindrance to anyone, but \nwanted nothing for herself. She kept away \nfrom everyone in the house and felt at ease on- \nly with her brother Ptya. She liked to be with \nhim better than with the others, and when \nalone with him she sometimes laughed. She \nhardly ever left the house and of those who \ncame to see them was glad to see only one per- \nson, Pierre. It would have been impossible to \ntreat her with more delicacy, greater care, and \nat the same time more seriously than did Count \nBezukhov. Natdsha unconsciously felt this del- \nicacy and so found great pleasure in his society. \nBut she was not even grateful to him for it; \nnothing good on Pierre's part seemed to her to \nbe an effort, it seemed so natural for him to be \nkind to everyone that there was no merit in \nhis kindness. Sometimes Natdsha noticed em- \nbarrassment and awkwardness on his part in \nher presence, especially when he wanted to do \nsomething to please her, or feared that some- \nthing they spoke of would awaken memories \ndistressing to her. She noticed this and attrib- \nuted it to his general kindness and shyness, \nwhich she imagined must be the same toward \neveryone as it was to her. After those involun- \ntary words that if he were free he would have \nasked on his knees for her hand and her love- \nuttered at a moment when she was so strongly \nagitated, Pierre never spoke to Natdsha of his \nfeelings; and it seemed plain to her that those \nwords, which had then so comforted her, were \n\n\n\n374 \n\n\n\nspoken as all sorts of meaningless words are \nspoken to comfort a crying child. It was not be- \ncause Pierre was a married man, but because \nNatasha felt very strongly with him that moral \nbarrier the absence of which she had experi- \nenced with Kuragin that it never entered her \nhead that the relations between him and her- \nself could lead to love on her part, still less \non his, or even to the kind of tender, self- \nconscious, romantic friendship between a \nman and a woman of which she had known \nseveral instances. \n\nBefore the end of the fast of St. Peter, Agra- \nfna Ivdnovna Belova, a country neighbor of \nthe Rostovs, came to Moscow to pay her devo- \ntions at the shrines of the Moscow saints. She \nsuggested that Natdsha should fast and pre- \npare for Holy Communion, and Natasha glad- \nly welcomed the idea. Despite the doctor's or- \nders that she should not go out early in the \nmorning, Natasha insisted on fasting and pre- \nparing for the sacrament, not as they generally \nprepared for it in the Rostov family by attend- \ning three services in their own house, but as \nAgrafe"na Ivdnovna did, by going to church \nevery day for a week and not once missing \nVespers, Matins, or Mass. \n\nThe countess was pleased with Natasha's \nzeal; after the poor results of the medical treat- \nment, in the depths of her heart she hoped that \nprayer might help her daughter more than \nmedicines and, though not without fear and \nconcealing it from the doctor, she agreed to \nNatasha's wish and entrusted her to Belova. \nAgrafcna Ivanovna used to come to wake Na- \ntasha at three in the morning, but generally \nfound her already awake. She was afraid of be- \ning late for Matins. Hastily washing, and meek- \nly putting on her shabbiest dress and an old \nmantilla, Natasha, shivering in the fresh air, \nwent out into the deserted streets lit by the \nclear light of dawn. By Agraf^na Ivanovna's \nadvice Natasha prepared herself not in their \nown parish, but at a church where, according \nto the devout Agratena Ivanovna, the priest \nwas a man of very severe and lofty life. There \nwere never many people in the church; Nata- \nsha always stood beside Belova in the customary \nplace before an icon of the Blessed Virgin, let \ninto the screen before the choir on the left \nside, and a feeling, new to her, of humility be- \nfore something great and incomprehensible, \nseized her when at that unusual morning hour, \ngazing at the dark face of the Virgin illumi- \nnated by the candles burning before it and by \nthe morning light falling from the window, \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\nshe listened to the words of the service which \nshe tried to follow with understanding. When \nshe understood them her personal feeling be- \ncame interwoven in the prayers with shades of \nits own. When she did not understand, it was \nsweeter still to think that the wish to under- \nstand everything is pride, that it is impossible \nto understand all, that it is only necessary to \nbelieve and to commit oneself to God, whom \nshe felt guiding her soul at those moments. She \ncrossed herself, bowed low, and when she did \nnot understand, in horror at her own vileness, \nsimply asked God to forgive her everything, \neverything, and to have mercy upon her. The \nprayers to which she surrendered herself most \nof all were those of repentance. On her way \nhome at an early hour when she met no one \nbut bricklayers going to work or men sweeping \nthe street, and everybody within the houses was \nstill asleep, Natdsha experienced a feeling new \nto her, a sense of the possibility of correcting \nher faults, the possibility of a new, clean life, \nand of happiness. \n\nDuring the whole week she spent in this \nway, that feeling grew every day. And the hap- \npiness of taking communion, or "communing" \nas Agrafe"na Ivdnovna, joyously playing with \nthe word, called it, seemed to Natasha so great \nthat she felt she should never live till that \nblessed Sunday. \n\nBut the happy day came, and on that memo- \nrable Sunday, when, dressed in white muslin, \nshe returned home after communion, for the \nfirst time for many months she felt calm and \nnot oppressed by the thought of the life that \nlay before her. \n\nThe doctor who came to see her that day or- \ndered her to continue the powders he had pre- \nscribed a fortnight previously. \n\n"She must certainly go on taking them morn- \ning and evening," said he, evidently sincerely \nsatisfied with his success. "Only, please be par- \nticular about it. \n\n"Be quite easy," he continued playfully, as \nhe adroitly took the gold coin in his palm. \n"She will soon be singing and frolicking about. \nThe last medicine has done her a very great \ndeal of good. She has freshened up very much." \n\nThe countess, with a cheerful expression on \nher face, looked down at her nails and spat a \nlittle for luck as she returned to the drawing \nroom. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII \n\nAT THE BEGINNING of July more and more dis- \nquieting reports about the war began to spread \n\n\n\nBOOK NINE \n\n\n\nin Moscow; people spoke of an appeal by the \nEmperor to the people, and of his coming him- \nself from the army to Moscow. And as up to the \neleventh of July no manifesto or appeal had \nbeen received, exaggerated reports became \ncurrent about them and about the position of \nRussia. It was said that the Emperor was leav- \ning the army because it was in danger, it was \nsaid that Smolensk had surrendered, that Na- \npoleon had an army of a million and only a \nmiracle could save Russia. \n\nOn the eleventh of July, which was Satur- \nday, the manifesto was received but was not \nyet in print, and Pierre, who was at the Ros- \ntovs', promised to come to dinner next day, \nSunday, and bring a copy of the manifesto and \nappeal, which he would obtain from Count \nRostopchin. \n\nThat Sunday, the Rost6vs went to Mass at \nthe RazurruVvskis' private chapel as usual. It \nwas a hot July day. Even at ten o'clock, when \nthe Rostovs got out of their carriage at the \nchapel, the sultry air, the shouts of hawkers, \nthe light and gay summer clothes of the crowd, \nthe dusty leaves of the trees on the boulevard, \nthe sounds of the band and the white trousers \nof a battalion marching to parade, the rattling \nof wheels on the cobblestones, and the brilliant, \nhot sunshine were all full of that summer lan- \nguor, that content and discontent with the pres- \nent, which is most strongly felt on a bright, hot \nday in town. All the Moscow notabilities, all \nthe Rost6vs' acquaintances, were at the Razu- \nm6vskis' chapel, for, as if expecting something \nto happen, many wealthy families who usually \nleft town for their country estates had not \ngone away that summer. As Natasha, at her \nmother's side, passed through the crowd be- \nhind a liveried footman who cleared the way \nfor them, she heard a young man speaking about \nher in too loud a whisper. \n\n"That's Rostova, the one who ..." \n\n"She's much thinner, but all the same she's \nprettyl" \n\nShe heard, or thought she heard, the names \nof Kuragin and Bolk6nski. But she was always \nimagining that. It always seemed to her that \neveryone who looked at her was thinking only \nof what had happened to her. With a sinking \nheart, wretched as she always was now when \nshe found herself in a crowd, Natasha in her \nlilac silk dress trimmed with black lace walked \nas women can walkwith the more repose \nand stateliness the greater the pain and shame \nin her soul. She knew for certain that she was \npretty, but this no longer gave her satisfaction \n\n\n\n375 \n\n\n\nas it used to. On the contrary it tormented her \nmore than anything else of late, and particular- \nly so on this bright, hot summer day in town. \n"It's Sunday again another week past," she \nthought, recalling that she had been here the \nSunday before, "and always the same life that \nis no life, and the same surroundings in which \nit used to be so easy to live. I'm pretty, 1'myoung, \nand I know that now I am good. I used to be \nbad, but now I know I am good," she thought, \n"but yet my best years are slipping by and are \nno good to anyone." She stood by her mother's \nside and exchanged nods with acquaintances \nnear her. From habit she scrutinized the ladies' \ndresses, condemned the bearing of a lady stand- \ning close by who was not crossing herself prop- \nerly but in a cramped manner, and again she \nthought with vexation that she was herself be- \ning judged and was judging others, and sud- \ndenly, at the sound of the service, she felt hor- \nrified at her own vileness, horrified that the \nformer purity of her soul was again lost to her. \n\nA comely, fresh-looking old man was con- \nducting the service with that mild solemnity \nwhich has so elevating and soothing an effect \non the souls of the worshipers. The gates of the \nsanctuary screen were closed, the curtain was \nslowly drawn, and from behind it a soft myste- \nrious voice pronounced some words. Tears, the \ncause of which she herself did not understand, \nmade Natdsha's breast heave, and a joyous but \noppressive feeling agitated her. \n\n"Teach me what I should do, how to live my \nlife, how I may grow good forever, forever!" \nshe pleaded. \n\nThe deacon came out onto the raised space \nbefore the altar screen and, holding his thumb \nextended, drew his long hair from under his \ndalmatic and, making the sign of the cross on \nhis breast, began in a loud and solemn voice to \nrecite the words of the prayer. . . . \n\n"In peace let us pray unto the Lord." \n\n"As one community, without distinction of \nclass, without enmity, united by brotherly love \nlet us prayl" thought Natasha. \n\n"For the peace that is from above, and for \nthe salvation of our souls." \n\n"For the world of angels and all the spirits \nwho dwell above us," prayed Natdsha. \n\nWhen they prayed for the warriors, she \nthought of her brother and Denisov. When \nthey prayed for all traveling by land and sea, \nshe remembered Prince Andrew, prayed for \nhim, and asked God to forgive her all the \nwrongs she had done him. When they prayed \nfor those who love us, she prayed for the mem- \n\n\n\n376 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nbers of her own family, her father and mother \nand Sonya, realizing for the first time how \nwrongly she had acted toward them, and feel- \ning all the strength of her love for them. When \nthey prayed for those who hate us, she tried to \nthink of her enemies and people who hated \nher, in order to pray for them. She included \namong her enemies the creditors and all who \nhad business dealings with her father, and al- \nways at the thought of enemies and those who \nhated her she remembered Anatole who had \ndone her so much harmand though he did \nnot hate her she gladly prayed for him as for \nan enemy. Only at prayer did she feel able to \nthink clearly and calmly of Prince Andrew and \nAnatole, as men for whom her feelings were as \nnothing compared with her awe and devotion \nto God. When they prayed for the Imperial \nfamily and the Synod, she bowed very low and \nmade the sign of the cross, saying to herself that \neven if she did not understand, still she could \nnot doubt, and at any rate loved the govern- \ning Synod and prayed for it. \n\nWhen he had finished the Litany the deacon \ncrossed the stole over his breast and said, "Let \nus commit ourselves and our whole lives to \nChrist the Lord!" \n\n"Commit ourselves to God," Natdsha in- \nwardly repeated. "Lord God, I submit myself \nto Thy willl" she thought. "I want nothing, \nwish for nothing; teach me what to do and \nhow to use my willl Take me, take mel" prayed \nNatasha, with impatient emotion in her heart, \nnot crossing herself but letting her slender arms \nhang down as if expecting some invisible pow- \ner at any moment to take her and deliver her \nfrom herself, from her regrets, desires, remorse, \nhopes, and sins. \n\nThe countess looked round several times at \nher daughter's softened face and shining eyes \nand prayed God to help her. \n\nUnexpectedly, in the middle of the service, \nand not in the usual order Natasha knew so \nwell, the deacon brought out a small stool, the \none he knelt on when praying on Trinity Sun- \nday, and placed it before the doors of the sanc- \ntuary screen. The priest came out with his pur- \nple velvet biretta on his head, adjusted his \nhair, and knelt down with an effort. Every- \nbody followed his example and they looked at \none another in surprise. Then came the prayer \njust received from the Synod a prayer for the \ndeliverance of Russia from hostile invasion. \n\n"Lord God of might, God of our salvation!" \nbegan the priest in that voice, clear, not gran- \ndiloquent but mild, in which only the Slav \n\n\n\nclergy read and which acts so irresistibly on a \nRussian heart. \n\n"Lord God of might, God of our salvation! \nLook this day in mercy and blessing on Thy \nhumble people, and graciously hear us, spare \nus, and have mercy upon us! This foe con- \nfounding Thy land, desiring to lay waste the \nwholeworld, rises against us; these lawless men \nare gathered together to overthrow Thy king- \ndom, to destroy Thy dear Jerusalem, Thy be- \nloved Russia; to defile Thy temples, to over- \nthrow Thine altars, and to desecrate our \nholy shrines. How long, O Lord, how long \nshall the wicked triumph? How long shall they \nwield unlawful power? \n\n"Lord God! Hear us when we pray to Thee; \nstrengthen with Thy might our most gracious \nsovereign lord, the Emperor Alexander Pdvlo- \nvich; be mindful of his uprightness and meek- \nness, reward him according tohis righteousness, \nand let it preserve us, Thy chosen Israel! Bless \nhis counsels, his undertakings, and his work; \nstrengthen his kingdom by Thine almighty \nhand, and give him victory over his enemy, \neven as Thou gavest Moses the victory over \nAmalek, Gideon over Midian, and David over \nGoliath. Preserve his army, put a bow of brass \nin the hands of those who have armed them- \nselves in Thy Name, and gird their loins with \nstrength for the fight. Take up the spear and \nshield and arise to help us; confound and put \nto shame those who have devised evil against \nus, may they be before the faces of Thy faith- \nful warriors as dust before the wind, and may \nThy mighty Angel confound them and put \nthem to flight; may they be ensnared when they \nknow it not, and may the plots they have laid \nin secret be turned against them; let them fall \nbefore Thy servants' feet and be laid low by \nour hosts! Lord, Thou art able to save both \ngreat and small; Thou art God, and man can- \nnot prevail against Thee! \n\n"God of our fathers! Remember Thy boun- \nteous mercy and loving-kindness which are \nfrom of old; turn not Thy face from us, but \nbe gracious to our unworthiness, and in Thy \ngreat goodness and Thy many mercies regard \nnot our transgressions and iniquities! Create \nin us a clean heart and renew a right spirit \nwithin us, strengthen us all in Thy faith, forti- \nfy our hope, inspire us with true love one for \nanother, arm us with unity of spirit in the \nrighteous defense of the heritage Thou gavest \nto us and to our fathers, and let not the scepter \nof the wicked be exalted against the destiny of \nthose Thou hast sanctified. \n\n\n\nBOOK NINE \n\n\n\n377 \n\n\n\n"O Lord our God, in whom we believe and \nin whom we put our trust, let us not be con- \nfounded in our hope of Thy mercy, and give \nus a token of Thy blessing, that those who hate \nus and our Orthodox faith may see it and be \nput to shame and perish, and may all the na- \ntions know that Thou art the Lord and we are \nThy people. Show Thy mercy upon us this day, \nO Lord, and grant us Thy salvation; make the \nhearts of Thy servants to rejoice in Thy mercy; \nsmite down our enemies and destroy them \nswiftly beneath the feet of Thy faithful serv- \nants! For Thou art the defense, the succor, and \nthe victory of them that put their trust in Thee, \nand to Thee be all glory, to Father, Son, and \nHoly Ghost, now and forever, world without \nend. Amen." \n\nIn Natasha's receptive condition of soul this \nprayer affected her strongly. She listened to ev- \nery word about the victory of Moses over Am- \nalek,of Gideon over Midian,and of David over \nGoliath, and about the destruction of "Thy \nJerusalem," and she prayed to God with the \ntenderness and emotion with which her heart \nwas overflowing, but without fully understand- \ning what she was asking of God in that prayer. \nShe shared with all her heart in the prayer for \nthe spirit of righteousness, for the strengthen- \ning of the heart by faith and hope, and its an- \nimation by love. But she could not pray that \nher enemies might be trampled under foot \nwhen but a few minutes before she had been \nwishing she had more of them that she might \npray for them. But neither could she doubt \nthe righteousness of the prayer that was being \nread on bended knees. She felt in her heart a \ndevout and tremulous awe at the thought of \nthe punishment that overtakes men for their \nsins, and especially of her own sins, and she \nprayed to God to forgive them all, and her too, \nand to give them all, and her too, peace and \nhappiness. And it seemed to her that God \nheard her prayer. \n\nCHAPTER XIX \n\nFROM THE DAY when Pierre, after leaving the \nRost6vs' with Natasha's grateful look fresh in \nhis mind, had gazed at the comet that seemed to \nbe fixed in the sky and felt that something new \nwas appearing on his own horizon from that \nday the problem of the vanity and uselessness \nof all earthly things, that had incessantly tor- \nmented him, no longer presented itself. That \nterrible question "Why?" "Wherefore?" which \nhad come to him amid every occupation, was \nnow replaced, not by another question or by a \n\n\n\nreply to the former question, but by her image. \nWhen he listened to, or himself took part in, \ntrivial conversations, when he read or heard \nof human baseness or folly, he was not horri- \nfied as formerly, and did not ask himself why \nmen struggled so about these things when all \nis so transient and incomprehensiblebut he \nremembered her as he had last seen her, and \nall his doubts vanished not because she had \nanswered the questions that had haunted him, \nbut because his conception of her transferred \nhim instantly to another, a brighter, realm of \nspiritual activity in which no one could be jus- \ntified or guilty a realm of beauty and love \nwhich it was worth living for. Whatever world- \nly baseness presented itself to him, he said to \nhimself: \n\n"Well, supposing N. N. has swindled the \ncountry and the Tsar, and the country and the \nTsar confer honors upon him, what does that \nmatter? She smiled at me yesterday and asked \nme to come again, and I love her, and no one \nwill ever know it." And his soul felt calm and \npeaceful. \n\nPierre still went into society, drank as much \nand led the same idle and dissipated life, be- \ncause besides the hours he spent at the Ros- \nt6vs' there were other hours he had to spend \nsomehow, and the habits and acquaintances he \nhad made in Moscow formed a current that \nbore him along irresistibly. But latterly, when \nmore and more disquieting reports came from \nthe seat of war and Natasha's health began to \nimprove and she no longer aroused in him the \nformer feeling of careful pity, an ever-increas- \ning restlessness, which he could not explain, \ntook possession of him. He felt that the condi- \ntion he was in could not continue long, that \na catastrophe was coming which would change \nhis whole life, and he impatiently sought ev- \nerywhere for signs of that approaching catas- \ntrophe. One of his brother Masons had re- \nvealed to Pierre the following prophecy con- \ncerning Napoleon, drawn from the Revelation \nof St. John. \n\nIn chapter 13, verse 18, of the Apocalypse, \nit is said: \n\nHere is wisdom. Let him that hath un- \nderstanding count the number of the \nbeast: for it is the number of a man; and \nhis number is Six hundred threescore and \nsix. \nAnd in the fifth verse of the same chapter: \n\nAnd there was given unto him a mouth \nspeaking great things and blasphemies; \n\n\n\n378 \n\nand power was given unto him to contin- \nue forty and two months. \n\nThe French alphabet, written out with the \nsame numerical values as the Hebrew, in which \nthe first nine letters denote units and the oth- \ners tens, will have the following significance: \n\n\n\na \ni \n1 \n\n20 \n\n\n\nb c \n\n* 3 \nm \n30 40 \n\n\n\nn \n\n\n\nt \n100 \n\n\n\nu \nno \n\n\n\ne \n\n5 \no \n\n50 \n\nV \n120 \n\n\n\nf g h \n678 \n\np q \nGO 70 \n\nw \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\nwhat means, he was connected with the great \nevent foretold in the Apocalypse he did not \nknow, but he did not doubt that connection \nfor a moment. His love for Natdsha, Antichrist, \nNapoleon, the invasion, the comet, 666, L'Em- \npereurNapole'on^nd L'russe Besuhof all this \nhad to mature and culminate, to lift him out \nof that spellbound, petty sphere of Moscow \nhabits in which he felt himself held captive, and \nlead him to a great achievement and great hap- \npiness. \n\n\n\ni k \n\n9 \nr \n\n80 90 \nx y \n\n\n\n10 \n\ns \n\n\n\n130 140 150 \n\n\n\nz \n\n160 \n\n\n\nWriting the words L'Empereur Napoleon in \nnumbers, it appears that the sum of them is \n666, 1 and that Napoleon was therefore the beast \nforetold in the Apocalypse. Moreover, by ap- \nplying the same system to the words quarante- \ndeuxf which was the term allowed to the beast \nthat "spoke great things and blasphemies," the \nsame number 666 was obtained; from which \nit followed that the limit fixed for Napoleon's \npower had come in the year 1812 when the \nFrench emperor was forty-two. This prophecy \npleased Pierre very much and he often asked \nhimself what would put an end to the power \nof the beast, that is, of Napoleon, and tried by \nthe same system of using letters as numbers and \nadding them up, to find an answer to the ques- \ntion that engrossed him. He wrote the words \nL'Empereur Alexandre, La nation russe and \nadded up their numbers, but the sums were \neither more or less than 666. Once when mak- \ning such calculations he wrote down his own \nname in French, Comte Pierre Besouhoff, but \nthe sum of the numbers did not come right. \nThen he changed the spelling, substituting a \nz for the s and adding de and the article le, still \nwithout obtaining the desired result. Then it \noccurred to him: if the answer to the question \nwere contained in his name, his nationality \nwould also be given in the answer. So he wrote \nLe russe Besuhof and adding up the numbers \ngot 671. This was only five too much, and five \nwas represented by e, the very letter elided \nfrom the article le before the word Empereur. \nBy omitting the e&gt; though incorrectly, Pierre \ngot the answer he sought. L'russe Besuhof made \n666. This discovery excited him. How, or by \n\n1 Including a 5 for the letter e dropped by eli- \nsion from the le before Empereur. TR. \n1 Forty-two. \n\n\n\nOn the eve of the Sunday when the special \nprayer was read, Pierre had promised the Ros- \nt6vs to bring them, from Count Rostopchfn \nwhom he knew well, both the appeal to the \npeople and the latest news from the army. In \nthe morning, when he went to call at Rostop- \nchin's he met there a courier fresh from the ar- \nmy, an acquaintance of his own, who often \ndanced at Moscow balls. \n\n"Do, please, for heaven's sake, relieve me of \nsomething!" said the courier. "I have a sackful \nof letters to parents." \n\nAmong these letters wat one from Nicholas \nRost6vto his father. Pierre took that letter, and \nRostopchfn also gave him the Emperor's ap- \npeal to Moscow, which had just been printed, \nthe last army orders, and his own most recent \nbulletin. Glancing through the army orders, \nPierre found in one of them, in the lists of killed, \nwounded, and rewarded, the name of Nicholas \nRost6v, awarded a St. George's Cross of the \nFourth Class for courage shown in the Ostr6v- \nna affair, and in the same order the name of \nPrince Andrew Bolk6nski, appointed to the \ncommand of a regiment of Chasseurs. Though \nhe did not want to remind the Rost6vs of Bol- \nk6nski, Pierre could not refrain from making \nthem happy by the news of their son's having \nreceived a decoration, so he sent that printed \narmy order and Nicholas' letter to the Rost6vs, \nkeeping the appeal, the bulletin, and the other \norders to take with him when he went to din- \nner. \n\nHis conversation with Count Rostopchin \nand the latter's toneof anxious hurry, the meet- \ning with the courier who talked casually of how \nbadly things were going in the army, the ru- \nmors of the disco very of spies in Moscow and of \na leaflet in circulation stating that Napoleon \npromised to be in both the Russian capitals by \nthe autumn, and the talk of the Emperor's being \nexpected to arrive next day all aroused with \nfresh force that feeling of agitation and expec- \ntation in Pierre which he had been conscious \n\n\n\nBOOK NINE \n\n\n\nof ever since the appearance of the comet, and \nespecially since the beginning of the war. \n\nHe had long been thinking of enter ing the ar- \nmy and would have done so had he not been \nhindered, first, by his membership of the Society \nof Freemasons to which he was bound by oath \nand which preached perpetual peace and the ab- \nolition of war, and secondly, by the fact that \nwhen he saw the great mass of Muscovites who \nhad donned uniform and were talking patriot- \nism, he somehow felt ashamed to take the step. \nBut the chief reason for not carrying out his \nintention to enter the army lay in the vague \nidea that he was L'russe Besuhof who had the \nnumber of the beast, 666; that his part in the \ngreat affair of setting a limit to the power of \nthe beast that spoke great and blasphemous \nthings had been predestined from eternity, and \nthat therefore he ought not to undertake any- \nthing, but wait for what was bound to come to \npass. \n\nCHAPTER XX \n\nA FEW INTIMATE FRIENDS were dining with the \nRost6vs that day, as usual on Sundays. \n\nPierre came early so as to find them alone. \n\nHe had grown so stout this year that he \nwould have been abnormal had he not been so \ntall, so broad of limb, and so strong that he car- \nried his bulk with evident ease. \n\nHe went up the stairs, puffing and muttering \nsomething. His coachman did not even ask \nwhether he was* to wait. He knew that when his \nmaster was at the Rost6vs' he stayed till mid- \nnight. The Rost6vs' footman rushed eagerly \nforward to help him off with his cloak and take \nhis hat and stick. Pierre, from club habit, al- \nways left both hat and stick in the anteroom. \n\nThe first person he saw in the house was Na- \ntasha. Even before he saw her, while taking off \nhis cloak, he heard her. She was practicing sol- \nfa exercises in the music room. He knew that \nshe had not sung since her illness, and so the \nsound of her voice surprised and delighted him. \nHe opened the door softly and saw her, in the \nlilac dress she had worn at church, walking \nabout the room singing. She had her back to \nhim when he opened the door, but when, turn- \ning quickly, she saw his broad, surprised face, \nshe blushed and came rapidly up to him. \n\n"I want to try to sing again," she said, add- \ning as if by way of excuse, "it is, at least, some- \nthing to do*" \n\n"That's capital!" \n\n"How glad I am you've come! I am so hap- \npy today," she said, with the old animation \n\n\n\n379 \n\n\n\nPierre had not seen in her for a long time. "You \nknow Nicholas has received a St. George's \nCross? I am so proud of him." \n\n"Oh yes, I sent that announcement. But I \ndon't want to interrupt you," he added, and \nwas about to go to the drawing room. \n\nNatasha stopped him. \n\n"Count, is it wrong of me to sing?" she said \nblushing, and fixing her eyes inquiringly on \nhim. \n\n"No . . . Why should it be? On the contrary \n. . . But why do you ask me?" \n\n"I don't know myself," Natdsha answered \nquickly, "but I should not like to do anything \nyou disapproved of. I believe in you complete- \nly. You don't know how important you are to \nme, how much you've done for me. ..." She \nspoke rapidly and did not notice how Pierre \nflushed at her words. "I saw in that same army \norder that he, Bolk6nski" (she whispered the \nname hastily), "is in Russia, and in the army \nagain. What do you think?" she was speaking \nhurriedly, evidently afraid her strength might \nfail her "Will he ever forgive me? Will he not \nalways have a bitter feeling toward me? What \ndo you think? What do you think?" \n\n"I think . . ." Pierre replied, "that he has \nnothing to forgive If I were in his place . . ." \n\nBy association of ideas, Pierre was at once \ncarried back to the day when, trying to com- \nfort her, he had said that if he were not him- \nself but the best man in the world and free, he \nwould ask on his knees for her hand; and the \nsame feeling of pity, tenderness, and love took \npossession of him and the same words rose to \nhis lips. But she did not give him time to say \nthem. \n\n"Yes, you . . . you . . ." she said, uttering the \nword you rapturously" that's a different thing. \nI know no one kinder, more generous, or bet- \nter than you; nobody could be! Had you not \nbeen there then, and now too, I don't know \nwhat would have become of me, because . . ." \n\nTears suddenly rose in her eyes, she turned \naway, lifted her music before her eyes, began \nsinging again, and again began walking up and \ndown the room. \n\nJust then Ptya came running in from the \ndrawing room. \n\nPtkya was now a handsome rosy lad of fifteen \nwith full red lips and resembled Natasha. He \nwas preparing to enter the university, but he \nand his friend Obotenski had lately, in secret, \nagreed to join the hussars. \n\nPtya had come rushing out to talk to hia \nnamesake about this affair. He had asked \n\n\n\n380 WAR AND PEACE \n\nPierre to find out whether he would be accepted \nin the hussars. \n\nPierre walked up and down the drawing \nroom, not listening to what Ptya was saying. \n\nPe"tya pulled him by the arm to attract his \nattention. \n\n"Well, what about my plan? Peter Kirttych, \nfor heaven's sake! You are my only hope I" said \nPekya. \n\n"Oh yes, your plan. To join the hussars? I'll \nmention it, I'll bring it all up today." \n\n"Well, mon cher, have you got the manifes- \nto?" asked the old count. "The countess has \nbeen to Mass at the Razumovskis' and heard \nthe new prayer. She says it's very fine." \n\n"Yes, I've got it," said Pierre. "The Emperor \nis to be here tomorrow . . . there's to be an Ex- \ntraordinary Meeting of the nobility, and they \nare talking of a levy of ten men per thousand. \nOh yes, let me congratulate you!" \n\n"Yes, yes, thank God! Well, and what news \nfrom the army?" \n\n"We are again retreating. They say we're al- \nready near Smolensk," replied Pierre. \n\n"O Lord, O Lord!" exclaimed the count. \n"Where is the manifesto?" \n\n"The Emperor's appeal? Oh yes!" \n\nPierre began feeling in his pockets for the \npapers, but could not find them. Still slapping \nhis pockets, he kissed the hand of the countess \nwho entered the room and glanced uneasily \naround, evidently expecting Natasha, who had \nleft off singing but had not yet come into the \ndrawing room. \n\n"On my word, I don't know what I've done \nwith it," he said. \n\n"There he is, always losing everything!" re- \nmarked the countess. \n\nNatasha entered with a softened and agitat- \ned expression of face and sat down looking si- \nlently at Pierre. As soon as she entered, Pierre's \nfeatures, which had been gloomy, suddenly \nlighted up, and while still searching for the pa- \npers he glanced at her several times. \n\n"No, really! I'll drive home, I must have left \nthem there. I'll certainly . . ." \n\n"But you'll be late for dinner." \n\n"Oh! And my coachman has gone." \n\nBut S6nya, who had gone to look for the pa- \npers in the anteroom, had found them in \nPierre's hat, where he had carefully tucked \nthem under the lining. Pierre was about to be- \ngin reading. \n\n"No, after dinner," said the old count, evi- \ndently expecting much enjoyment from that \nreading. \n\n\n\nAt dinner, at which champagne was drunk to \nthe health of the new chevalier of St. George, \nShinshfn told them the town news, of the ill- \nness of the old Georgian princess, of Mdtivier's \ndisappearance from Moscow, and of how some \nGerman fellow had been brought to Rostop- \nchin and accused of being a French "spyer" (so \nCount Rostopchin had told thestory),and how \nRostopchfn let him go and assured the people \nthat he was "not a spire at all, but only an old \nGerman ruin." \n\n"People are being arrested . . ." said the \ncount. "I've told the countess she should not \nspeak French so much. It's not the time for it \nnow." \n\n"And have you heard?" Shinshin asked. \n"Prince Golitsyn has engaged a master to teach \nhim Russian. It is becoming dangerous to speak \nFrench in the streets." \n\n"And how about you, Count Peter Kirilych? \nIf they call up the militia, you too will have to \nmount a horse," remarked the old count, ad- \ndressing Pierre. \n\nPierre had been silent and preoccupied all \nthrough dinner, seeming not to grasp what was \nsaid. He looked at the count. \n\n"Oh yes, the war," he said. "No! What sort \nof warrior should I make? And yet everything \nis so strange, so strange! I can't make it out. I \ndon't know, I am very far from having military \ntastes, but in these times no one can answer \nfor himself." \n\nAfter dinner the count settled himself com- \nfortably in an easy chair and with a serious \nface asked Sonya, who was considered an ex- \ncellent reader, to read the appeal. \n\n"To Moscow, our ancient Capital! \n\n"The enemy has entered the borders of Russia \nwith immense forces. He comes to despoil our be- \nloved country," \n\nSonya read painstakingly in her high-pitched \nvoice. The count listened with closed eyes, \nheaving abrupt sighs at certain passages. \n\nNatasha sat erect, gazing with a searching \nlook now at her father and now at Pierre. \n\nPierre felt her eyes on him and tried not to \nlook round. The countess shook her head dis- \napprovingly and angrily at every solemn expres- \nsion in the manifesto. In all these words she \nsaw only that the danger threatening her son \nwould not soon be over. Shinshin, with a sar- \ncastic smile on his lips, was evidently preparing \nto make fun of anything that gave him the op- \nportunity: S6nya's reading, any remark of the \ncount's, or even the manifesto itself should no \nbetter pretext present itself. \n\n\n\nBOOK \n\nAfter reading about the dangers that threat- \nened Russia, the hopes the Emperor placed on \nMoscow and especially on its illustrious nobil- \nity, S6nya, with a quiver in her voice due chief- \nly to the attention that was being paid to her, \nread the last words: \n\n"We ourselves will not delay to appear among \nour people in that Capital and in others parts of \nour realm for consultation, and for the direction \nof all our levies, both those now barring the ene- \nmy's path and those freshly formed to defeat him \nwherever he may appear. May the ruin he hopes to \nbring upon us recoil on his own head, and may \nEurope delivered from bondage glorify the name \nof Russia!" \n\n"Yes, that's itl" cried the count, opening his \nmoist eyes and sniffing repeatedly, as if a strong \nvinaigrette had been held to his nose; and he \nadded, "Let the Emperor but say the word and \nwe'll sacrifice everything and begrudge noth- \ning." \n\nBefore Shinshin had time to utter the joke \nhe was ready to make on the count's patriotism, \nNatdsha jumped up from her place and ran to \nher father. \n\n"What a darling our Papa isl" she cried, kiss- \ning him, and she again looked at Pierre with \nthe unconscious coquetry that had returned to \nher with her better spirits. \n\n"There! Here's a patriot for you!" said Shin- \nshin. \n\n"Not a patriot at all, but simply . . ." Natdsha \nreplied in an injured tone. "Everything seems \nfunny to you, but this isn't at all a joke. . . ." \n\n"A joke indeed!" put in the count. "Let him \nbut say the word and we'll all go. ... We're \nnot Germansl" \n\n"But did you notice, it says, 'for consulta- \ntion'?" said Pierre. \n\n"Never mind what it's for. . . ." \n\nAt this moment, Ptya, to whom nobody \nwas praying any attention, came up to his \nfather with a very flushed face and said in his \nbreaking voice that was now deep and now \nshrill: \n\n"Well, Papa, I tell you definitely, and Mam- \nma too, it's as you please, but I say definitely \nthat you must let me enter the army, because I \ncan't . . . that's all. . . ." \n\nThe countess, in dismay, looked up to heav- \nen, clasped her hands, and turned angrily to \nher husband. \n\n"That comes of your talking!" said she. \n\nBut the count had already recovered from \nhis excitement. \n\n\n\nNINE 381 \n\n"Come, come!" said he. "Here's a fine war- \nrior! No! Nonsense! You must study." \n\n"It's not nonsense, Papa. Fedya Obotenski is \nyounger than I, and he's going too. Besides, all \nthe same I can't study now when . . ." Petya \nstopped short, flushed till he perspired, but \nstill got out the words, "when our Fatherland \nis in danger." \n\n"That'll do, that'll do nonsense. . . ." \n\n"But you said yourself that we would sacri- \nfice everything." \n\n"Pckya! Be quiet, I tell you!" cried the count, \nwith a glance at his wife, who had turned pale \nand was staring fixedly at her son. \n\n"And I tell you Peter Kirttych here will also \ntell you . . ." \n\n"Nonsense, I tell you. Your mother's milk \nhas hardly dried on your lips and you want to \ngo into the army! There, there, I tell you," and \nthe count moved to go out of the room, taking \nthe papers, probably to reread them in his \nstudy before having a nap. \n\n"Well, Peter Kiiilych, let's go and have a \nsmoke," he said. \n\nPierre was agitated and undecided. Natasha's \nunwontedly brilliant eyes, continually glancing \nat him with a more than cordial look, had re- \nduced him to this condition. \n\n"No, I think I'll go home." \n\n"Home? Why, you meant to spend the eve- \nning with us. ... You don't often come nowa- \ndays as it is, and this girl of mine," said the \ncount good-naturedly, pointing to Natasha, \n"only brightens up when you're here." \n\n"Yes, I had forgotten ... I really must \ngo home . . . business . . ." said Pierre hur- \nriedly. \n\n"Well, then, au revoir!" said the count, and \nwent out of the room. \n\n"Why are you going? Why are you upset?" \nasked Natdsha, and she looked challengingly \ninto Pierre's eyes. \n\n"Because I love you!" was what he wanted to \nsay, but he did not say it, and only blushed till \nthe tears came, and lowered his eyes. \n\n"Because it is better forme to come less of ten \n. . . because . . . No, simply I have business " \n\n"Why? No, tell me!" Natdsha began resolute- \nly and suddenly stopped. \n\nThey looked at each other with dismayed \nand embarrassed faces. He tried to smile \nbut could not: his smile expressed suffering, \nand he silently kissed her hand and went \nout. \n\nPierre made up his mind not to go to the Ros- \nt6vs' any more. \n\n\n\n382 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI \n\nAFTER THE definite refusal he had received, Pe*t- \nya went to his room and there locked himself \nin and wept bitterly. When he came in to tea, \nsilent, morose, and with tear-stained face, every- \nbody pretended not to notice anything. \n\nNext day the Emperor arrived in Moscow, \nand several of the Rost6vs' domestic serfs \nbegged permission to go to have a look at him. \nThat morning Pckya was a long time dressing \nand arranging his hair and collar to look like \na grown-up man. He frowned before his look- \ning glass, gesticulated, shrugged his shoulders, \nand finally, without saying a word to anyone, \ntook his cap and left the house by the back \ndoor, trying to avoid notice. P(hya decided to \ngo straight to where the Emperor was and to \nexplain frankly to some gentleman-in-waiting \n(he imagined the Emperor to be always sur- \nrounded by gentlemen-in-waiting) that he, \nCount Rost6v, in spite of his youth wished to \nserve his country; that youth could be no hin- \ndrance to loyalty, and that he was ready to ... \nWhile dressing, Pc^tya had prepared many fine \nthings he meant to say to the gentleman-in- \nwaiting. \n\nIt was on the very fact of being so young \nthat PeHya counted for success in reaching the \nEmperor he even thought how surprised every- \none would be at his youthfulriess and yet in \nthe arrangement of his collar and hair and by \nhis sedate deliberate walk he wished to appear \na grown-up man. But the farther he went and \nthe more his attention was diverted by the \never-increasing crowds moving toward the \nKremlin, the less he remembered to walk with \nthe sedateness and deliberation of a man. As \nhe approached the Kremlin he even began to \navoid being crushed and resolutely stuck out \nhis elbows in a menacing way. But within the \nTrinity Gateway he was so pressed to the wall \nby people who probably were unaware of the \npatriotic intentions with which he had come \nthat in spite of all his determination he had to \ngive in, and stop while carriages passed in, \nrumbling beneath the archway. Beside Pe"tya \nstood a peasant woman, a footman, two trades- \nmen, and a discharged soldier. After standing \nsome time in the gateway, Ptftya tried to move \nforward in front of the others without waiting \nfor all the carriages to pass, and he began reso- \nlutely working his way with his elbows, but the \nwoman just in front of him, who was the first \nagainst whom he directed his efforts, angrily \nshouted at him: \n\n"What are you shoving for, young lordling? \n\n\n\nDon't you see we're all standing still? Then \nwhy push?" \n\n"Anybody can shove," said the footman, and \nalso began working his elbows to such effect \nthat he pushed P^tya into a very filthy corner \nof the gateway. \n\nP6tya wiped his perspiring face with his \nhands and pulled up the damp collar which he \nhad arranged so well at home to seem like a \nman's. \n\nHe felt that he no longer looked presentable, \nand feared that if he were now to approach the \ngentlemen-in-waiting in that plight he would \nnot be admitted to the Emperor. But it was \nimpossible to smarten oneself up or move to \nanother place, because of the crowd. One of \nthe generals who drove past was an acquaint- \nance of the Rostcws', and P^tya thought of ask- \ning his help, but came to the conclusion that \nthat would not be a manly thing to do. When \nthe carriages had all passed in, the crowd, car- \nrying Ptya with it, streamed forward into the \nKrdmlin Square which was already full of peo- \nple. There were people not only in the square, \nbut everywhere on the slopes and on the roofs. \nAs soon as Ptftya found himself in the square \nhe clearly heard the sound of bells and the joy- \nous voices of the crowd that filled the whole \nKremlin. \n\nFor a while the crowd was less dense, but \nsuddenly all heads were bared, and everyone \nrushed forward in one direction. PC* tya was be- \ning pressed so that he could scarcely breathe, \nand everybody shouted, "Hurrah! hurrah! hur- \nrah!" Pe*tya stood on tiptoe and pushed and \npinched, but could see nothing except the peo- \nple about him. \n\nAll the faces bore the same expression of ex- \ncitement and enthusiasm. A tradesman's wife \nstanding beside Pe"tya sobbed, and the tears \nran down her cheeks. \n\n"Father! Angel! Dear one!" she kept repeat- \ning, wiping away her tears with her fingers. \n\n"Hurrah!" was heard on all sides. \n\nFor a moment the crowd stood still, but then \nit made another rush forward. \n\nQuite beside himself, P^tya, clinching his \nteeth and rolling his eyes ferociously, pushed \nforward, elbowing his way and shouting "hur- \nrah!" as if he were prepared that instant to kill \nhimself and everyone else, but on both sides \nof him other people with similarly ferocious \nfaces pushed forward and every body- shouted \n"hurrah!" \n\n"So this is what the Emperor is I" thought \nPehya. "No, I can't petition him myself that \n\n\n\nBOOK NINE \n\n\n\n383 \n\n\n\nwould be too bold." But in spite of this he con- \ntinued to struggle desperately forward, and \nfrom between the backs of those in front he \ncaught glimpses of an open space with a strip \nof red cloth spread out on it; but just then the \ncrowd swayed back the police in front were \npushing back those who had pressed too close \nto the procession: the Emperor was passing \nfrom the palace to the Cathedral of the As- \nsumptionand P(kya unexpectedly received \nsuch a blow on his side and ribs and was \nsqueezed so hard that suddenly everything \ngrew dim before his eyes and he lost conscious- \nness. When he came to himself, a man of cleri- \ncal appearance with a tuft of gray hair at the \nback of his head and wearing a shabby blue \ncassock probably a church clerk and chanter \nwas holding him under the arm withone hand \nwhile warding off the pressure of the crowd \nwith the other. \n\n"You've crushed the young gentleman!"said \nthe clerk. "What are you up to? Gently! . . . \nThey've crushed him, crushed him!" \n\nThe Emperor entered the Cathedral of the \nAssumption. The crowd spread out again more \nevenly, and the clerk led Ptftya pale and breath- \nlessto the Tsar-cannon. 1 Several people were \nsorry for Pe*tya, and suddenly a crowd turned \ntoward him and pressed round him. Those \nwho stood nearest him attended to him, un- \nbuttoned his coat, seated him on the raised \nplatform of the cannon, and reproached those \nothers (whoever they might be) who had \ncrushed him. \n\n"One might easily get killed that way! What \ndo they mean by it? Killing people! Poor dear, \nhe's as white as a sheet!" various voices were \nheard saying. \n\nPtya soon came to himself, the color re- \nturned to his face, the pain had passed, and at \nthe cost of that temporary unpleasantness he \nhad obtained a place by the cannon from where \nhe hoped to see the Emperor who would be re- \nturning that way. P(hya no longer thought of \npresenting his petition. If he could only see \nthe Emperor he would be happy 1 \n\nWhile the service was proceeding in the \nCathedral of the Assumption it was a com- \nbined service of prayer on the occasion of the \nEmperor's arrival and of thanksgiving for the \nconclusion of peace with the Turks the crowd \noutside spread out and hawkers appeared, sell- \ning kvas, gingerbread, and poppyseed sweets \n(of which Ptya was particularly fond), and- \n\n1 A very large cannon cast in 1488 and preserved \nin the Moscow Kremlin as a curiosity. TR. \n\n\n\nordinary conversation could again be heard. A \ntradesman's wife was showing a rent in her \nshawl and telling how much the shawl had \ncost; another was saying that all silk goods had \nnow got dear. The clerk who had rescued Pt- \nyawas talking to a functionary about the priests \nwho were officiating that day with the bishop. \nThe clerk several times used the word "plena- \nry" (of the service), a word P^tya did not un- \nderstand. Two young citizens were joking with \nsome serf girls who were cracking nuts. All \nthese conversations, especially the joking with \nthe girls, were such as might have had a par- \nticular charm for P^tya at his age, but they did \nnot interest him now. He sat on his elevation \nthe pedestal of the cannon still agitated as be- \nfore by the thought of the Emperor and by his \nlove for him. The feeling of pain and fear he \nhad experienced when he was being crushed, \ntogether with that of rapture, still further in- \ntensified his sense of the importance of the oc- \ncasion. \n\nSuddenly the sound of a firing of cannon \nwas heard from the embankment, to celebrate \nthe signing of peace with the Turks, and the \ncrowd rushed impetuously toward the embank- \nment to watch the firing. Pe"tya too would have \nrun there, but the clerk who had taken the \nyoung gentleman under his protection stopped \nhim. The firing was still proceeding when of- \nficers, generals, and gentlemen-in-waiting came \nrunning out of the cathedral, and after them \nothers in a more leisurely manner: caps were \nagain raised, and those who had run to look at \nthe cannon ran back again. At last four men in \nuniforms and sashes emerged from the cathe- \ndral doors. "Hurrah! hurrah!" shouted the \ncrowd again. \n\n"Which is he? Which?" asked P^tya in a \ntearful voice, of those around him, but no one \nanswered him, everybody was too excited; and \nPdtya, fixing on one of those four men, whom \nhe could not clearly see for the tears of joy that \nfilled his eyes, concentrated all his enthusiasm \non him though it happened not to be the Em- \nperorfrantically shouted "Hurrah!" and re- \nsolved that tomorrow, come what might, he \nwould join the army. \n\nThe crowd ran after the Emperor, followed \nhim to the palace, and began to disperse. It \nwas already late, and Ptya had not eaten any- \nthing and was drenched with perspiration, yet \nhe did not go home but stood with that dimin- \nishing, but still considerable, crowd before the \npalace while the Emperor dined looking in \nat the palace windows, expecting he knew not \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nwhat, .and envying alike the notables he saw \narriving at the entrance to dine with the Em- \nperor and the court footmen who served at \ntable, glimpses of whom could be seen through \nthe windows. \n\nWhile the Emperor was dining, Valuev, look- \ning out of the window, said: \n\n"The people are still hoping to see Your \nMajesty again." \n\nThe dinner was nearly over, and the Emper- \nor, munching a biscuit, rose and went out onto \nthe balcony. The people, with Petya among \nthem, rushed toward the balcony. \n\n"Angel! Dear one! Hurrah! Father! . . ." \ncried the crowd, and Ptya with it, and again \nthe women and men of weaker mold, Pdtya \namong them, wept with joy. \n\nA largish piece of the biscuit the Emperor \nwas holding in his hand broke off, fell on the \nbalcony parapet, and then to the ground. A \ncoachman in a jerkin, who stood nearest, sprang \nforward and snatched it up. Several people in \nthe crowd rushed at the coachman. Seeing this \nthe Emperor had a plateful of biscuits brought \nhim and began throwing them down from the \nbalcony. Ptya's eyes grew bloodshot, and still \nmore excited by the danger of being crushed, \nhe rushed at the biscuits. He did not know \nwhy, but he had to have a biscuit from the \nTsar's hand and he felt that he must not give \nway. He sprang forward and upset an old \nwoman who was catching at a biscuit; the old \nwoman did not consider herself defeated though \nshe was lying on the ground she grabbed at \nsome biscuits but her hand did not reach them. \nPe*tya pushed her hand away with his knee, \nseized a biscuit, and as if fearing to be too late, \nagain shouted "Hurrah!" with a voice already \nhoarse. \n\nThe Emperor went in, and after that the \ngreater part of the crowd began to disperse. \n\n"There I I said if only we waited and so it \nwas!" was being joyfully said by various peo- \npie. \n\nHappy as Ptya was, he felt sad at having to \ngo home knowing that all the enjoyment of \nthat day was over. He did not go straight home \nfrom the Kremlin, but called on his friend \nObol^nski, who was fifteen and was also enter- \ning the regiment. On returning home Ptya \nannounced resolutely and firmly that if he was \nnot allowed to enter the service he would run \naway. And next day, Count Ilyd Rost6v though \nhe had not yet quite yielded went to inquire \nhow he could arrange for Ptya to serve where \nthere would be least danger. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII \n\nTwo DAYS LATER, on the fifteenth of July, an \nimmense number of carriages were standing \noutside the Slob6da Palace. \nThe great halls were full. In the first were \nthe nobility and gentry in their uniforms, in \nthe second bearded merchants in full-skirted \ncoats of blue cloth and wearing medals. In the \nnoblemen's hall there was an incessant move- \nment and buzz of voices. The chief magnates \nsat on high-backed chairs at a large table under \nthe portrait of the Emperor, but most of the \ngentry were strolling about the room. \n\nAll these nobles, whom Pierre met every day \nat the Club or in their own houses, were in uni- \nform some in that of Catherine's day, others \nin that of the Emperor Paul, others again in \nthe new uniforms of Alexander's time or the \nordinary uniform of the nobility, and the gen- \neral characteristic of being in uniform imparted \nsomething strange and fantastic to these di- \nverse and familiar personalities, both old and \nyoung. The old men, dim-eyed, toothless, bald, \nsallow, and bloated, or gaunt and wrinkled, \nwere especially striking. For the most part they \nsat quietly in their places and were silent, or, \nif they walked about and talked, attached them- \nselves to someone younger. On all these faces, \nas on the faces of the crowd Petya had seen in \nthe Square, there was a striking contradiction: \nthe general expectation of a solemn event, and \nat the same time the everyday interests in a \nboston card party, Peter the cook,ZinafdaDmi- \ntrievna's health, and so on. \n\nPierre was there too, buttoned up since early \nmorning in a nobleman's uniform that had be- \ncome too tight for him. He was agitated; this \nextraordinary gathering not only of nobles but \nalso of the merchant-class les dtats gdntraux \n(States-General) evoked in him a whole series \nof ideas he had long laid aside but which were \ndeeply graven in his soul: thoughts of the Con- \ntrat social and the French Revolution. The \nwords that had struck him in the Emperor's \nappeal that the sovereign was coming to the \ncapital for consultation with his people- \nstrengthened this idea. And imagining that in \nthis direction something important which he \nhad long awaited was drawing near, he strolled \nabout watching and listening to conversations, \nbut nowhere finding any confirmation of the \nideas that occupied him. \n\nThe Emperor's manifesto was read, evoking \nenthusiasm, and then all moved about discus- \nsing it. Besides the ordinary topics of conver- \nsation, Pierre heard questions of where the \n\n\n\nBOOK \n\nmarshals of the nobility were to stand when \nthe Emperor entered, when a ball should be \ngiven in the Emperor's honor, whether they \nshould group themselves by districts or by \nwhole provinces . . . and so on; but as soon as \nthe war was touched on, or what the nobility \nhad been convened for, the talk became unde- \ncided and indefinite. Then all preferred listen- \ning to speaking. \n\nA middle-aged man, handsome and virile, in \nthe uniform of a retired naval officer, was speak- \ning in one of the rooms, and a small crowd was \npressing round him. Pierre went up to the cir- \ncle that had formed round the speaker and lis- \ntened. Count Ilyd Rost6v, in a military uni- \nform of Catherine's time, was sauntering with \na pleasant smile among the crowd, with all of \nwhom he was acquainted. He too approached \nthat group and listened with a kindly smile \nand nods of approval, as he always did, to what \nthe speaker was saying. The retired naval man \nwas speaking very boldly, as was evident from \nthe expression on the faces of the listeners and \nfrom the fact that some people Pierre knew as \nthe meekest and quietest of men walked away \ndisapprovingly or expressed disagreement with \nhim. Pierre pushed his way into the middle of \nthe group, listened, and convinced himself that \nthe man was indeed a liberal, but of views \nquite different from his own. The naval officer \nspoke in a particularly sonorous, musical, and \naristocratic baritone voice, pleasantly swallow- \ning his r's and generally slurring his conso- \nnants: the voice of a man calling out to his serv- \nant, "Heah! Bwing me my pipe!" It was indic- \native of dissipation and the exercise of author- \nity. \n\n"What if the Smolensk people have offahd \nto waise militia for the Empewah? Ah we to \ntake Smolensk as our patte'n? If the noble awis- \ntocwacy of the pwovince of Moscow thinks fit, \nit can show its loyalty to our sov'weign the \nEmpewah in othah ways. Have we fo'gotten \nthe waising of the militia in the yeah 'seven? \nAll that did was to enwich the pwiests' sons \nand thieves and wobbahs. . . ." \n\nCount llyd Rost6v smiled blandly and nod- \nded approval. \n\n"And was our militia of any use to the Em- \npia? Not at all! It only wuined our farmingl \nBettah have another conscwiption . . . o' ou' \nmen will wetu'n neithah soldiers no' peasants, \nand we'll get only depwavity fwom them. The \nnobility don't gwudge theah lives evewy one \nof us will go and bwing in more wecwuits, and \nthe sov'weign" (that was the way he referred \n\n\n\nNINE 385 \n\nto the Emperor) "need only say the word and \nwe'll all die fo* him!" added the orator with \nanimation. \n\nCount Rost6v's mouth watered with pleasure \nand he nudged Pierre, but Pierre wanted to \nspeak himself. He pushed forward, feeling \nstirred, but not yet sure what stirred him or \nwhat he would say. Scarcely had he opened his \nmouth when one of the senators, a man with- \nout a tooth in his head, with a shrewd though \nangry expression, standing near the first speak- \ner, interrupted him. Evidently accustomed to \nmanaging debates and to maintaining an ar- \ngument, he began in low but distinct tones: \n\n"I imagine, sir," said he, mumbling with his \ntoothless mouth, "that we have been summoned \nhere not to discuss whether it's best for the em- \npire at the present moment to adopt conscrip- \ntion or to call out the militia. We have been \nsummoned to reply to the appeal with which \nour sovereign the Emperor has honored us. \nBut to judge what is best conscription or the \nmilitia we can leave to the supreme authori- \nty. . . ." \n\nPierre suddenly saw an outlet for his excite- \nment. He hardened his heart against the sena- \ntor who was introducing this set and narrow \nattitude into the deliberations of the nobility. \nPierre stepped forward and interrupted him. \nHe himself did not yet know what he would \nsay, but he began to speak eagerly, occasional- \nly lapsing into French or expressing himself in \nbookish Russian. \n\n"Excuse me, your excellency," he began. (He \nwas well acquainted with the senator, but \nthought it necessary on this occasion to ad- \ndress him formally.) "Though I don't agree \nwith the gentleman . . ." (he hesitated: he \nwished to say, "Mon ires honorable pr^opin- \nant""My very honorable opponent") "with \nthe gentleman . . . whom I have not the honor \nof knowing, I suppose that the nobility have \nbeen summoned not merely to express their \nsympathy and enthusiasm but also to consider \nthe means by which we can assist our Father- \nland! I imagine," he went on, warming to his \nsubject, "that the Emperor himself would not \nbe satisfied to find in us merely owners of serfs \nwhom we are willing to devote to his service, \nand chair a canon* we are ready to make of \nourselves and not to obtain from us any co- \nco-counsel." \n\nMany persons withdrew from the circle, no- \nticing the senator's sarcastic smile and the free- \ndom of Pierre's remarks. Only Count Rost6v \n\n1 "Food for cannon." \n\n\n\n386 \n\n\n\nwas pleased with them as he had been pleased \nwith those of the naval officer, the senator, and \nin general with whatever speech he had last \nheard. \n\n"I think that before discussing these ques- \ntions," Pierre continued, "we should ask the \nEmperor most respectfully ask His Majesty \nto let us know the number of our troops and \nthe position in which our army and our forces \nnow are, and then . . ." \n\nBut scarcely had Pierre uttered these words \nbefore he was attacked from three sides. The \nmost vigorous attack came from an old ac- \nquaintance, a boston player who had always \nbeen well disposed toward him, Stepan Step- \nanovich Adraksin. Adraltsin was in uniform, \nand whether as a result of the uniform or from \nsome other cause Pierre saw before him quite a \ndifferent man. With a sudden expression of \nmalevolence on his aged face, Adrdksin shouted \nat Pierre: \n\n"In the first place, I tell you we have no right \nto question the Emperor about that, and sec- \nondly, if the Russian nobility had that right, \nthe Emperor could not answer such a question. \nThe troops are moved according to the enemy's \nmovements and the number of men increases \nand decreases " \n\nAnother voice, that of a nobleman of medi- \num height and about forty years of age, whom \nPierre had formerly met at the gypsies' and \nknew as a bad cardplayer, and who, also trans- \nformed by his uniform, came up to Pierre, in- \nterrupted Adrdksin. \n\n"Yes, and this is not a time for discussing," \nhe continued, "but for acting: there is war in \nRussia! The enemy is advancing to destroy \nRussia, to desecrate the tombs of our fathers, \nto carry off our wives and children." The no- \nbleman smote his breast. "We will all arise, \nevery one of us will go, for our father the \nTsar!" he shouted, rolling his bloodshot eyes. \nSeveral approving voices were heard in the \ncrowd. "We are Russians and will not grudge \nour blood in defense of our faith, the throne, \nand the Fatherland! We must cease raving if \nwe are sons of our Fatherland! We will show \nEurope how Russia rises to the defense of Rus- \nsia!" \n\nPierre wished to reply, but could not get in \na word. He felt that his words, apart from what \nmeaning they conveyed, were less audible than \nthe sound of his opponent's voice. \n\nCount Rost6v at the back of the crowd was \nexpressing approval; several persons, briskly \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\nturning a shoulder to the orator at the end of \n\n\n\na phrase, said: \n\n"That's right, quite right! Just so!" \n\nPierre wished to say that he was ready to \nsacrifice his money, his serfs, or himself, only \none ought to know the state of affairs in order \nto be able to improve it, but he was unable to \nspeak. Many voices shouted and talked at the \nsame time, so that Count Rost6v had not time \nto signify his approval of them all, and the \ngroup increased, dispersed, re-formed, and then \nmoved with a hum of talk into the largest hall \nand to the big table. Not only was Pierre's at- \ntempt to speak unsuccessful, but he was rude- \nly interrupted, pushed aside, and people turned \naway from him as from a common enemy. This \nhappened not because they were displeased by \nthe substance of his speech, which had even \nbeen forgotten after the many subsequent \nspeeches, but to animate it the crowd needed \na tangible object to love and a tangible object \nto hate. Pierre became the latter. Many other \norators spoke after the excited nobleman, and \nall in the same tone. Many spoke eloquently \nand with originality. \n\nGlinka, the editor of the Russian Messenger, \nwho was recognized (cries of "author! author!" \nwere heard in the crowd), said that "hell must \nbe repulsed by hell," and that he had seen a \nchild smiling at lightning flashes and thunder- \nclaps, but "we will not be that child." \n\n"Yes, yes, at thunderclaps!" was repeated \napprovingly in the back rows of the crowd. \n\nThe crowd drew up to the large table, at \nwhich sat gray-haired or bald seventy-year-old \nmagnates, uniformed and besashed, almost all \nof whom Pierre had seen in their own homes \nwith their buffoons, or playing boston at the \nclubs. With an incessant hum of voices the \ncrowd advanced to the table. Pressed by the \nthrong against the high backs of the chairs, the \norators spoke one after another and sometimes \ntwo together. Those standing behind noticed \nwhat a speaker omitted to say and hastened to \nsupply it. Others in that heat and crush racked \ntheir brains to find some thought and hastened \nto utter it. The old magnates, whom Pierre \nknew, sat and turned to look first at one and \nthen at another, and their faces for the most \npart only expressed the fact that they found it \nvery hot. Pierre, however, felt excited, and the \ngeneral desire to show that they were ready to \ngo to all lengthswhich found expression in \nthe tones and looks more than in the substance \nof the speeches infected him too. He did not \n\n\n\nBOOK \n\nrenounce his opinions, but felt himself in \nsome way to blame and wished to justify him- \nself. \n\n"I only said that it would be more to the \npurpose to make sacrifices when we know what \nis needed!" said he, trying to be heard above \nthe other voices. \n\nOne of the old men nearest to him looked \nround, but his attention was immediately di- \nverted by an exclamation at the other side of \nthe table. \n\n"Yes, Moscow will be surrenderedl She will \nbe our expiation!" shouted one man. \n\n"He is the enemy of mankind!" cried anoth- \ner. "Allow me to speak. . . ." "Gentlemen, you \nare crushing me! . . ." \n\nCHAPTER XXIII \n\nAT THAT MOMENT Count Rostopchfn with his \nprotruding chin and alert eyes, wearing the \nuniform of a general with sash over his shoul- \nder, entered the room, stepping briskly to the \nfront of the crowd of gentry. \n\n"Our sovereign the Emperor will be here in \na moment," said Rostopchfn. "I am straight \nfrom the palace. Seeing the position we are \nin, I think there is little need for discussion. \nThe Emperor has deigned to summon us \nand the merchants. Millions will pour forth \nfrom there" he pointed to the merchants' \nhall "but our business is to supply men and \nnot spare ourselves. . . . That is the least we \ncan do!" \n\nA conference took place confined to the \nmagnates sitting at the table. The whole con- \nsultation passed more than quietly. After all \nthe preceding noise the sound of their old \nvoices saying one after another, "I agree," or \nfor variety, "I too am of that opinion," and so \non had even a mournful effect. \n\nThe secretary was told to write down the \nresolution of the Moscow nobility and gentry, \nthat they would furnish ten men, fully \nequipped, out of every thousand serfs, as the \nSmolensk gentry had done. Their chairs made \na scraping noise as the gentlemen who had \nconferred rose with apparent relief, and began \nwalking up and d6wn, arm in arm, to stretch \ntheir legs and converse in couples. \n\n"The Emperor! The Emperor!" a sudden \ncry resounded through the halls and the whole \nthrong hurried to the entrance. \n\nThe Emperor entered the hall through a \nbroad path between two lines of nobles. Every \nface expressed respectful, awe-struck curiosity. \n\n\n\nNINE 387 \n\nPierre stood rather far off and could not hear \nall that the Emperor said. From what he did \nhear he understood that the Emperor spoke of \nthe danger threatening the empire and of the \nhopes he placed on the Moscow nobility. He \nwas answered by a voice which informed him \nof the resolution just arrived at. \n\n"Gentlemen!" said the Emperof with aquiv- \nering voice. \n\nThere was a rustling among the crowd and \nit again subsided, so that Pierre distinctly heard \nthe pleasantly human voice of the Emperor \nsaying with emotion: \n\n"I never doubted the devotion of the Rus- \nsian nobles, but today it has surpassed my ex- \npectations. I thank you in the name of the \nFatherland! Gentlemen, let us act! Time is \nmost precious " \n\nThe Emperor ceased speaking, the crowd \nbegan pressing round him, and rapturous ex- \nclamations were heard from all sides. \n\n"Yes, most precious ... a royal word," said \nCount Rost6v, with a sob. Hestood at the back, \nand, though he had heard hardly anything, un- \nderstood everything in his own way. \n\nFrom the hall of the nobility the Emperor \nwent to that of the merchants. There he re- \nmained about ten minutes. Pierre was among \nthose who saw him come out from the mer- \nchants' hall with tears of emotion in his eyes. \nAs became known later, he had scarcely begun \nto address the merchants before tears gushed \nfrom his eyes and he concluded in a trembling \nvoice. When Pierre saw the Emperor he was \ncoming out accompanied by two merchants, \none of whom Pierre knew, a fat otkupshchik. 1 \nThe other was the mayor, a man with a thin \nsallow face and narrow beard. Both were weep- \ning. Tears filled the thin man's eyes, and the \nfat otkupshchik sobbed outright like a child \nand kept repeating: \n\n"Our lives and property take them, Your \nMajesty!" \n\nPierre's one feeling at the moment was a de- \nsire to show that he was ready to go all lengths \nand was prepared to sacrifice everything. He \nnow felt ashamed of his speech with its consti- \ntutional tendency and sought an opportunity \nof effacing it. Having heard that Count Mam6- \nnov was furnishing a regiment, Beztikhov at \nonce informed Rostopchfn that he would give \na thousand men and their maintenance. \n\n*A dealer in spirits one who leased from the \ngovernment the monopoly of the sale of spirits for \na certain district.-Tn, \n\n\n\n388 WAR AND PEACE \n\nOld Rost6v could not tell his wife of what sembled nobles all took off their uniforms and \n\nhad passed without tears, and at once con- settled down again in their homes and clubs, \n\nsented to P6tya's request and went himself to and not without some groans gave orders to \n\nenter his name. their stewards about the enrollment, feeling \n\nNext day the Emperor left Moscow, The as- amazed themselves at what they had done. \n\n\n\nBook Ten: 1812 \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I \n\nNAPOLEON BEGAN the war with Russia because \nhe could not resist going to Dresden, could not \nhelp having his head turned by the homage he \nreceived, could not help donning a Polish uni- \nform and yielding to the stimulating influence \nof a June morning, and could not refrain from \nbursts of anger in the presence of Kurakin and \nthen of Balashev. \n\nAlexander refused negotiations because he \nfelt himself to be personally insulted. Barclay \nde Tolly tried to command the army in the \nbest way, because he wished to fulfill his duty \nand earn fame as a great commander. Rostov \ncharged the French because he could not re- \nstrain his wish for a gallop across a level field; \nand in the same way the innumerable people \nwho took part in the war acted in accord with \ntheir personal characteristics, habits, circum- \nstances, and aims. They were moved by fear or \nvanity, rejoiced or were indignant, reasoned, \nimagining that they knew what they were do- \ning and did it of their own free will, but they \nall were involuntary tools of history, carrying \non a work concealed from them but compre- \nhensible to us. Such is the inevitable fate of \nmen of action, and the higher they stand in the \nsocial hierarchy the less are they free. \n\nThe actors of 1812 have long since left the \nstage, their personal interests have vanished \nleaving no trace, anci nothing remains of that \ntime but its historic results. \n\nProvidence compelled all these men, striv- \ning to attain personal aims, to further the ac- \ncomplishment of a stupendous result no one \nof them at all expected neither Napoleon, \nnor Alexander, nor still less any of those who \ndid the actual fighting. \n\nThe cause of the destruction of the French \narmy in 1812 is clear to us now. No one will \ndeny that that cause was, on the one hand, its \nadvance into the heart of Russia late in the \nseason without any preparation for a winter \ncampaign and, on the 'other, the character giv- \nen to the war by the burning of Russian towns \n\n\n\nand the hatred of the foe this aroused among \nthe Russian people. But no one at the time \nforesaw (what now seems so evident) that this \nwas the only way an army of eight hundred \nthousand men the best in the world and led \nby the best general could be destroyed in con- \nflict with a raw army of half its numerical \nstrength, and led by inexperienced command- \ners as the Russian army was. Not only did no \none see this, but on the Russian side every ef- \nfort was made to hinder the only thing that \ncould save Russia, while on the French side, \ndespite Napoleon's experience and so-called \nmilitary genius, every effort was directed to \npushing on to Moscow at the end of the sum- \nmer, that is, to doing the very thing that was \nbound to lead to destruction. \n\nIn historical works on the year 1812 French \nwriters are very fond of saying that Napoleon \nfelt the danger of extending his line, that he \nsought a battle and that his marshals advised \nhim to stop at Smolensk, and of making similar \nstatements to show that the danger of the cam- \npaign was even then understood. Russian au- \nthors are still fonder of telling us that from the \ncommencement of the campaign a Scythian \nwar plan was adopted to lure Napoleon into \nthe depths of Russia, and this plan some of \nthem attribute to Pfuel, others to a certain \nFrenchman, others to Toll, and others again to \nAlexander himself pointing to notes, projects, \nand letters which contain hints of such a line \nof action. But all these hints at what happened, \nboth from the French side and the Russian, \nare advanced only because they fit in with the \nevent. Had that event not occurred these hints \nwould have been forgotten, as we have forgot- \nten the thousands and millions of hints and \nexpectations to the contrary which were cur- \nrent then but have now been forgotten because \nthe event falsified them. There are always so \nmany conjectures as to the issue of any event \nthat however it may end there will always be \npeople to say: "I said then that it would be so/' \nquite forgetting that amid their innumerable \n\n\n\n389 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nconjectures many were to quite the contrary \neffect. \n\nConjectures as to Napoleon's awareness of \nthe danger of extending his line, and (on the \nRussian side) as to luring the enemy into the \ndepths of Russia, are evidently of that kind, \nand only by much straining can historians at- \ntribute such conceptions to Napoleon and his \nmarshals, or such plans to the Russian com- \nmanders. All the facts are in flat contradiction \nto such conjectures. During the whole period \nof the war not only was there no wish on the \nRussian side to draw the French into the heart \nof the country, but from their first entry into \nRussia everything was done to stop them. And \nnot only was Napoleon not afraid to extend \nhis line, but he welcomed every step forward \nas a triumph and did not seek battle as eagerly \nas in former campaigns, but very lazily. \n\nAt the very beginning of the war our armies \nwere divided, and our sole aim was to unite \nthem, though uniting the armies was no ad- \nvantage if we meant to retire and lure the en- \nemy into the depths of the country. Our Em- \nperor joined the army to encourage it to de- \nfend every inch of Russian soil and not to re- \ntreat. The enormous Drissa camp was formed \non Pfuel's plan, and there was no intention of \nretiring farther. The Emperor reproached the \ncommanders in chief for every step they re- \ntired. He could not bear the idea of letting the \nenemy even reach Smolensk, still less could he \ncontemplate the burning of Moscow, and \nwhen our armies did unite he was displeased \nthat Smolensk was abandoned and burned \nwithout a general engagement having been \nfought under its walls. \n\nSo thought the Emperor, and the Russian \ncommanders and people were still more pro- \nvoked at the thought that our forces were re- \ntreating into the depths of the country. \n\nNapoleon having cut our armies apart ad- \nvanced far into the country and missed several \nchances of forcing an engagement. In August \nhe was at Smolensk and thought only of how to \nadvance farther, though as we now see that ad- \nvance was evidently ruinous to him. \n\nThe facts clearly show that Napoleon did \nnot foresee the danger of the advance on Mos- \ncow, nor did Alexander and the Russian com- \nmanders then think of luring Napoleon on, \nbut quite the contrary. The luring of Napo- \nleon into the depths of the country was not \nthe result of any plan, for no one believed it to \nbe possible; it resulted from a most complex \ninterplay of intrigues, aims, and wishes among \n\n\n\nthose who took part in the war and had no per- \nception whatever of the inevitable, or of the \none way of saving Russia. Everything came \nabout fortuitously. The armies were divided at \nthe commencement of the campaign. We tried \nto unite them, with the evident intention of \ngiving battle and checking the enemy's ad- \nvance, and by this effort to unite them while \navoiding battle with a much stronger enemy, \nand necessarily withdrawing the armies at an \nacute angle we led the French on to Smolensk. \nBut we withdrew at an acute angle not only \nbecause the French advanced between our two \narmies; the angle became still more acute and \nwe withdrew still farther, because Barclay de \nTolly was an unpopular foreigner disliked by \nBagrati6n (who would come under his com- \nmand), and Bagrati6n being in command of \nthe second army tried to postpone joining up \nand coming under Barclay's command as long \nas he could. Bagration was slow in effecting \nthe junction though that was the chief aim of \nall at headquarters because, as he alleged, he \nexposed his army to danger on this march, and \nit was best for him to retire more to the left \nand more to the south, worrying the enemy \nfrom flank and rear and securing from the \nUkraine recruits for his army; and it looks as \nif he planned this in order not to come under \nthe command of the detested foreigner Bar- \nclay, whose rank was inferior to his own. \n\nThe Emperor was with the army to encour- \nage it, but his presence and ignorance of what \nsteps to take, and the enormous number of ad- \nvisers and plans, destroyed the first army's en- \nergy and it retired. \n\nThe intention was to make a stand at the \nDrissa camp, but Paulucci, aiming at becom- \ning commander in chief, unexpectedly em- \nployed his energy to influence Alexander, and \nPfuel's whole plan was .abandoned and the \ncommand entrusted to Barclay. But as Barclay \ndid not inspire confidence his power was lim- \nited. The armies were divided, there was no \nunity of command, and Barclay was unpopu- \nlar; but from this confusion, division, and the \nunpopularity of the foreign commander in \nchief, there resulted on the one hand indecision \nand the avoidance of a battle (which we could \nnot have refrained from had the armies been \nunited and had someone else, instead of Bar- \nclay, been in command) and on the other an \never-increasing indignation against the foreign- \ners and an increase in patriotic zeal. \n\nAt last the Emperor left the army, and as the \nmost convenient and indeed the only pretext \n\n\n\nBOOK TEN \n\n\n\nfor his departure it was decided that it was nec- \nessary for him to inspire the people in the \ncapitals and arouse the nation in general to a \npatriotic war. And by this visit of the Emperor \nto Moscow the strength of the Russian army \nwas trebled. \n\nHe left in order not to obstruct the com- \nmander in chief's undivided control of the \narmy, and hoping that more decisive action \nwould then be taken, but the command of the \narmies became still more contused and enfee- \nbled. Bennigsen, the Tsare*vich, and a swarm \nof adjutants general remained with the army \nto keep the commander in chief under obser- \nvation and arouse his energy, and Barclay, \nfeeling less free than ever under the observa- \ntion of all these "eyes of the Emperor," be- \ncame still more cautious of undertaking any \ndecisive action and avoided giving battle. \n\nBarclay stood for caution. The Tsare*vich \nhinted at treachery and demanded a general \nengagement. Lubomirski, Bronnitski, Wlocki, \nand the others of that group stirred up so much \ntrouble that Barclay, under pretext of sending \npapers to the Emperor, dispatched these Polish \nadjutants general to Petersburg and plunged \ninto an open struggle with Bennigsen and the \nTsareVich. \n\nAt Smolensk the armies at last reunited, \nmuch as Bagrati6n disliked it. \n\nBagrati6n drove up in a carriage to the house \noccupied by Barclay. Barclay donned his sash \nand came out to meet and report to his senior \nofficer Bagrati6n. \n\nDespite his seniority in rank Bagrati6n, in \nthis contest of magnanimity, took his orders \nfrom Barclay, but, having submitted, agreed \nwith him less than ever. By the Emperor's or- \nders Bagration reported direct to him. He \nwrote to Arakche'ev, the Emperor's confidant: \n"It must be as my sovereign pleases, but I can- \nnot work with the Minister (meaning Barclay). \nFor God's sake send me somewhere else if only \nin command of a regiment. I cannot stand it \nhere. Headquarters are so full of Germans that \na Russian cannot exist and there is no sense in \nanything. I thought I was really serving my sov- \nereign and the Fatherland, but it turns out \nthat I am serving Barclay. I confess I do not \nwant to." \n\nThe swarm of Bronnftskis and Wintzinge- \nrodes and their like still further embittered the \nrelations between the commanders in chief, \nand even less unity resulted. Preparations were \nmade to fight th Frencn before Smolensk. A \ngeneral was sent to survey the position. This \n\n\n\ngeneral, hating Barclay, rode to visit a friend \nof his own, a corps commander, and, having \nspent the day with him, returned to Barclay \nand condemned, as unsuitable from every point \nof view, the battleground he had not seen. \n\nWhile disputes and intrigues were going on \nabout the future field of battle, and while we \nwere looking for the French having lost touch \nwith them the French stumbled upon Neve*- \nrovski's division and reached the walls of Smo- \ntensk. \n\nIt was necessary to fight an unexpected bat- \ntle at Smolensk to save our lines of communi- \ncation. The battle was fought and thousands \nwere killed on both sides. \n\nSmolensk was abandoned contrary to the \nwishes of the Emperor and of the whole peo- \nple. But Smol6nsk was burned by its own in- \nhabitants who had been misled by their gov.- \nernor. And these ruined inhabitants, setting \nan example to other Russians, went to Moscow \nthinking only of their own losses but kindling \nhatred of the foe. Napoleon advanced farther \nand we retired, thus arriving at the very result \nwhich caused his destruction. \n\nCHAPTER II \n\nTHE DAY after his son had left, Prince Nicholas \nsent for Princess Mary to come to his study. \n\n"Well? Are you satisfied now?" said he. \n"You've made me quarrel with my son! Satis- \nfied, are you? That's all you wanted! Satisfied? \n... It hurts me, it hurts. I'm old and weak and \nthis is what you wanted. Well then, gloat over \nit! Gloat over it!" \n\nAfter that Princess Mary did not see her fa- \nther for a whole week. He was ill and did not \nleave his study. \n\nPrincess Mary noticed to her surprise that \nduring this illness the old prince not only ex- \ncluded her from his room, but did not admit \nMademoiselle Bourienne either. Tikhon alone \nattended him. \n\nAt the end of the week the prince reappeared \nand resumed his former way of life, devoting \nhimself with special activity to building opera- \ntions and the arrangement of the gardens and \ncompletely breaking off his relations with \nMademoiselle Bourienne. His looks and cold \ntone to his daughter seemed to say: "There, \nyou see? You plotted against me, you lied to \nPrince Andrew about my relations with that \nFrenchwoman and made me quarrel with him, \nbut you see I need neither her nor you!" \n\nPrincess Mary spent half of every day with \nlittle Nicholas, watching his lessons, teaching \n\n\n\n39* WAR AND PEACE \n\nhim Russian and music herself, and talking to \nDessalles; the rest of the day she spent over her \nbooks, with her old nurse, or with "God's folk" \nwho sometimes came by the back door to see \nher. \n\nOf the war Princess Mary thought as women \ndo think about wars. She feared for her brother \nwho was in it, was horrified by and amazed at \nthe strange cruelty that impels men to kill one \nanother, but she did not understand the signif- \nicance of this war, which seemed to her like all \nprevious wars. She did not realize the signifi- \ncance of this war, though Dessalles with whom \nshe constantly conversed was passionately in- \ntereste&lt;J in its progress and tried to explain his \nown conception of it to her, and though the \n"God's folk" who came to see her reported, in \ntheir own way, the rumors current among the \npeople of an invasion by Antichrist, and though \nJulie (now Princess Drubetskdya), who had re- \nsumed correspondence with her, wrote patri- \notic letters from Moscow. \n\n"I write you in Russian, my good friend," \nwrote Julie in her Frenchified Russian, "be- \ncause I have a detestation for all the French, \nand the same for their language which I can- \nnot support to hear spoken We in Moscow \n\nare elated by enthusiasm for our adored Em- \nperor. \n\n"My poor husband is enduring pains and \nhunger in Jewish taverns, but the news which \nI have inspires me yet more. \n\n"You heard probably of the heroic exploit \nof Rae* vski, embracing his two sons and saying: \n'I will perish with them but we will not be \nshaken!' And truly though the enemy was \ntwice stronger than we, we were unshakable. \nWe pass the time as we can, but in war as in \nwar! The princesses Aline and Sophie sit whole \ndays with me, and we, unhappy widows of live \nmen, make beautiful conversations over our \nchar pie, only you, my friend, are missing ..." \nand so on. \n\nThe chief reason Princess Mary did not re- \nalize the full significance of this war was that \nthe old prince never spoke of it, did not recog- \nnize it, and laughed at Dessalles when he men- \ntioned it at dinner. The prince's tone was so \ncalm and confident that Princess Mary un- \nhesitatingly believed him. \n\nAll that July the old prince was exceedingly \nactive and even animated. He planned anoth- \ner garden and began a new building for the \ndomestic serfs. The only thing that made Prin- \ncess Mary anxious about him was that he slept \nvery little and, instead of sleeping in his study \n\n\n\nas usual, changed his sleeping place every day. \nOne day he would order his camp bed to be \nset up in the glass gallery, another day he re- \nmained on the couch or on the lounge chair in \nthe drawing room and dozed there without un- \ndressing, while instead of Mademoiselle Bou- \nrienne a serf boy read to him. Then again he \nwould spend a night in the dining room. \n\nOn August i, a second letter was received \nfrom Prince Andrew. In his first letter which \ncame soon after he had left home, Prince An- \ndrew had dutifully asked his father's forgive- \nness for what he had allowed himself to say \nand begged to be restored to his favor. To this \nletter the old prince had replied affectionately, \nand from that time had kept the Frenchwom- \nan at a distance. Prince Andrew's second let- \nter, written near Vitebsk after the French had \noccupied that town, gave a brief account of the \nwhole campaign, enclosed for them a plan he \nhad drawn and forecasts as to the further prog- \nress of the war. In this letter Prince Andrew \npointed out to his father the danger of staying \nat Bald Hills, so near the theater of war and on \nthe army's direct line of march, and advised \nhim to move to Moscow. \n\nAt dinner that day, on Dessalles' mention- \ning that the French were said to have already \nentered Vitebsk, the old prince remembered \nhis son's letter. \n\n"There was a letter from Prince Andrew to- \nday," he said to Princess Mary "Haven't you \nread it?" \n\n"No, Father," she replied in a frightened \nvoice. \n\nShe could not have read the letter as she did \nnot even know it had arrived. \n\n"He writes about this war," said the prince, \nwith the ironic smile that had become habitual \nto him in speaking of the present war. \n\n"That must be very interesting," said Des- \nsalles. "Prince Andrew is in a position to \nknow . . ." \n\n"Oh, very interesting!" said Mademoiselle \nBourienne. \n\n"Go and get it for me," said the old prince \nto Mademoiselle Bourienne. "You knowun- \nder the paperweight on the little table." \n\nMademoiselle Bourienne jumped up ea- \ngerly. \n\n"No, don't!" he exclaimed with a frown. \n"You go, Michael Ivdnovich." \n\nMichael Iv^novich rose and went to the \nstudy. But as soon as he had left the room the \nold prince, looking uneasily round, threw \ndown his napkin and went himself. \n\n\n\nBOOK TEN \n\n\n\n393 \n\n\n\n"They can't do anything . . . always make \nsome muddle," he muttered. \n\nWhile he was away Princess Mary, Dessalles, \nMademoiselle Bourienne, and even little Nich- \nolas exchanged looks in silence. The old prince \nreturned with quick steps, accompanied by \nMichael Ivdnovich, bringing the letter and a \nplan. These he put down beside himnot let- \nting anyone read them at dinner. \n\nOn moving to the drawing room he handed \nthe letter to Princess Mary and, spreading out \nbefore him the plan of the new building and \nfixing his eyes upon it, told her to read the let- \nter aloud. When she had done so Princess \nMary looked inquiringly at her father. He was \nexamining the plan, evidently engrossed in his \nown ideas. \n\n"What do you think of it, Prince?" Dessalles \nventured to ask. \n\n"1? I? . . ." said the prince as if unpleasantly \nawakened, and not taking his eyes from the \nplan of the building. \n\n"Very possibly the theater of war will move \nso near to us that . . ." \n\n"Ha ha ha! The theater of warl" said the \nprince. "I have said and still say that the thea- \nter of war is Poland and the enemy will never \nget beyond the Niemen." \n\nDessalles looked in amazement at the prince, \nwho was talking of the Niemen when the en- \nemy was already at the Dnieper, but Princess \nMary, forgetting the geographical position of \nthe Niemen, thought that what her father was \nsaying was correct. \n\n"When the snow melts they'll sink in the \nPolish swamps. Only they could fail to see it," \nthe prince continued, evidently thinking of \nthe campaign of 1807 which seemed to him so \nrecent. "Bennigsen should have advanced in- \nto Prussia sooner, then things would have tak- \nen a different turn . . ." \n\n"But, Prince," Dessalles began timidly, "the \nletter mentions Vitebsk " \n\n"Ah, the letter? Yes . . ." replied the prince \npeevishly. "Yes ... yes .. ." His face suddenly \ntook on a morose expression. He paused. "Yes, \nhe writes that the French were beaten at ... at \n. . . what river is it?" \n\nDessalles dropped his eyes. \n\n"The prince says nothing about that," he re- \nmarked gently. \n\n"Doesn't he? But I didn't invent it myself." \n\nNo one spoke for a long time. \n\n"Yes ... yes .. .Well, Michael Ivdnovich," \nhe suddenly went on, raising his head and \npointing to the plan of the building, "tell me \n\n\n\nhow you mean to alter it. . . ." \n\nMichael Ivdnovich went up to the plan, and \nthe prince after speaking to him about the new \nbuilding looked angrily at Princess Mary and \nDessalles and went to his own room. \n\nPrincess Mary saw Dessalles' embarrassed \nand astonished look fixed on her father, no- \nticed his silence, and was struck by the fact that \nher father had forgotten his son's letter on the \ndrawing-room table; but she was not only \nafraid to speak of it and ask Dessalles the rea- \nson of his confusion and silence, but was afraid \neven to think about it. \n\nIn the evening Michael Ivdnovich, sent by \nthe ptince, came to Princess Mary for Prince \nAndrew's letter which had been forgotten in \nthe drawing room. She gave it to him and, un- \npleasant as it was to her to do so, ventured to \nask him what her father was doing. \n\n"Always busy," replied Michael Ivdnovich \nwith a respectfully ironic smile which caused \nPrincess Mary to turn pale. "He's worrying \nvery much about the new building. He has \nbeen reading a little, but now" Michael Ivan- \novich went on, lowering his voice "now he's \nat his desk, busy with his will, I expect." (One \nof the prince's favorite occupations of late had \nbeen the preparation of some papers he meant \nto leave at his death and which he called his \n"will.") \n\n"And Alpdtych is being sent to Smolensk?" \nasked Princess Mary. \n\n"Oh, yes, he has been waiting to start for \nsome time." \n\nCHAPTER III \n\nWHEN MICHAEL IVANOVICH returned to the \nstudy with the letter, the old prince, with spec- \ntacles on and a shade over his eyes, was sitting \nat his open bureau with screened candles, hold- \ning a paper in his outstretched hand, and in a \nsomewhat dramatic attitude was reading his \nmanuscript his "Remarks" as he termed it \nwhich was to be transmitted to the Emperor \nafter his death. \n\nWhen Michael Ivdnovich went in there were \ntears in the prince's eyes evoked by the memo- \nry of the time when the paper he was now read- \ning had been written. He took the letter from \nMichael Ivdnovich's hand, put it in his pocket, \nfolded up his papers, and called in Alpdtych \nwho had long been waiting. \n\nThe prince had a list of things to be bought \nin Smolensk and, walking up and down the \nroom past Alpdtych who stood by the door, he \ngave his instructions. \n\n\n\n394 WAR AND PEACE \n\n"First, notepaper do you hear? Eight quires, \nlike this sample, gilt-edged ... it must be exact- \nly like the sample. Varnish, sealing wax, as in \nMichael Ivdnovich's list." \n\nHe paced up and down for a while and \nglanced at his notes. \n\n"Then hand to the governor in person a let- \nter about the deed." \n\nNext, bolts for the doors of the new build- \ning were wanted and had to be of a special \nshape the prince had himself designed, and a \nleather case had to be ordered to keep the \n"will" in. \n\nThe instructions to Alpdtych took over two \nhours and still the prince did not let him go. \nHe sat down, sank into thought, closed his eyes, \nand dozed off. Alpdtych made a slight move- \nment. \n\n"Well, go, go! If anything more is wanted \nI'll send after you." \n\nAlpdtych went out. The prince again went \nto his bureau, glanced into it, fingered his pa- \npers, closed the bureau again, and sat down at \nthe table to write to the governor. \n\nIt was already late when he rose after seal- \ning the letter. He wished to sleep, but he knew \nhe would not be able to and that most depress- \ning thoughts came to him in bed. So he called \nTikhon and went through the rooms with him \nto show him where to set up the bed for that \nnight. \n\nHe went about looking at every corner. \nEvery place seemed unsatisfactory, but worst \nof all was his customary couch in the study. \nThat couch was dreadful to him, probably be- \ncause of the oppressive thoughts he had had \nwhen lying there. It was unsatisfactory every- \nwhere, but the corner behind the piano in the \nsitting room was better than other places: he \nhad never slept there yet. \n\nWith the help of a footman Tfkhon brought \nin the bedstead and began putting it up. \n\n"That's not right! That's not right!" cried \nthe prince, and himself pushed it a few inches \nfrom the corner and then closer in again. \n\n"Well, at last I've finished, now I'll rest," \nthought the prince, and let Tikhon undress him. \n\nFrowning with vexation at the effort neces- \nsary to divest himself of his coat and trousers, \nthe prince undressed, sat down heavily on the \nbed, and appeared to be meditating as he \nlooked contemptuously at his withered yellow \nlegs. He was not meditating, but only defer- \nring the moment of making the effort to lift \nthose legs up and turn over on the bed. "Ugh, \nhow hard it is! Oh, that this toil might end and \n\n\n\nyou would release me!" thought he. Pressing \nhis lips together he made that effort for the \ntwenty- thousandth time and lay down. But \nhardly had he done so before he felt the bed \nrocking backwards and forwards beneath him \nas if it were breathing heavily and jolting. This \nhappened to him almost every night. He \nopened his eyes as they were closing. \n\n"No peace, damn them!" he muttered, an- \ngry he knew not with whom. "Ah yes, there was \nsomething else important, very important, \nthat I was keeping till I should be in bed. The \nbolts? No, I told him about them. No, it was \nsomething, something in the drawing room. \nPrincess Mary talked some nonsense. Dessalles, \nthat fool, said something. Something in my \npocketcan't remember. . . . \n\n"Tikhon, what did we talk about at dinner?" \n\n"About Prince Michael . . ." \n\n"Be quiet, quiet!" The prince slapped his \nhand on the table. "Yes, I know, Prince An- \ndrew's letter! Princess Mary read it. Dessalles \nsaid something about Vitebsk. Now I'll read \nit." \n\nHe had the letter taken from his pocket \nand the table on which stood a glass of lem- \nonade and a spiral wax handle moved close \nto the bed, and putting on his spectacles he \nbegan reading. Only now in the stillness of the \nnight, reading it by the faint light under the \ngreen shade, did he grasp its meaning for a \nmoment. \n\n"The French at Vitebsk, in four days' march \nthey may be at Smolensk; perhaps are already \nthere! Tikhon!" Tfkhon jumped up. "No, no, \nI don't want anything!" he shouted. \n\nHe put the letter under the candlestick and \nclosed his eyes. And there rose before him the \nDanube at bright noonday: reeds, the Russian \ncamp, and himself a young general without a \nwrinkle on his ruddy face, vigorous and alert, \nentering Potemkin's gaily colored tent, and a \nburning sense of jealousy of "the favorite" agi- \ntated him now as strongly as it had done then. \nHe recalled all the words spoken at that first \nmeeting with Potemkin. And he saw before \nhim a plump, rather sallow-faced, short, stout \nwoman, the Empress Mother, with her smile \nand her words at her first gracious reception of \nhim, and then that same face on the catafalque, \nand the encounter he had with Ztibov over her \ncoffin about his right to kiss her hand. \n\n"Oh, quicker, quicker! To get back to that \ntime and have done with all the present! Quick- \ner, quicker and that they should leave me in \npeacel" \n\n\n\nBOOK \n\nCHAPTER IV \n\nBALD HILLS, Prince Nicholas Bolk6nski's es- \ntate, lay forty miles east from Smolensk and \ntwo miles from the main road to Moscow. \n\nThe same evening that the prince gave his \ninstructions to Alpatych, Dessalles, having \nasked to see Princess Mary, told her that, as the \nprince was not very well and was taking no steps \nto secure his safety, though from Prince An- \ndrew's letter it was evident that to remain at \nBald Hills might be dangerous, he respectfully \nadvised her to send a letter by Alpatych to the \nProvincial Governor at Smolensk, asking him . \nto let her know the state of affairs and the ex- \ntent of the danger to which Bald Hills was ex- \nposed. Dessalles wrote this letter to the Gover- \nnor for Princess Mary, she signed it, and it was \ngiven to Alpatych with instructions to hand it \nto the Governor and to come back as quickly \nas possible if there was danger. \n\nHaving received all his orders Alpdtych, wear- \ning a white beaver hat a present from the \nprince and carrying a stick as the prince did, \nwent out accompanied by his family. Three \nwell-fed roans stood ready harnessed to a small \nconveyance with a leather hood. \n\nThe larger bell was muffled and the little bells \non the harness stuffed with paper. The prince \nallowed no one at Bald Hills to drivewith ring- \ning bells, but on a long journey Alpatych liked \nto have them. His satellites the senior clerk, \na countinghouse clerk, a scullery maid, a cook, \ntwo old women, a little pageboy, the coachman, \nand various domestic serfs were seeing him \noff. \n\nHis daughter placed chintz-covered down \ncushions for him to sit on and behind his back. \nHis old sister-in-law popped in a small bundle, \nand one of the coachmen helped him into the \nvehicle. \n\n"There! There! Women's fuss! Women, \nwomen!" said Alpatych, puffing and speaking \nrapidly just as the prince did, and he climbed \ninto the trap. \n\nAfter giving the clerk orders about the work \nto be done, Alpatych, not trying to imitate the \nprince now, lifted the hat from his bald head \nand crossed himself three times. \n\n"If there is anything . . . come back, Ydkov \nAlpdtych! For Christ's sake think of us!" cried \nhis wife, referring to the rumors of war and the \nenemy. \n\n"Women, women! Women's fuss!" muttered \nAlpdtych to himself and started on his journey, \nlooking round at the fields of yellow rye and \nthe still-green, thickly growing oats, and at oth- \n\n\n\nTEN 395 \n\ner quite black fields just being plowed a second \ntime. \n\nAs he went along he looked with pleasure \nat the year's splendid crop of corn, scrutinized \nthe strips of ryefield which here and there were \nalready being reaped, made his calculations as \nto the sowing and the harvest, and asked him- \nself whether he had not forgotten any of the \nprince's orders. \n\nHaving baited the horses twice on the way, \nhe arrived at the town toward evening on the \nfourth of August. \n\nAlpatych kept meeting and overtaking bag- \ngage trains and troops on the road. As he ap- \nproached Smolensk he heard the sounds of dis- \ntant firing, but these did not impress him. \nWhat struck him most was the sight of a splen- \ndid field of oats in which a camp had been \npitched and which was being mown down by \nthe soldiers, evidently for fodder. This fact \nimpressed Alpdtych, but in thinking about his \nown business he soon forgot it. \n\nAll the interests of his life for more than \nthirty years had been bounded by the will of \nthe prince, and he never went beyond that \nlimit. Everything not connected with the exe- \ncution of the prince's orders did not interest \nand did not even exist for Alpdtych. \n\nOn reaching Smolensk on the evening of \nthe fourth of August he put up in the Gdchina \nsuburb across the Dnieper, at the inn kept by \nFerap6ntov, where he had been in the habit of \nputting up for the last thirty years. Some thirty \nyears ago Ferap6ntov, by Alpatych's advice, had \nbought a wood from the prince, had begun to \ntrade, and now had a house, an inn, and a corn \ndealer's shop in that province. He was a stout, \ndark, red-faced peasant in the forties, with \nthick lips, a broad knob of a nose, similar knobs \nover his black frowning brows, and a round \nbelly. \n\nWearing a waistcoat over his cotton shirt, \nFerap6ntov was standing before his shop which \nopened onto the street. On seeing Alpatych he \nwent up to him. \n\n"You're welcome, Ydkov Alpdtych. Folks are \nleaving the town, but you have come to it," \nsaid he. \n\n"Why are they leaving the town?" asked Al- \nptych. \n\n"That's what I say. Folks are foolish! Always \nafraid of the French." \n\n"Women's fuss, women's fuss!" said Alpdtych. \n\n"Just what I think, Ydkov Alpdtych. What I \nsay is: orders have been given not to let them in, \nso that must be right. And the peasants are ask- \n\n\n\n396 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\ning three rubles for carting it isn't Christian!" \n\nYakov Alpdtych heard without heeding. He \nasked for a samovar and for hay for his horses, \nand when he had had his tea he went to bed. \n\nAll night long troops were moving past the \ninn. Next morning Alpdtych donned a jacket \nhe wore only in town and went out on business. \nIt was a sunny morning and by eight o'clock \nit was already hot. "A good day for harvesting," \nthought Alpatych. \n\nFrom beyond the town firing had been heard \nsince earlymorning. At eight o'clock the boom- \ning of cannon was added to the sound of mus- \nketry. Many people were hurrying through the \nstreets and there were many soldiers, but cabs \nwere still driving about, tradesmen stood at \ntheir shops, and service was being held in the \nchurches as usual. Alpitych went to the shops, \nto government offices, to the post office, and to \nthe Governor's. In the offices and shops and at \nthe post office everyone was talking about the \narmy and about the enemy who was already at- \ntacking the town, everybody was asking what \nshould be done, and all were trying to calm one \nanother. \n\nIn front of the Governor's house Alpitych \nfound a large number of people, Cossacks, and \na traveling carriage of the Governor's. At the \nporch he met two of the landed gentry, one of \nwhom he knew. This man, an ex-captain of \npolice, was saying angrily: \n\n"It's no joke, you know! It's all very well if \nyou're single. 'One man though undone is but \none/ as the proverb says, but with thirteen in \nyour family and all the property . . . They've \nbrought us to utter ruin! What sort of gover- \nnors are they to do that? They ought to be \nhanged the brigands! . . ." \n\n"Oh come, that's enough!" said the other. \n\n"What do I care? Let him hear! We're not \ndogs," said the ex-captain of police, and look- \ning round he noticed Alpdtych. \n\n"Oh, Ydkov Alpatych! What have you come \nfor?" \n\n"To see the Governor by his excellency's or- \nder," answered Alpdtych, lifting his head and \nproudly thrusting his hand into the bosom of \nhis coat as he always did when he mentioned \n\nthe prince "He has ordered me to inquire \n\ninto the position of affairs," he added. \n\n"Yes, go and find out!" shouted the angry \ngentleman. "They've brought things to such a \npass that there are no carts or anything! . . . \nThere it is again, do you hear?" said he, point- \ning in the direction whence came the sounds of \nfiring. \n\n\n\n"They've brought us all to ruin . . . the brig- \nands!" he repeated, and descended the porch \nsteps. \n\nAlpatych swayed his head and went upstairs. \nIn the waiting room were tradesmen, women, \nand officials, looking silently at one another. \nThe door of the Governor's room opened and \nthey all rose and moved forward. An official \nran out, said some words to a merchant, called \na stout official with a cross hanging on his neck \nto follow him, and vanished again, evidently \nwishing to avoid the inquiring looks and ques- \ntions addressed to him. Alpatych moved for- \nward and next time the official came out ad- \ndressed him, one hand placed in the breast of \nhis buttoned coat, and handed him two letters. \n\n"To his Honor Baron Asch, from General-in- \nChief Prince Bolk6nski," he announced with \nsuch solemnity and significance that the official \nturned to him and took the letters. \n\nA few minutes later the Governor received \nAlpatych and hurriedly said to him: \n\n"Inform the prince and princess that I knew \nnothing: I acted on the highest instructions \nhere . . ." and he handed a paper to Alpdtych. \n"Still, as the prince is unwell my advice is that \nthey should go to Moscow. I am just starting \nmyself. Inform them ..." \n\nBut the Governor did not finish: a dusty per- \nspiring officer ran into the room and began to \nsay something in French. The Governor's face \nexpressed terror. \n\n"Go," he said, nodding his head to Alpdtych, \nand began questioning the officer. \n\nEager, frightened, helpless glances were \nturned on Alpdtych when he came out of the \nGovernor's room. Involuntarily listening now \nto the firing, which had drawn nearer and was \nincreasing in strength, Alpdtych hurried to his \ninn. The paper handed to him by the Govern- \nor said this: \n\n"I assure you that the town of Smolensk is not \nin the slightest danger as yet and it is unlikely that \nit will be threatened with any. I from the one side \nand Prince Bagrati6n from the other are marching \nto unite our forces before Smolensk, which junction \nwill be effected on the 22nd instant, and both ar- \nmies with their united forces will defend our com- \npatriots of the province entrusted to your care till \nour efforts shall have beaten back the enemies of \nour Fatherland, or till the last warrior in our val- \niant ranks has perished. From this you will see that \nyou have a perfect right to reassure the inhabitants \nof Smolensk, for those defended by two such brave \narmies may feel assured of victory." (Instructions \nfrom Barclay de Tolly to Baron Asch, the civil \ngovernor of Smolensk, 1812.) \n\n\n\nBOOK TEN \n\n\n\n397 \n\n\n\nPeople were anxiously roaming about the \nstreets. \n\nCarts piled high with household utensils, \nchairs, and cupboards kept emerging from the \ngates of the yards and moving along the streets. \nLoaded carts stood at the house next to Fera- \np6ntov's and women were wailing and lament- \ning as they said good-by. A small watchdog \nran round barking in front of the harnessed \nhorses. \n\nAlpdtych entered the innyard at a quicker \npace than usual and went straight to the shed \nwhere his horses and trap were. The coachman \nwas asleep. He woke him up, told him to har- \nness, and went into the passage. From the host's \nroom came the sounds of a child crying, the de- \nspairing sobs of a woman, and the hoarse an- \ngry shouting of Ferap6ntov. The cook began \nrunning hither and thither in the passage like \na frightened hen, just as Alpdtych entered. \n\n"He's done her to death. Killed the mistressl \n. . . Beat her . . . dragged her about so! ..." \n\n"What for?" asked Alpdtych. \n\n"She kept begging to go away. She's a wom- \nan! 'Take me away,' says she, 'don't let me \nperish with my little children! Folks,' she says, \n'are all gone, so why,' she says, 'don't we go?' \nAnd he began beating and pulling her about \nso!" \n\nAt these words Alpdtych nodded as if in ap- \nproval, and not wishing to hear more went to \nthe door of the room opposite the innkeeper's, \nwhere he had left his purchases. \n\n"You brute, you murderer! "screamed a thin, \npale woman who, with a baby in her arms and \nher kerchief torn from her head, burst through \nthe door at that moment and down the steps \ninto the yard. \n\nFerap6ntov came out after her, but on see- \ning Alpdtych adjusted his waistcoat, smoothed \nhis hair, yawned, and followed Alpatych into \nthe opposite room. \n\n"Going already?" said he. \n\nAlpdtych, without answering or looking at \nhis host, sorted his packages and asked how \nmuch he owed. \n\n"We'll reckon up! Well, have you been to \nthe Governor's?" asked Ferap6ntov. "What has \nbeen decided?" \n\nAlpdtych replied that the Governor had not \ntold him anything definite. \n\n"With our business, how can we get away?" \nsaid Ferap6ntov. "We'd have to pay seven ru- \nbles a cartload to Dorogobuzh and I tell them \nthey're not Christians to ask iti Selivdnov, now, \ndid a good stroke last Thursdaysold flour to \n\n\n\nthe army at nine rubles a sack. Will you have \nsome tea?" he added. \n\nWhile the horses were being harnessed Al- \npatych and Ferap6ntov over their tea talked of \nthe price of corn, the crops, and the good weath- \ner for harvesting. \n\n"Well, it seems to be getting quieter," re- \nmarked Ferap6ntov, finishing his third cup of \ntea and getting up. "Ours must have got the \nbest of it. The orders were not to let them in. \nSo we're in force, it seems. . . . They say the \nother day Matthew Ivdnych Pldtov * drove them \ninto the river Mdrina and drowned some eight- \neen thousand in one day." \n\nAlpjitych collected his parcels, handed them \nto the coachman who had come in, and settled \nup with the innkeeper. The noise of wheels, \nhoofs, and bells was heard from the gateway as \na little trap passed out. \n\nIt was by now late in the afternoon. Half \nthe street was in shadow, the other half bright- \nly lit by the sun. Alpatych looked out of the \nwindow and went to the door. Suddenly the \nstrange sound of a far-off whistling and thud \nwas heard, followed by a boom of cannon blend- \ning into a dull roar that set the windows rat- \ntling. \n\nHe went out into the street: two men were \nrunning past toward the bridge. From different \nsides came whistling sounds and the thud of \ncannon balls and bursting shells falling on the \ntown. But these sounds were hardly heard in \ncomparison with the noise of the firing outside \nthe town and attracted little attention from \nthe inhabitants. The town was being bombard- \ned by a hundred and thirty guns which Napo- \nleon had ordered up after four o'clock. The \npeople did not at once realize the meaning of \nthis bombardment. \n\nAt first the noise of the falling bombs and \nshells only aroused curiosity. Ferap6ntov's \nwife, who till then had not ceased wailing un- \nder the shed, became quiet and with the baby \nin her arms went to the gate, listening to the \nsounds and looking in silence at the people. \n\nThe cook and a shop assistant came to the \ngate. With lively curiosity everyone tried to \nget a glimpse of the projectiles as they flew \nover their heads. Several people came round \nthe corner talking eagerly. \n\n"What force!" remarked one. "Knocked the \nroof and ceiling all to splinters!" \n\n"Routed up the earth like a pig," said an- \nother. \n\n"That's grand, it bucks one up!" laughed \n\n1 Hetman of the Cossack army. TR. \n\n\n\n398 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nthe first. "Lucky you jumped aside, or it would \nhave wiped you out!" \n\nOthers joined those men and stopped and \ntold how cannon balls had fallen on a house \nclose to them. Mean while still more projectiles, \nnow with the swift sinister whistle of a cannon \nball, now with the agreeable intermittent whis- \ntle of a shell, flew over people's heads incessant- \nly, but not one fell close by, they all flew over. \nAlpdtych was getting into his trap. The inn- \nkeeper stood at the gate. \n\n"What are you staring at?" he shouted to the \ncook, who in her red skirt, with sleeves rolled \nup, swinging her bare elbows, had stepped to \nthe corner to listen to what was being said. \n\n"What marvels!" she exclaimed, but hearing \nher master's voice she turned back, pulling \ndown her tucked-up skirt. \n\nOnce moresomethingwhistled, but this time \nquite close, swooping downwards like a little \nbird; a flame flashed in the middle of the street, \nsomething exploded, and the street was shroud- \ned in smoke. \n\n"Scoundrel, what are you doing?" shouted \nthe innkeeper, rushing to the cook. \n\nAt that moment the pitiful wailing of wom- \nen was heard from different sides, the fright- \nened baby began to cry, and people crowded \nsilently with pale faces round the cook. The \nloudest sound in that crowd was her wailing. \n\n"Oh-h-h! Dear souls, dear kind souls! Don't \nlet me die! My good souls! . . ." \n\nFive minutes later no one remained in the \nstreet. The cook, with her thigh broken by a \nshell splinter, had been carried into the kitch- \nen. Alpdtych, his coachman, Ferap6ntov's wife \nand children and the house porter were all sit- \nting in the cellar, listening. The roar of guns, \nthe whistling of projectiles, and the piteous \nmoaning of the cook, which rose above the oth- \ner sounds, did not cease fora moment. The mis- \ntress rocked and hushed her baby and when \nanyone came into the cellar asked in a pathetic \nwhisper what had become of her husband who \nhad remained in the street. A shopman who \nentered told her that her husband had gone \nwith others to the cathedral, whence they were \nfetching the wonder-working icon of Smolensk. \n\nToward dusk the cannonade began to sub- \nside. Alpdtych left the cellar and stopped in the \ndoorway. The evening sky that had been so \nclear was clouded with smoke, through which, \nhigh up, the sickle of the new moon shone \nstrangely. Now that the terrible din of the guns \nhad ceased a hush seemed to reign over the \ntown, broken only by the rustle of footsteps, \n\n\n\nthe moaning, the distant cries, and the crackle \nof fires which seemed widespread everywhere. \nThe cook's moans had now subsided. On two \nsides black curling clouds of smoke rose and \nspread from the fires. Through the streets sol- \ndiers in various uniforms walked or ran con- \nfusedly in different directions like ants from a \nruined ant-hill. Several of them ran into Fera- \npontov's yard before Alpdtych's eyes. Alpdtych \nwent out to the gate. A retreating regiment, \nthronging and hurrying, blocked the street. \n\nNoticing him, an officer said: "The town is \nbeing abandoned. Get away, get away!" and \nthen, turning to the soldiers, shouted: \n\n"I'll teach you to run into the yards!" \n\nAlpdtych went back to the house, called the \ncoachman, and told him to set off. Ferap6ntov's \nwhole household came out too, following Al- \npdtych and the coachman. The women, who \nhad been silent till then, suddenly began to \nwail as they looked at the fires the smoke and \neven the flames of which could be seen in the \nfailing twilight and as if in reply the same \nkind of lamentation was heard from other parts \nof the street. Inside the shed Alpdtych and the \ncoachman arranged the tangled reins and traces \nof their horses with trembling hands. \n\nAs Alpdtych was driving out of the gate he \nsaw some ten soldiers in Ferapontov's open \nshop, talking loudly and filling their bags and \nknapsacks with flour and sunflower seeds. Just \nthen Ferapontov returned and entered his shop. \nOn seeing the soldiers he was about to shout \nat them, but suddenly stopped and, clutching \nat his hair, burst into sobs and laughter: \n\n"Loot everything, lads! Don't let those devils \nget it!" he cried, taking some bags of flour him- \nself and throwing them into the street. \n\nSome of the soldiers were frightened and ran \naway, others went on filling their bags. On see- \ning Alpdtych, FerapcSntov turned to him: \n\n"Russia is done for!" he cried. "Alpdtych, \nI'll set the place on fire myself. We're done \nfor! . . ." and Ferap6ntov ran into the yard. \n\nSoldiers were passing in a constant stream \nalong the street blocking it completely, so that \nAlpdtych could not pass out and had to wait. \nFerap6ntov's wife and children were also sit- \nting in a cart waiting till it was possible to drive \nout. \n\nNight had come. There were stars in the sky \nand the new moon shone out amid the smoke \nthat screened it. On the sloping descent to the \nDnieper Alpdtych's cart and that of the inn- \nkeeper's wife, which were slowly moving amid \nthe rows of soldiers and of other vehicles, had \n\n\n\nBOOK TEN \n\n\n\n399 \n\n\n\nto stop. In a side street near the crossroads \nwhere the vehicles had stopped, a house ariti \nsome shops were on fire. This fire was already \nburning itself out. The flames now died down \nand were lost in the black smoke, now sudden- \nly flared up again brightly, lighting up with \nstrange distinctness the faces of the people \ncrowding at the crossroads. Black figures flit- \nted about before the fire, and through the in- \ncessant crackling of the flames talking and \nshouting could be heard. Seeing that his trap \nwould not be able to move on for some time, \nAlpdtych got down and turned into the side \nstreet to look at the fire. Soldiers were contin- \nually rushing backwards and forwards near it, \nand he saw two of them and a man in a frieze \ncoat dragging burning beams in to another yard \nacross the street, while others carried bundles \nof hay. \n\nAlpdtych went up to a large crowd standing \nbefore a high barn which was blazing briskly. \nThe walls were all on fire and the back wall had \nfallen in, the wooden roof was collapsing, and \nthe rafters were alight. The crowd was evident- \nly watching for thereof to fall in, and Alpdtych \nwatched for it too. \n\n"Alpatych!" a familiar voice suddenly hailed \nthe old man. \n\n"Mercy on us! Your excellency!" answered \nAlpatych, immediately recognizing the voice \nof his young prince. \n\nPrince Andrew in his riding cloak, mounted \non a black horse, was looking at Alpatych from \nthe back of the crowd. \n\n"Why are you here?" he asked. \n\n"Your . . . your excellency," stammered Al- \npdtych and broke into sobs. "Are we really \nlost? Master! . . ." \n\n"Why are you here?" Prince Andrew repeat- \ned. \n\nAt that moment the flames flared up and \nshowed his young master's pale worn face. Al- \npdtych told how he had been sent there and \nhow difficult it was to get away. \n\n"Are we really quite lost, your excellency?" \nhe asked again. \n\nPrince Andrew without replying took out \na notebook and raising his knee began writing \nin pencil on a page he tore out. He wrote to \nhis sister: \n\n"Smolensk is being abandoned. Bald Hills will \nbe occupied by the enemy within a week. Set off \nimmediately for Moscow. Let me know at once \nwhen you will start. Send by special messenger to \nUsvydzh." \n\nHaving written this and given the paper to \n\n\n\nAlpdtych, he told him how to arrange for the \ndeparture of the prince, the princess, his son, \nand the boy's tutor, and how and where to let \nhim know immediately. Before he had had time \nto finish giving these instructions, a chief of \nstaff followed by a suite galloped up to him. \n\n"You are a colonel?" shouted the chief of \nstaff with a German accent, in a voice familiar \nto Prince Andrew. "Houses are set on fire in \nyour presence and you stand by! What does \nthis mean? You will answer for it!" shouted \nBerg, who was now assistant to the chief of \nstaff of the commander of the left flank of the \ninfantry of the first army, a place, as Berg said, \n"very agreeable and well en Evidence." \n\nPrince Andrew looked at him and without \nreplying went on speaking to Alpdtych. \n\n"So tell them that I shall await a reply till \nthe tenth, and if by the tenth I don't receive \nnews that they have all got away I shall have to \nthrow up everything and come myself to Bald \nHills." \n\n"Prince," said Berg, recognizing Prince An- \ndrew, "I only spoke because I have to obey or- \nders, because I always do obey exactly You \n\nmust please excuse me," he went on apologet- \nically. \n\nSomething cracked in the flames. The fire \ndied down for a moment and wreaths of black \nsmoke rolled from under the roof. There was \nanother terrible crash and something huge col- \nlapsed. \n\n"Ou-rou-rou!" yelled the crowd, echoing the \ncrash of the collapsing roof of the barn, the \nburning grain in which diffused a cakelike \naroma all around. The flames flared up again, \nlighting the animated, delighted, exhausted \nfaces of the spectators. \n\nThe man in the frieze coat raised his arms \nand shouted: \n\n"It's fine, lads! Now it's raging . . . It's fine!" \n\n"That's the owner himself," cried several \nvoices. \n\n"Well then," continued Prince Andrew to \nAlpdtych, "report to them as I have told you"; \nand not replying a word to Berg who was now \nmute beside him, he touched his horse and rode \ndown the side street. \n\nCHAPTER V \n\nFROM SMOLENSK the troops continued to re- \ntreat, followed by the enemy. On the tenth of \nAugust the regiment Prince Andrew command- \ned was marching along the highroad past the \navenue leading to Bald Hills. Heat and drought \nhad continued for more than three weeks. \n\n\n\n4&lt;x&gt; \n\nEach day fleecy clouds floated across the sky \nand occasionally veiled the sun, but toward \nevening the sky cleared again and the sun set \nin reddish-brown mist. Heavy night dews alone \nrefreshed the earth. The unreaped corn was \nscorched and shed its grain. The marshes dried \nup. The cattle lowed from hunger, finding no \nfood on the sun-parched meadows. Only at \nnight and in the forests while the dew lasted \nwas there any freshness. But on the road, the \nhighroad along which the troops marched, \nthere was no such freshness even at night or \nwhen the road passed through the forest; the \ndew was imperceptible on the sandy dust \nchurned up more than six inches deep. As soon \nas day dawned the march began. The artillery \nand baggage wagons moved noiselessly through \nthe deep dust that rose to the very hubs of the \nwheels, and the infantry sank ankle-deep in \nthat soft, choking, hot dust that never cooled \neven at night. Some of this dust was kneaded \nby the feet and wheels, while the rest rose and \nhung like a cloud over the troops, settling in \neyes, ears, hair, and nostrils, and worst of all in \nthe lungs of the men and beasts as they moved \nalong that road. The higher the sun rose the \nhigher rose that cloud of dust, and through the \nscreen of its hot fine particles one could look \nwith naked eye at the sun, which showed like \na huge crimson ball in the unclouded sky. \nThere was no wind, and the men choked in \nthat motionless atmosphere. They marched \nwith handkerchiefs tied over their noses and \nmouths. When they passed through a village \nthey all rushed to the wells and fought for the \nwater and drank 't down to the mud. \n\nPrince Andrew was in command of a regi- \nment, and the management of that regiment, \nthe welfare of the men and the necessity of re- \nceiving and giving orders, engrossed him. The \nburning of Smolensk and its abandonment \nmade an epoch in his life. A novel feeling of \nanger against the foe made him forget his own \nsorrow. He was entirely devoted to the affairs \nof his regiment and was considerate and kind \nto his men and officers. In the regiment they \ncalled him "our prince," were proud of him \nand loved him. But he was kind and gentle on- \nly to those of his regiment, to Tim6khin and \nthe like people quite new to him, belonging \nto a different world and who could not know \nand understand his past. As soon as he came \nacross a former acquaintance or anyone from \nthe staff, he bristled up immediately and grew \nspiteful, ironical, and contemptuous. Every- \nthing that reminded him of his past was repug- \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\nnant to him, and so in his relations with that \nfdriner circle he confined himself to trying to \ndo his duty and not to be unfair. \n\nIn truth everything presented itself in a dark \nand gloomy light to Prince Andrew, especially \nafter the abandonment of Smolensk on the \nsixth of August (he considered that it could \nand should have been defended) and after his \nsick father had had to flee to Moscow, abandon- \ning to pillage his dearly beloved Bald Hills \nwhich he had built and peopled. But despite \nthis, thanks to his regiment, Prince Andrew had \nsomething to think about entirely apart from \ngeneral questions. Two days previously he had \nreceived news that his father, son, and sister \nhad left for Moscow; and though there was \nnothing for him to do at Bald Hills, Prince An- \ndrew with a characteristic desire to foment his \nown grief decided that he must ride there. \n\nHe ordered his horse to be saddled and, leav- \ning his regiment on the march, rode to his fa- \nther's estate where he had been born and spent \nhis childhood. Riding past the pond where \nthere used always to be dozens of women chat- \ntering as they rinsed their linen or beat it with \nwooden beetles, Prince Andrew noticed that \nthere was not a soul about and that the little \nwashing wharf, torn from its place and half sub- \nmerged, was floating on its side in the middle \nof the pond. He rode to the keeper's lodge. No \none was at the stone entrance gates of the drive \nand the door stood open. Grass had already be- \ngun to grow on the garden paths, and horses \nand calves were straying in the English park. \nPrince Andrew rode up to the hothouse; some \nof the glass panes were broken, and of the trees \nin tubs some were overturned and others dried \nup. He called for Tards the gardener, but no \none replied. Having gone round the corner of \nthe hothouse to the ornamental garden, he saw \nthat the carved garden fence was broken and \nbranches of the plum trees had been torn off \nwith the fruit. An old peasant whom Prince \nAndrew in his childhood had often seen at the \ngate was sitting on a green garden seat, plait- \ning a bast shoe. \n\nHe was deaf and did not hear Prince Andrew \nride up. He was sitting on the seat the old \nprince used to like to sit on, and beside him \nstrips of bast were hanging on the broken and \nwithered branch of a magnolia. \n\nPrince Andrew rode up to the house. Sev- \neral limes in the old garden had been cut down \nand a piebald mare and her foal were wander- \ning in front of the house among the rosebushes. \nThe shutters were all closed, except at one \n\n\n\nBOOK TEN \n\n\n\n401 \n\n\n\nwindow which was open. A little serf boy, see- \ning Prince Andrew, ran into the house. Al- \npdtych, having sent his family away, was alone \nat Bald Hills and was sitting indoors reading \nthe Lives of the Saints. On hearing that Prince \nAndrew had come, he went out with his spec- \ntacles on his nose, buttoning his coat, and, hast- \nily stepping up, without a word began weeping \nand kissing Prince Andrew's knee. \n\nThen, vexed at his own weakness, he turned \naway and began to report on the position of af- \nfairs. Everything precious and valuable had \nbeen removed to Bogucharovo. Seventy quar- \nters of grain had also been carted away. The \nhay and the spring corn, of which Alpdtych \nsaid there had been a remarkable crop that \nyear, had been commandeered by the troops \nand mown down while still green. The peas- \nants were ruined; some of them too had gone \nto Bogucharovo, only a few remained. \n\nWithout waiting to hear him out, Prince An- \ndrew asked: \n\n"When did my father and sister leave?" \nmeaning when did they leave for Moscow. \n\nAlpatych, understanding the question to re- \nfer to their departure for Boguchdrovo, re- \nplied that they had left on the seventh and \nagain went into details concerning the estate \nmanagement, asking for instructions. \n\n"Am I to let the troops have the oats, and to \ntake a receipt for them? We have still six hun- \ndred quarters left," he inquired. \n\n"What am I to say to him?" thought Prince \nAndrew, looking down on the old man's bald \nhead shining in the sun and seeing by the ex- \npression on his face that the old man himself \nunderstood how untimely such questions were \nand only asked them to allay his grief. \n\n"Yes, let them have it," replied Prince An- \ndrew. \n\n"If you noticed some disorder in the garden," \nsaid Alpdtych, "it was impossible to prevent it. \nThree regiments have been here and spent the \nnight, dragoons mostly. I took down the name \nand rank of their commanding officer, to hand \nin a complaint about it." \n\n"Well, and what are you going to do? Will \nyou stay here if the enemy occupies the place?" \nasked Prince Andrew. \n\nAlpdtych turned his face to Prince Andrew, \nlooked at him, and suddenly with a solemn \ngesture raised his arm. \n\n"He is my refuge! His will be donel" he ex- \nclaimed. \n\nA group of bareheaded peasants was ap- \nproaching across the meadow toward the prince. \n\n\n\n"Well, good-byl" said Prince Andrew, bend- \ning over to Alpdtych. "You must go away too, \ntake away what you can and tell the serfs to go \nto the Ryazdn estate or to the one near Mos- \ncow." \n\nAlpdtych clung to Prince Andrew's leg and \nburst into sobs. Gently disengaging himself, \nthe prince spurred his horse and rode down the \navenue at a gallop. \n\nThe old man was still sitting in the orna- \nmental garden, like a fly impassive on the face \nof a loved one who is dead, tapping the last on \nwhich he was making the bast shoe, and two \nlittlegirls, running out from the hothouse carry- \ning in their skirts plums they had plucked from \nthe trees there, came upon Prince Andrew. On \nseeing the young master, the elder one with \nfrightened look clutched her younger compan- \nion by the hand and hid with her behind a birch \ntree, not stopping to pick up some green plums \nthey had dropped. \n\nPrince Andrew turned away with startled \nhaste, unwilling to let them see that they had \nbeen observed. He was sorry for the pretty \nfrightened little girl, was afraid of looking at \nher, and yet felt an irresistible desire to do so. \nA new sensation of comfort and relief came \nover him when, seeing these girls, he realized \nthe existence of other human interests entirely \naloof from his own and just as legitimate as \nthose that occupied him. Evidently these girls \npassionately desired one thing to carry away \nand eat those green plums without being caught \nand Prince Andrew shared their wish for the \nsuccess of their enterprise. He could not resist \nlooking at them once more. Believing their \ndanger past, they sprang from their ambush \nand, chirruping something in their shrill little \nvoices and holding up their skirts, their bare \nlittle sunburned feet scampered merrily and \nquickly across the meadow grass. \n\nPrince Andrew was somewhat refreshed by \nhaving ridden off the dusty highroad along \nwhich the troops were moving. But not far \nfrom Bald Hills he again came out on the road \nand overtook his regiment at its halting place \nby the dam of a small pond. It was past one \no'clock. The sun, a red ball through the dust, \nburned and scorched his back intolerably \nthrough his black coat. The dust always hung \nmotionless above the buzz of talk that came \nfrom the resting troops. There was no wind. \nAs he crossed the dam Prince Andrew smelled \nthe ooze and freshness of the pond. He longed \nto get into that water, however dirty it might \nbe, and he glanced round at the pool from \n\n\n\n40? \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nwhence came sounds of shrieks and laughter. \nThe small, muddy, green pond had risen vis- \nibly more than a foot, flooding the dam, be- \ncause it was full of the naked white bodies of \nsoldiers with brick-red hands, necks, and faces, \nwho were splashing about in it. All this naked \nwhite human flesh, laughing and shrieking, \nfloundered about in that dirty pool like carp \nstuffed into a watering can, and the suggestion \nof merriment in that floundering mass rendered \nit specially pathetic. \n\nOne fair-haired young soldier of the third \ncompany, whom Prince Andrew knew and \nwho had a strap round the calf of one leg, \ncrossed himself, stepped back to get a good run, \nand plunged into the water; another, a dark \nnoncommissioned officer who was always shag- \ngy, stood up to his waist in the water joyfully \nwriggling his muscular figure and snorted with \nsatisfaction as he poured the water over his \nhead with hands blackened to the wrists. There \nwere sounds of men slapping one another, \nyelling, and puffing. \n\nEverywhere on the bank, on the dam, and \nin the pond, there was healthy, white, muscu- \nlar flesh. The officer, Tim6khin, with his red \nlittle nose, standing on the dam wiping himself \nwith a towel, felt confused at seeing the prince, \nbut made up his mind to address him neverthe- \nless. \n\n"It's very nice, your excellency! Wouldn't \nyou like to?" said he. \n\n"It's dirty," replied Prince Andrew, making \na grimace. \n\n"We'll clear it out for you in a minute," said \nTim6khin, and, still undressed, ran off to clear \nthe men out of the pond. \n\n"The prince wants to bathe." \n\n"What prince? Ours?" said many voices, and \nthe men were in such haste to clear out that the \nprince could hardly stop them. He decided that \nhe would rather souse himself with water in the \nbarn. \n\n"Flesh, bodies, cannon fodder!" he thought, \nand he looked at his own naked body and shud- \ndered, not from cold but from a sense of dis- \ngust and horror he did not himself understand, \naroused by the sight of that immense number \nof bodies splashing about in the dirty pond. \n\nOn the seventh of August Prince Bagrati6n \nwrote as follows from his quarters at Mikhay- \nlovka on the Smolensk road: \n\nDear Count Alexis Andrevich (He was writ- \ning to Arakche'ev but knew that his letter would be \nread by the Emperor, and therefore weighed every \n\n\n\nword in it to the best of his ability.) \n\nI expect the Minister [Barclay de Tolly] has al- \nready reported the abandonment of Smolensk to \nthe enemy. It is pitiable and sad, and the whole \narmy is in despair that this most important place \nhas been wantonly abandoned. I, for my part, \nbegged him personally most urgently and finally \nwrote him, but nothing would induce him to con- \nsent. I swear to you on my honor that Napoleon \nwas in such a fix as never before and might have \nlost half his army but could not have taken Smo- \nle"nsk. Our troops fought, and are fighting, as \nnever before. With fifteen thousand men I held \nthe enemy at bay for thirty-five hours and beat \nhim; but he would not hold out even for fourteen \nhours. It is disgraceful, a stain on our army, and \nas for him, he ought, it seems to me, not to live. If \nhe reports that our losses were great, it is not true; \nperhaps about four thousand, not more, and not \neven that; but even were they ten thousand, that's \nwar! But the enemy has lost masses. . . . \n\nWhat would it have cost him to hold out for \nanother two days? They would have had to retire \nof their own accord, for they had no water for men \nor horses. He gave me his word he would not re- \ntreat, but suddenly sent instructions that he was \nretiring that night. We cannot fight in this way, \nor we may soon bring the enemy to Moscow. . . . \n\nThere is a rumor that you are thinking of peace. \nGod forbid that you should make peace after all \nour sacrifices and such insane retreats! You would \nset all Russia against you and every one of us \nwould feel ashamed to wear the uniform. If it has \ncome to this we must fight as long as Russia can \nand as long as there are men able to stand. . . . \n\nOne man ought to be in command, and not two. \nYour Minister may perhaps be good as a Minister, \nbut as a general he is not merely bad but execra- \nble, yet to him is entrusted the fate of our whole \ncountry. ... I am really frantic with vexation; for- \ngive my writing boldly. It is clear that the man \nwho advocates the conclusion of a peace, and that \nthe Minister should command the army, does not \nlove our sovereign and desires the ruin of us all. \nSo I write you frankly: call out the militia. For the \nMinister is leading these visitors after him to Mos- \ncow in a most masterly way. The whole army feels \ngreat suspicion of the Imperial aide-de-camp Wol- \nzogen. He is said to be more Napoleon's man than \noui-s, and he is always advising the Minister. I am \nnot merely civil to him but obey him like a cor- \nporal, though I am his senior. This is painful, but, \nloving my benefactor and sovereign,! submit. Only \nI am sorry for the Emperor that he entrusts our \nfine army to such as he. Consider that on our re- \ntreat we have lost by fatigue and left in the hos- \npital more than fifteen thousand men, and had \nwe attacked this would not have happened. Tell \nme, for God's sake, what will Russia, our mother \nRussia, say to our being so frightened, and why \nare we abandoning our good and gallant Father- \nland to such rabble and implanting feelings of \n\n\n\nBOOK TEN \n\n\n\n403 \n\n\n\nhatred and shame in all our subjects? What are \nwe scared at and of whom are we afraid? I am not \nto blame that the Minister is vacillating, a coward, \ndense, dilatory, and has all bad qualities. The \nwhole army bewails it and calls down curses upon \nhim. . . . \n\nCHAPTER VI \n\nAMONG THE innumerable categories applicable \nto the phenomena of human life one may dis- \ncriminate between those in which substance \nprevails and those in which form prevails. To \nthe latter as distinguished from village, coun- \ntry, provincial, or even Moscow lifewe may \nallot Petersburg life, and especially the life of \nits salons. That life of the salons is unchanging. \nSince the year 1805 we had made peace and had \nagain quarreled with Bonaparte and had made \nconstitutions and unmade them again, but the \nsalons of Anna Pavlovnaand Helene remained \njust as they had been the one seven and the \nother five years before. At Anna Pavlovna's \nthey talked with perplexity of Bonaparte's suc- \ncesses just as before and saw in them and in \nthe subservience shown to him by the European \nsovereigns a malicious conspiracy, the sole ob- \nject of which was to cause unpleasantness and \nanxiety to the court circle of which Anna Pav- \nlovna was the representative. And in Helene's \nsalon, which Rumyantsev 1 himself honored \nwith his visits, regarding He'lene as a remark- \nably intelligent woman, they talked with the \nsame ecstacy in 1812 as in 1808 of the "great \nnation" and the "great man,"andregrettedour \nrupture with France, a rupture which, accord- \ning to them, ought to be promptly terminated \nby peace. \n\nOf late, since the Emperor's return from the \narmy, there had been some excitement in these \nconflicting salon circles and some demonstra- \ntions of hostility to one another, but each camp \nretained its own tendency. In Anna Pavlovna's \ncircle only those Frenchmen were admitted who \nwere deep-rooted legitimists, and patriotic \nviews were expressed to the effect that one \nought not to go to the French theater and that \nto maintain the French troupe was costing the \ngovernment as much as a whole army corps. \nThe progress of the war was eagerly followed, \nand only the reports most flattering to our ar- \nmy were circulated. In the French circle of He*- \nlene and Rumyantsev the reports of the cruel- \nty of the enemy and of the war were contradict- \ned and all Napoleon's attempts at conciliation \n\n1 Count N. P. Rumyantsev had been Minister of \nForeign Affairs in 1807, and in 1809 became Chan- \ncellor. TR. \n\n\n\nwere discussed. In that circle they discounte- \nnanced those who advised hurried preparations \nfor a removal to Kazan of the court and the \ngirls' educational establishments under the pa- \ntronage of the Dowager Empress. In Helena's \ncircle the war in general was regarded as a se- \nries of formal demonstrations which would very \nsoon end in peace, and the view prevailed ex- \npressed by BiHbin--whonow in Petersburg was \nquite at home in Helene's house, which every \nclever man was obliged to visit that not by \ngunpowder but by those who invented it would \nmatters be settled. In that circle the Moscow \nenthusiasm news of which had reached Peters- \nburg simultaneously with the Emperor's re- \nturnwas ridiculed sarcastically and very clev- \nerly, though with much caution. \n\nAnna Pavlovna's circle on the contrary was \nenraptured by this enthusiasm and spoke of it \nas Plutarch speaks of the deeds of the ancients. \nPrince Vasf li, who still occupied his former im- \nportant posts, formed a connecting link be- \ntween these two circles. He visited his "good \nfriend Anna Pavlovna"aswell as his daughter's \n"diplomatic salon," and often in his constant \ncomings and goings between the two camps be- \ncame confused and said at Helene's what he \nshould have said at Anna Pavlovna's and vice \nversa. \n\nSoon after the Emperor's return Prince Va- \nsili in a conversation about the war at Anna \nPavlovna's severely condemned Barclay de Tol- \nly, but was undecided as to who ought to be \nappointed commander in chief. One of the \nvisitors, usually spoken of as "a man of great \nmerit," having described how he had that day \nseen Kutuzov, the newly chosen chief of the \nPetersburg militia, presiding over the enroll- \nment of recruits at the Treasury, cautiously \nventured to suggest that Kutuzov would be the \nman to satisfy all requirements. \n\nAnna Pavlovna remarked with a melancholy \nsmile that Kutuzov had done nothing but cause \nthe Emperor annoyance. \n\n"I have talked and talked at the Assembly of \nthe Nobility," Prince Vasili interrupted, "but \nthey did not listen to me. I told them his elec- \ntion as chief of the militia would not please the \nEmperor. They did not listen to me. \n\n"It's all this mania for opposition," he went \non. "And who for? It is all because we want to \nape the foolish enthusiasm of those Musco- \nvites," Prince Vasili continued, forgetting for \na moment that though at Helene's one had to \nridicule the Moscow enthusiasm, at Anna Pav- \nlovna's one had to be ecstatic about it. But he \n\n\n\n404 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nretrieved his mistake at once. "Now, is it suit- \nable that Count Kutuzov, the oldest general \nin Russia, should preside at that tribunal? He \nwill get nothing for his pains! How could they \nmake a man commander in chief who cannot \nmount a horse, who drops asleep at a council, \nand has the very worst morals 1 A good reputa- \ntion he made for himself at Bucharest! I don't \nspeak of his capacity as a general, but at a time \nlike this how can they appoint a decrepit, blind \nold man, positively blind? A fine idea to have \na blind general! He can't see anything. To play \nblindman's bluff? He can't see at all!" \n\nNo one replied to his remarks. \n\nThis was quite correct on the twenty-fourth \nof July. But on the twenty-ninth of July Ku- \ntuzov received the title of Prince. This might \nindicate a wish to get rid of him, and therefore \nPrince Vasili's opinion continued to be correct \nthough he was not now in any hurry to express \nit. But on the eighth of August a committee, \nconsisting of Field Marshal Saltyk6v, Arak- \nchev, Vyazmitinov, Lopukhin, and Kochuby \nmet to consider the progress of the war. This \ncommit tee came to the conclusion that our fail- \nures were due to a want of unity in the com- \nmand and though the members of the commit- \ntee were aware of the Emperor's dislike of Ku- \ntuzov, after a short deliberation they agreed to \nadvise his appointment as commander in chief. \nThat same day Kutuzov was appointed com- \nmander in chief with full powers over the \narmies and over the whole region occupied by \nthem. \n\nOn the ninth of August Prince Vasfli at An- \nna Pdvlovna's again met the "man of great \nmerit." The latter was very attentive to Anna \nPavlovna because he wanted to be appointed \ndirector of one of the educational establish- \nments for young ladies. Prince Vasili entered \nthe room with the air of a happy conqueror \nwho has attained the object of his desires. \n\n"Well, have you heard the great news? \nPrince Kutuzov is field marshal! All dissensions \nare at an end! I am so glad, so delighted! At \nlast we have a man!" said he, glancing sternly \nand significantly round at everyone in the draw- \ning room. \n\nThe "man of great merit," despite his desire \nto obtain thepost of director, could not refrain \nfrom reminding Prince Vasili of his former \nopinion. Though this was impolite to Prince \nVasili in Anna Pdvlovna's drawing room, and \nalso to Anna Pavlovna herself who had re- \nceived the news with delight, he could not re- \nsist the temptation, \n\n\n\n"But, Prince, they say he is blindl" said he, \nreminding Prince Vasfli of his own words. \n\n"Eh? Nonsense! He sees well enough," said \nPrince Vasili rapidly, in a deep voice and with \na slight coughthe voice and cough with which \nhe was wont to dispose of all difficulties. \n\n"He sees well enough," he added. "And \nwhat I am so pleased about," he went on, "is \nthat our sovereign has given him full powers \nover all the armies and the whole region pow- \ners no commander in chief ever had before. He \nis a second autocrat," he concluded with a vic- \ntorious smile. \n\n"God grant it! God grant it!" said Anna \nPdvlovna. \n\nThe "man of great merit," who was still a \nnovice in court circles, wishing to flatter Anna \nPdvlovna by defending her former position on \nthis question, observed: \n\n"It is said that the Emperor was reluctant to \ngive Kutuzov those powers. They say he blushed \nlike a girl to whom Joconde * is read, when he \nsaid to Kutuzov: 'Your Emperor and the Father- \nland award you this honor.' " \n\n"Perhaps the heart took no part in that \nspeech," said Anna Pdvlovna. \n\n"Oh, no, no!" warmly rejoined Prince Vasili, \nwho would not now yield Kutuzov to anyone; \nin his opinion Kutuzovwas not only admirable \nhimself, but was adored by everybody. "No, \nthat's impossible," said he, "for our sovereign \nappreciated him so highly before." \n\n"God grant only that Prince Kutuzov as- \nsumes real power and does not allow anyone to \nput a spoke in his wheel," observed Anna Pdv- \nlovna. \n\nUnderstanding at once to whom she allud- \ned, Prince Vasili said in a whisper: \n\n"I know for a fact that Kutuzov made it an \nabsolute condition that the Tsar^vich should \nnot be with the army. Do you know what he \nsaid to the Emperor?" \n\nAnd Prince Vasili repeated the words sup- \nposed to have been spoken by Kutuzov to the \nEmperor. "I can neither punish him if he does \nwrong nor reward him if he does right." \n\n"Oh, a very wise man is Prince Kutuzov! I \nhave known him a long time!" \n\n"They even say," remarked the "man of \ngreat merit" who did not yet possess courtly \ntact, "that his excellency made it an express \ncondition that the sovereign himself should not \nbe with the army." \n\nAs soon as he said this both Prince Vasfli and \n\n1 Joconde La Fontaine's first contds in verse, \nwhich are considered improper,~TR. \n\n\n\nBOOK TEN \n\n\n\n405 \n\n\n\nAnna Pdvlovna turned away from him and \nglanced sadly at one another with a sigh at his \nnaivete*. \n\nCHAPTER VII \n\nWHILE THIS was taking place in Petersburg the \nFrench had already passed Smolensk and were \ndrawing nearer and nearer to Moscow. Napo- \nleon's historian Thiers, like other of his his- \ntorians, trying to justify his hero says that he \nwas drawn to the walls of Moscow against his \nwill. He is as right as other historians who look \nfor the explanation of historic events in the \nwill of one man; he is as right as the Russian \nhistorians who maintain that Napoleon was \ndrawn to Moscow by the skill of the Russian \ncommanders. Here besides the law of retrospec- \ntion, which regards all the past as a prepara- \ntion for events that subsequently occur, the \nlaw of reciprocity comes in, confusing the whole \nmatter. A good chessplayer having lost a game \nis sincerely convinced that his loss resulted \nfrom a mistake he made and looks for that mis- \ntake in the opening, but forgets that at each \nstage of the game there were similar mistakes \nand that none of his moves were perfect. He \nonly notices the mistake to which he pays at- \ntention, because his opponent took advantage \nof it. How much more complex than this is the \ngame of war, which occurs under certain limits \nof time, and where it is not one will that ma- \nnipulates lifelessobjects, but everything results \nfrom innumerable conflicts of various willsl \n\nAfter Smolensk Napoleon sought a battle be- \nyond Dorogobuzh at Vyazma, and then at \nTsdrevo-Zaymishche, but it happened that ow- \ning to a conjunction of innumerable circum- \nstances the Russians could not give battle till \nthey reached Borodin6, seventy miles from \nMoscow. From Vyazma Napoleon ordered a \ndirect advance on Moscow. \n\nMoscou, la capitate asiatique de ce grand \nempire, la ville sacreedes peuples d'Alexandre, \nMoscou avec ses innombrables eglises en forme \nde pagodes chinoises, 1 this Moscow gave Na- \npoleon's imagination no rest. On the march \nfrom Vydzma to Tsarevo-Zaymishche he rode \nhis light bay bobtailed ambler accompanied by \nhis Guards, his bodyguard, his pages, and aides- \nde-camp. Berthier, his chief of staff, dropped \nbehind to question a Russian prisoner cap- \ntured by the cavalry. Followed by Lelorgne \n\n1 "Moscow, the Asiatic capital of this great em- \npire, the sacred city of Alexander's people, Moscow \nwith its innumerable churches shaped like Chinese \npagodas." \n\n\n\nd'Ideville, an interpreter, he overtook Napo- \nleon at a gallop and reined in his horse with an \namused expression. \n\n"Well?" asked Napoleon. \n\n"One of Platov's Cossacks says that Pldtov's \ncorps is joining up with the main army and \nthat Kutiizov has been appointed commander \nin chief. He is a very shrewd and garrulous \nfellow." \n\nNapoleon smiled and told them to give the \nCossack a horse and bring the man to him. He \nwished to talk to him himself. Several adju- \ntants galloped off, and an hour later, Lavriish- \nka, the serf Denfsov had handed over to Ros- \nt6v, rode up to Napoleon in an orderly's jack- \net and on a French cavalry saddle, with a ro- \nguish, merry, and tipsy face. Napoleon told \nhim to ride by his side and began questioning \nhim. \n\n"You are a Cossack?" \n\n"Yes, a Cossack, your Honor." \n\n"The Cossack, not knowing in what com- \npany he was, for Napoleon's plain appearance \nhad nothing about it that would reveal to an \nOriental mind the presence of a monarch, \ntalked with extreme familiarity of the incidents \nof the war," says Thiers, narrating this episode. \nIn reality Lavriishka, having got drunk the \nday before and left his master dinnerless, had \nbeen whipped and sent to the village in quest \nof chickens, where he engaged in looting till \nthe French took him prisoner. Lavriishka was \none of those coarse, bare-faced lackeys who \nhave seen all sorts of things, consider it neces- \nsary to do everything in a mean and cunning \nway, are ready to render any sort of service \nto their master, and are keen at guessing \ntheir master's baser impulses, especially those \nprompted by vanity and pettiness. \n\nFinding himself in the company of Napole- \non, whose identity he had easily and surely rec- \nognized, Lavriishka was not in the least abashed \nbut merely did his utmost to gain his new mas- \nter's favor. \n\nHe knew very well that this was Napoleon, \nbut Napoleon's presence could no more intim- \nidate him than Rost6v's, or a sergeant major's \nwith the rods, would have done, for he had \nnothing that either the sergeant major or Na- \npoleon could deprive him of. \n\nSo he rattled on, telling all the gossip he had \nheard among the orderlies. Much of it was true. \nBut when Napoleon asked him whether the \nRussians thought they would beat Bonaparte \nor not, Lavriishka screwed up his eyes and con- \nsidered. \n\n\n\n406 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nIn this question he saw subtle cunning, as \nmen of his type see cunning in everything, so \nhe frowned and did not answer immediately. \n\n"It's like this," he said thoughtfully, "if \nthere's a battle soon, yours will win. That's \nright. But if three days pass, then after that, \nwell, then that same battle will not soon be \nover." \n\nLelorgne d'Ideville smilingly interpreted \nthis speech to Napoleon thus: "If a battle takes \nplace within the next three days the French \nwill win, but if later, God knows what will \nhappen." Napoleon did not smile, though he \nwas evidently in high good humor, and he or- \ndered these words to be repeated. \n\nLavrushka noticed this and to entertain him \nfurther, pretending not to know who Napo- \nleon was, added: \n\n"We know that you have Bonaparte and that \nhe has beaten everybody in the world, but we \nare a different matter . . ."without knowing \nwhy or how this bit of boastful patriotism \nslipped out at the end. \n\nThe interpreter translated these words with- \nout the last phrase, and Bonaparte smiled. \n"The young Cossack made his mighty inter- \nlocutor smile," says Thiers. After riding a few \npaces in silence, Napoleon turned to Berthier \nand said he wished to see how the news that he \nwas talking to the Emperor himself, to that \nvery Emperor who had written his immortally \nvictorious name on the Pyramids, would affect \nthis enfant du Don. 1 \n\nThe fact was accordingly conveyed toLavru- \nshka. \n\nLa vrtishka, understanding that this was done \nto perplex him and that Napoleon expected \nhim to be frightened, to gratify his new mas- \nters promptly pretended to be astonished and \nawe-struck, opened his eyes wide, and assumed \nthe expression he usually put on when taken \nto be whipped. "As soon as Napoleon's inter- \npreter had spoken," says Thiers, "the Cossack, \nseized by amazement, did not utter another \nword, but rode on, his eyes fixed on the con- \nqueror whose fame had reached him across the \nsteppes of the East. All his loquacity was sud- \ndenly arrested and replaced by a naive and si- \nlent feeling of admiration. Napoleon, after \nmaking the Cossack a present, had him set free \nlike a bird restored to its native fields." \n\nNapoleon rode on, dreaming of the Moscow \nthat so appealed to his imagination, and "the \nbird restored to its native fields" galloped to \nour outposts, inventing on the way all that had \n\n1 "Child of the Don." \n\n\n\nnot taken place but that he meant to relate to \nhis comrades. What had really taken place he \ndid not wish to relate because it seemed to him \nnot worth telling. He found the Cossacks, in- \nquired for the regiment operating with Pla- \ntov's detachment, and by evening found his \nmaster, Nicholas Rost6v, quartered at Yank6- \nvo. Rost6v was just mounting to go for a ride \nround the neighboring villages with Ilyfn; he \nlet Lavriishka have another horse and took him \nalong with him. \n\nCHAPTER VIII \n\nPRINCESS MARY was not in Moscow and out of \ndanger as Prince Andrew supposed. \n\nAfter the return of Alpatych from Smolensk \nthe old prince suddenly seemed to awake as \nfrom a dream. He ordered the militiamen to \nbe called up from the villages and armed, and \nwrote a letter to the commander in chief in- \nforming him that he had resolved to remain at \nBald Hills to the last extremity and to defend \nit, leaving to the commander in chief's discre- \ntion to take measures or not for the defense of \nBald Hills, where one of Russia's oldest gen- \nerals would be captured or killed, and he an- \nnounced to his household that he would re- \nmain at Bald Hills. \n\nBut while himself remaining, he gave in- \nstructions for the departure of the princess and \nDessalles with the little prince to Boguchdrovo \nand thence to Moscow. Princess Mary, alarmed \nby her father's feverish and sleepless activity \nafter his previous apathy, could not bring her- \nself to leave him alone and for the first time in \nher life ventured to disobey him. She refused \nto go away arid her father's fury broke over her \nin a terrible storm. He repeated every injustice \nhe had ever inflicted on her. Trying to convict \nher, he told her she had worn him out, had \ncaused his quarrel with his son, had harbored \nnasty suspicions of him, making it the object \nof her life to poison his existence, and he drove \nher from his study telling her that if she did \nnot go away it was all the same to him. He de- \nclared that he did not wish to remember her \nexistence and warned her not to dare to let \nhim see her. The fact that he did not, as she \nhad feared, order her to be carried away by \nforce but only told her not to let him see her \ncheered Princess Mary. She knew it was a proof \nthat in the depth of his soul he was glad she \nwas remaining at home and had not gone away. \n\nThe morning after little Nicholas had left, \nthe old prince donned his full uniform and \nprepared to visit the commander in chief. His \n\n\n\nBOOK TEN \n\n\n\n407 \n\n\n\ncaUche was already at the door. Princess Mary \nsaw him walk out of the house in his uniform \nwearing all his orders and go down the garden \nto review his armed peasants and domestic \nserfs. She sat by the window listening to his \nvoice which reached her from the garden. Sud- \ndenly several men came running up the avenue \nwith frightened faces. \n\nPrincess Mary ran out to the porch, down \nthe flower-bordered path, and into the avenue. \nA large crowd of militiamen and domestics \nwere moving toward her, and in their midst \nseveral men were supporting by the armpits \nand dragging along a little old man in a uni- \nform and decorations. She ran up to him and, \nin the play of the sunlight that fell in small \nround spots through the shade of the lime-tree \navenue, could not be sure what change there \nwas in his face. All she could see was that his \nformer stern and determined expression had \naltered to one of timidity and submission. On \nseeing his daughter he moved his helpless lips \nand made a hoarse sound. It was impossible to \nmake out what he wanted. He was lifted up, \ncarried to his study, and laid on the very couch \nhe had so feared of late. \n\nThe doctor, who was fetched that same night, \nbled him and said that the prince had had a \nseizure paralyzing his right side. \n\nIt was becoming more and more dangerous \nto remain at Bald Hills, and next day they \nmoved the prince to Bogucharovo, the doctor \naccompanying him. \n\nBy the time they reached Bogucharovo, Des- \nsalles and the little prince had already left for \nMoscow. \n\nFor three weeks the old prince lay stricken \nby paralysis in the new house Prince Andrew \nhad built at Bogucharovo, ever in the same \nstate, getting neither better nor worse. He was \nunconscious and lay like a distorted corpse. He \nmuttered unceasingly, his eyebrows and lips \ntwitching, and it was impossible to tell wheth- \ner he understood what was going on around \nhim or not. One thing was certain that he \nwas suffering and wished to say something. But \nwhat it was, no one could tell: it might be \nsome caprice of a sick and half-crazy man, or it \nmight relate to public affairs, or possibly to \nfamily concerns. \n\nThe doctor said this restlessness did not \nmean anything and was due to physical causes; \nbut Princess Mary thought he wished to tell \nher something, and the fact that her presence \nalways increased his restlessness confirmed her \nopinion. \n\n\n\nHe was evidently suffering both physically \nand mentally. There was no hope of recovery. \nIt was impossible for him to travel, it would \nnot do to let him die on the road. "Would it \nnot be better if the end did come, the very \nend?" Princess Mary sometimes thought. Night \nand day, hardly sleeping at all, she watched \nhim and, terrible to say, often watched him not \nwith hope of finding signs of improvement but \nwishing to find symptoms of the approach of \nthe end. \n\nStrange as it was to her to acknowledge this \nfeeling in herself, yet there it was. And what \nseemed still more terrible to her was that since \nher father's illness began (perhaps even sooner, \nwhen she stayed with him expectingsomething \nto happen), all the personal desires and hopes \nthat had been forgotten or sleeping within her \nhad awakened. Thoughts that had not entered \nher mind for yearsthoughts of a life free from \nthe fear of her father, and even the possibility \nof love and of family happiness floated con- \ntinually in her imagination like temptations of \nthe devil. Thrust them aside as she would, \nquestions continually recurred to her as to how \nshe would order her life now, after that. These \nwere temptations of the devil and Princess \nMary knew it. She knew that the sole weapon \nagainst him was prayer, and she tried to pray. \nShe assumed an attitude of prayer, looked at \nthe icons, repeated the words of a prayer, but \nshe could not pray. She felt that a different \nworld had now taken possession of her the \nlife of a world of strenuous and free activity, \nquite opposed to the spiritual world in which \ntill now she had been confined and in which \nher greatest comfort had been prayer. She could \nnot pray, could not weep, and worldly cares \ntook possession of her. \n\nIt was becoming dangerous to remain in \nBogucharovo. News of the approach of the \nFrench came from all sides, and in one village, \nten miles from Boguchdrovo, a homestead had \nbeen looted by French marauders. \n\nThe doctor insisted on the necessity of mov- \ning the prince; the provincial Marshal of the \nNobility sent an official to Princess Mary to \npersuade her to get away as quickly as possible, \nand the head of the rural police having come \nto Bogucharovo urged the same thing, saying \nthat the French were only some twenty-five \nmiles away, that French proclamations were \ncirculating in the villages, and that if the prin- \ncess did not take her father away before the \nfifteenth, he could not answer for the conse- \nquences. \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nThe princess decided to leave on the fif- \nteenth. The cares of preparation and giving \norders, for which everyone came to her, occu- \npied her all day. She spent the night of the \nfourteenth as usual, without undressing, in the \nroom next to the one where the prince lay. \nSeveral times, waking up, she heard his groans \nand muttering, the creak of his bed, and the \nsteps of Tikhon and the doctor when they \nturned him over. Several times she listened at \nthe door, and it seemed to her that his mutter- \nings were louder than usual and that they \nturned him over oftener. She could not sleep \nand several times went to the door and listened, \nwishing to enter but not deciding to do so. \nThough he did riot speak, Princess Mary saw \nand knew how unpleasant every sign of anxiety \non his account was to him. She had noticed \nwith what dissatisfaction he turned from the \nlook she sometimes involuntarily fixed on him. \nShe knew that her going in during the night \nat an unusual hour would irritate him. \n\nBut never had she felt so grieved for him or \nso much afraid of losing him. She recalled all \nher life with him and in every word and act of \nhis found an expression of his love of her. Occa- \nsionally amid these memories temptations of \nthe devil would surge into her imagination: \nthoughts of how things would be after his \ndeath, and how her new, liberated life would \nbe ordered. But she drove these thoughts away \nwith disgust. Toward morning he became quiet \nand she fell asleep. \n\nShe woke late. That sincerity which often \ncomes with waking showed her clearly what \nchiefly concerned her about her father's illness. \nOn waking she listened to what was going on \nbehind the door and, hearing him groan, said \nto herself with a sigh that things were still the \nsame. \n\n"But what could have happened? What did \nI want? I want his death!" she cried with a \nfeeling of loathing for herself. \n\nShe washed, dressed, said her prayers, and \nwent out to the porch. In front of it stood car- \nnages without horses and things were being \npacked into the vehicles. \n\nIt was a warm, gray morning. Princess Mary \nstopped at the porch, still horrified by her \nspiritual baseness and trying to arrange her \nthoughts before going to her father. The doc- \ntor came downstairs and went out to her. \n\n"He is a little better today," said he. "I was \nlooking for you. One can make out something \nof what he is saying. His head is clearer. Come \nin, he is asking for you. . . ." \n\n\n\nPrincess Mary's heart beat so violently at \nthis news that she grew pale and leaned against \nthe wall to keep from falling. To see him, talk \nto him, feel his eyes on her now that her whole \nsoul was overflowing with those dreadful, \nwicked temptations, was a torment of joy and \nterror. \n\n"Come," said the doctor. \n\nPrincess Mary entered her father's room and \nwent up to his bed. He was lying on his back \npropped up high, and his small bony hands \nwith their knotted purple veins were lying on \nthe quilt; his left eye gazed straight before him, \nhis right eye was awry, and his brows and lips \nmotionless. He seemed altogether so thin, \nsmall, and pathetic. His face seemed to have \nshriveled or melted; his features had grown \nsmaller. Princess Mary went up and kissed his \nhand. His left hand pressed hers so that she \nunderstood that he had long been waiting for \nher to come. He twitched her hand, and his \nbrows and lips quivered angrily. \n\nShe looked at him in dismay trying to guess \nwhat he wanted of her. When she changed her \nposition so that his left eye could see her face \nhe calmed down, not taking his eyes off her for \nsome seconds. Then his lips and tongue moved, \nsounds came, and he begati to speak, gazing \ntimidly and imploringly at her, evidently \nafraid that she might not understand. \n\nStraining all her faculties Princess Mary \nlooked at him. The comic efforts with which \nhe moved his tongue made her drop her eyes \nand with difficulty repress the sobs that rose \nto her throat. He said something, repeating the \nsame words several times. She could not under- \nstand them, but tried to guess what he was say- \ning and inquiringly repeated the words he ut- \ntered. \n\n"Mmm ... ar ... ate ... ate . . ." he repeated \nseveral times. \n\nIt was quite impossible to understand these \nsounds. The doctor thought he had guessed \nthem, and inquiringly repeated: "Mary, are \nyou afraid?" The prince shook his head, and \nagain repeated the same sounds. \n\n"My mind, my mind aches?" questioned \nPrincess Mary. \n\nHe made a mumbling sound in confirma- \ntion of this, took her hand, and began pressing \nit to different parts of his breast as if trying to \nfind the right place for it. \n\n"Always thoughts . . . about you . . . thoughts \n. . ." he then uttered much more clearly than \nhe had done before, now that he was sure of \nbeing understood. \n\n\n\nBOOK TfcN \n\n\n\nPrincess Mary pressed her head against his \nhand, trying to hide her sobs and tears. \n\nHe moved his hand over her hair. \n\n"I have been calling you all night . . ." he \nbrought out. \n\n"If only I had known . . ." she said through \nher tears. "I was afraid to come in." \n\nHe pressed her hand. \n\n"Weren't you asleep?" \n\n"No, I did not sleep," said Princess Mary, \nshaking her head. \n\nUnconsciously imitating her father, she now \ntried to express herself as he did, as much as \npossible by signs, and her tongue too seemed \nto move with difficulty. \n\n"Dear one . . . Dearest . . ." Princess Mary \ncould not quite make out what he said, but \nfrom his look it was clear that he had uttered a \ntender caressing word such as he had never \nused to her before. "Why didn't you come in?" \n\n"And I, I was wishing for his death!" thought \nPrincess Mary. \n\nHe was silent awhile. \n\n"Thank you . . . daughter dearl . . . for all, \nfor all ... forgive! . . . thank you! . . . forgive! \n. . . thank you! ..." and tears began to flow from \nhis eyes. "Call Andrew!" he said suddenly, and \na childish, timid expression of doubt showed \nitself on his face as he spoke. \n\nHe himself seemed aware that his demand \nwas meaningless. So at least it seemed to Prin- \ncess Mary. \n\n"I have a letter from him," she replied. \n\nHe glanced at her with timid surprise. \n\n"Where is he?" \n\n"He's with the army, Father, at Smolensk." \n\nHe closed his eyes and remained silent a \nlong time. Then as if in answer to his doubts \nand to confirm the fact that now he under- \nstood and remembered everything, he nodded \nhis head and reopened his eyes. \n\n"Yes," he said, softly and distinctly. "Russia \nhas perished. They've destroyed her." \n\nAnd he began to sob, and again tears flowed \nfrom his eyes. Princess Mary could no longer \nrestrain herself and wept while she gazed at his \nface. \n\nAgain he closed his eyes. His sobs ceased, he \npointed to his eyes, and Tfkhon, understand- \ning him, wiped away the tears. \n\nThen he again opened his eyes and said \nsomething none of them could understand for \na long time, till at last Tikhon understood and \nrepeated it. Princess Mary had sought the mean- \ning of his words in the mood in which he had \njust been speaking. She thought he was speak- \n\n\n\ning of Russia, or Prince Andrew, of herself, of \nhis grandson, or of his own death, and so she \ncould not guess his words. \n\n"Put on your white dress. I like it," was what \nhe said. \n\nHaving understood this Princess Mary \nsobbed still louder, and the doctor taking her \narm led her out to the veranda, soothing her \nand trying to persuade her to prepare for her \njourney. When she had left the room the prince \nagain began speaking about his son, about the \nwar, and about the Emperor, angrily twitching \nhis brows and raising his hoarse voice, and \nthen he had a second and final stroke. \n\nPrincess Mary stayed on the veranda. The \nday had cleared, it was hot and sunny. She \ncould understand nothing, think of nothing \nand feel nothing, except passionate love for \nher father, love such as she thought she had \nnever felt till that moment. She ran out sob- \nbing into the garden and as far as the pond, \nalong the avenues of young lime trees Prince \nAndrew had planted. \n\n"Yes ...I...I...I wished for his death! \nYes, I wanted it to end quicker. ... I wished to \nbe at peace. . . . And what will become of me? \nWhat use will peace be when he is no longer \nhere?" Princess Mary murmured, pacing the \ngarden with hurried steps and pressing her \nhands to her bosom which heaved with con- \nvulsive sobs. \n\nWhen she had completed the tour of the \ngarden, which brought her again to the house, \nshe saw Mademoiselle Bourienne who had re- \nmained at Bogucharovo and did not wish to \nleave itcoming toward her with a stranger. \nThis was the Marshal of the Nobility of the \ndistrict, who had come personally to point out \nto the princess the necessity for her prompt de- \nparture. Princess Mary listened without under- \nstanding him; she led him to the house, offered \nhim lunch, and sat down with him. Then, \nexcusing herself, she went to the door of \nthe old prince's room. The doctor came out \nwith an agitated face and said she could not \nenter. \n\n"Go away, Princess! Go away ... go away!" \n\nShe returned to the garden and sat down on \nthe grass at the foot of the slope by the pond, \nwhere no one could see her. She did not know \nhow long she had been there when she was \naroused by the sound of a woman's footsteps \nrunning along the path. She rose and saw Dun- \nyasha her maid, who was evidently looking for \nher, and who stopped suddenly as if in alarm \non seeing her mistress. \n\n\n\n4io \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\n"Please come, Princess . . . The Prince . . ." \nsaid Dunydsha in a breaking voice. \n\n"Immediately, I'm coming, I'm coming 1" re- \nplied the princess hurriedly, not giving Dun- \nydsha time to finish what she was saying, and \ntrying to avoid seeing the girl she ran toward \nthe house. \n\n"Princess, it's God's willl You must be pre- \npared for everything," said the Marshal, meet- \ning her at the house door. \n\n"Let me alone; it's not true!" she cried an- \ngrily to him. \n\nThe doctor tried to stop her. She pushed \nhim aside and ran to her father's door. "Why \nare these people with frightened faces stop- \nping me? I don't want any of theml And what \nare they doing here?" she thought. She opened \nthe door and the bright daylight in that previ- \nously darkened room startled her. In the room \nwere her nurse and other women. They all \ndrew back from the bed, making way for her. \nHe was still lying on the bed as before, but the \nstern expression of his quiet face made Prin- \ncess Mary stop short on the threshold. \n\n"No, he's not dead it's impossiblel" she told \nherself and approached him, and repressing the \nterror that seized her, she pressed her lips to his \ncheek. But she stepped back immediately. All \nthe force of the tenderness she had been feel- \ning for him vanished instantly and was re- \nplaced by a feeling of horror at what lay there \nbefore her. "No, he is no morel He is not, but \nhere where he was is something unfamiliarand \nhostile, some dreadful, terrifying, and repellent \nmystery I" And hiding her face in her hands, \nPrincess Mary sank into the arms of the doctor, \nwho held her up. \n\n\n\nIn the presence \nthe women washed \n\n\n\nnd the doctor, \nat had been the \n\n\n\np \n\ntied his head up with a nanclkercITTeTTffaTThe \nmouth should not stiffen while open, and with \nanother handkerchief tied together the legs \nthat were already spreading apart. Then they \ndressed him in uniform with his decorations \nand placed his shriveled little body on a table. \nHeaven only knows who arranged all this and \nwhen, but it all got done as if of its own ac- \ncord. Toward night candles were burning \nround his coffin, a pall was spread over it, the \nfloor was strewn with sprays of juniper, a \nprinted band was tucked in under his shriveled \nhead, and in a corner of the room sat a chanter \nreading the psalms. \n\nJust as horses shy and snort and gather about \na dead horse, so the inmates of the house and \n\n\n\nstrangers crowded into the drawing room round \nthe coffin the Marshal, the village Elder, peas- \nant womenand all with fixed and frightened \neyes, crossing themselves, bowed and kissed the \nold prince's cold and stiffened hand. \n\nCHAPTER IX \n\nUNTIL PRINCE ANDREW settled in Boguchdrovo \nits owners had always been absentees, and its \npeasants were of quite a different character \nfrom those of Bald Hills. They differed from \nthem in speech, dress, and disposition. They \nwere called steppe peasants. The old prince \nused to approve of them for their endurance at \nwork when they came to Bald Hills to help with \nthe harvest or to dig ponds and ditches, but he \ndisliked them for their boorishness. \n\nPrince Andrew's last stay at Boguchdrovo, \nwhen he introduced hospitals and schools and \nreduced the quitrent the peasants had to pay, \nhad not softened their disposition but had on \nthe contrary strengthened in them the traits of \ncharacter the old prince called boorishness. \nVarious obscure rumors were always current \namong them: at one time a rumor that they \nwould all be enrolled as Cossacks; at another \nof a new religion to which they were all to be \nconverted; then of some proclamation of the \nTsar's and of an oath to the Tsar Paul in 1 797 \n(in connection with which it was rumored that \nfreedom had been granted them but the land- \nowners had stopped it), then of Peter Fedoro- \nvich's 1 return to the throne in seven years' \ntime, when everything would be made free and \nso "simple" that there would be no restrictions. \nRumors of the war with Bonaparte and his in- \nvasion were connected in their minds with the \nsame sort of vague notions of Antichrist, the \nend of the world, and "pure freedom." \n\nIn the vicinity of Bogucharovo were large \nvillages belonging to the crown or to owners \nwhose serfs paid quitrent and could work \nwhere they pleased. There were very few resi- \ndent landlords in the neighborhood and also \nvery few domestic or literate serfs, and in the \nlives of the peasantry of those parts the myste- \nrious undercurrents in the life of the Russian \npeople, the causes and meaning of which are \nso baffling to contemporaries, were more clear- \nly and strongly noticeable than among others. \nOne instance, which had occurred some twenty \nyears before, was a movement among the peas- \nants to emigrate to some unknown "warm riv- \n\n1 Peter III, who was assassinated, or died, on the \naccession of his wife, Catherine II, to the throne in \n\n\n\nBOOK \n\ners." Hundreds of peasants, among them the \nBoguchdrovo folk, suddenly began selling their \ncattle and moving in whole families toward \nthe southeast. As birds migrate to somewhere \nbeyond the sea, so these men with their wives \nand children streamed to the southeast, to parts \nwhere none of them had ever been. They set \noff in caravans, bought their freedom one by \none or ran away, and drove or walked toward \nthe "warm rivers." Many of them were pun- \nished, some sent to Siberia, many died of cold \nand hunger on the road, many returned of \ntheir own accord, and the movement died down \nof itself just as it had sprung up, without ap- \nparent reason. But such undercurrents still \nexisted among the people and gathered new \nforces ready to manifest themselves just as \nstrangely, unexpectedly, and at the same time \nsimply, naturally, and forcibly. Now in 1812, \nto anyone living in close touch with these peo- \nple it was apparent that these undercurrents \nwere acting strongly and nearing an eruption. \n\nAlpdtych, who had reached Boguchdrovo \nshortly before the old prince's death, noticed \nan agitation among the peasants, and that con- \ntrary to what was happening in the Bald Hills \ndistrict, where over a radius of forty miles all \nthe peasants were moving away and leaving \ntheir villages to be devastated by the Cossacks, \nthe peasants in the steppe region round Bogu- \nchdrovo were, it was rumored, in touch with \nthe French, received leaflets from them that \npassed from hand to hand, and did not migrate. \nHe learned from domestic serfs loyal to him \nthat the peasant Karp, who possessed great \ninfluence in the village commune and had re- \ncently been away driving a government trans- \nport, had returned with news that the Cossacks \nwere destroying deserted villages, but that the \nFrench did not harm them. Alpdtych also knew \nthat on the previous day another peasant had \neven brought from the village of Visloukhovo, \nwhich was occupied by the French, a procla- \nmation by a French general that no harm \nwould be done to the inhabitants, and if they \nremained they would be paid for anything tak- \nen from them. As proof of this the peasant \nhad brought from Visloukhovo a hundred ru- \nbles in notes (he did not know that they were \nfalse) paid to him in advance for hay. \n\nMore important still, Alpdtych learned that \non the morning of the very day he gave the vil- \nlage Elder orders to collect carts to move the \nprincess* luggage from Boguchdrovo, there had \nbeen a village meeting at which it had been de- \ncided not to move but to wait. Yet there was \n\n\n\nTEN 411 \n\nno time to waste. On the fifteenth, the day of \nthe old prince's death, the Marshal had insisted \non Princess Mary's leaving at once, as it was \nbecoming dangerous. He had told her that aft- \ner the sixteenth he could not be responsible \nfor what might happen. On the evening of the \nday the old prince died the Marshal went away, \npromising to return next day for the funeral. \nBut this he was unable to do, for he received \ntidings that the French had unexpectedly ad- \nvanced, and had barely time to remove his own \nfamily and valuables from his estate. \n\nFor some thirty years Boguchdrovo had been \nmanaged by the village Elder, Dron, whom the \nold prince called by the diminutive "Dr6nush- \nka." \n\nDron was one of those physically and men tal- \nly vigorous peasants who grow big beards as \nsoon as they are of age and go on unchanged \ntill they are sixty or seventy, without a gray \nhair or the loss of a tooth, as straight and strong \nat sixty as at thirty. \n\nSoon after the migration to the "warm riv- \ners," in which he had taken part like the rest, \nDron was made village Elder and overseer of \nBoguchdrovo, and had since filled that post ir- \nreproachably for twenty-three years. The peas- \nants feared him more than they did their mas- \nter. The masters, both the old prince and the \nyoung, and the steward respected him and \njestingly called him "the Minister." During \nthe whole time of his service Dron had never \nbeen drunk or ill, never after sleepless nights \nor the hardest tasks had he shown the least fa- \ntigue, and though he could not read he had \nnever forgotten a single money account or the \nnumber of quarters of flour in any of the end- \nless cartloads he sold for the prince, nor a sin- \ngle shock of the whole corn crop on any single \nacre of the Boguchdrovo fields. \n\nAlpdtych, arriving from the devastated Bald \nHills estate, sent for his Dron on the day of \nthe prince's funeral and told him to have \ntwelve horses got ready for the princess* car- \nriages and eighteen carts for the things to be \nremoved from Boguchdrovo. Though the peas- \nants paid quitrent, Alpdtych thought no dif- \nficulty would be made about complying with \nthis order, for there were two hundred and \nthirty households at work in Boguchdrovo and \nthe peasants were well to do. But on hearing \nthe order Dron lowered his eyes and remained \nsilent. Alpdtych named certain peasants he \nknew, from whom he told him to take the carts. \n\nDron replied that the horses of these peas- \nants were away carting. Alpdtych named oth- \n\n\n\n412 WAR AND PEACE \n\ncrs, but they too, according to Dron, had no \nhorses available: some horses were carting for \nthe government, others were too weak, and \nothers had died for want of fodder. It seemed \nthat no horses could be had even for the car- \nriages, much less for the carting. \n\nAlpdtych looked intently at Dron and \nfrowned. Just as Dron was a model village Eld- \ner, so Alpdtych had not managed the prince's \nestates for twenty years in vain. He was a model \nsteward, possessing in the highest degree the \nfaculty of divining the needs and instincts of \nthose he dealt with. Having glanced at Dron \nhe at once understood that his answers did not \nexpress his personal views but the general \nmood of the Boguchdrovo commune, by which \nthe Elder had already been carried away. But \nhe also knew that Dron, who had acquired \nproperty and was hated by the commune, must \nbe hesitating between the two camps: the mas- \nters' and the serfs'. He noticed this hesitation \nin Dron's look and therefore frowned and \nmoved closer up to him. \n\n"Now just listen, Dr6nushka," said he. \n"Don't talk nonsense to me. His excellency \nPrince Andrew himself gave me orders to move \nall the people away and not leave them with \nthe enemy, and there is an order from the Tsar \nabout it too. Anyone who stays is a traitor to \nthe Tsar. Do you hear?" \n\n"I hear," Dron answered without lifting his \neyes. \n\nAlpdtych was not satisfied with this reply. \n\n"Eh, Dron, it will turn out badly 1" he said, \nshaking his head. \n\n"The power is in your hands," Dron rejoined \nsadly. \n\n"Eh, Dron, drop it!" Alpdtych repeated, \nwithdrawing his hand from his bosom and sol- \nemnly pointing to the floor at Dron's feet. "I \ncan see through you and three yards into the \nground under you," he continued, gazing at \nthe floor in front of Dron. \n\nDron was disconcerted, glanced furtively at \nAlpdtych and again lowered his eyes. \n\n"You drop this nonsense and tell the people \nto get ready to leave their homes and go to \nMoscow and to get carts ready for tomorrow \nmorning for the princess* things. And don't go \nto any meeting yourself, do you hear?" \n\nDron suddenly fell on his knees. \n\n"Ydkov Alpdtych, discharge me! Take the \nkeys from me and discharge me, for Christ's \nsake!" \n\n"Stop that!" cried Alpdtych sternly. "I see \nthrough you and three yards under you," he \n\n\n\nrepeated, knowing that his skill in beekeeping, \nhis knowledge of the right time to sow the oats, \nand the fact that he had been able to retain \nthe old prince's favor for twenty years had long \nsince gained him the reputation of being a \nwizard, and that the power of seeing three \nyards under a man is considered an attribute \nof wizards. \n\nDron got up and was about to say something, \nbut Alpdtych interrupted him. \n\n"What is it you have got into your heads, \neh? . . . What are you thinking of, eh?" \n\n"What am I to do with the people?" said \nDron. "They're quite beside themselves; I have \nalready told them . . ." \n\n" 'Told them,' I dare say!" said Alpdtych. \n"Are they drinking?" he asked abruptly. \n\n"Quite beside themselves, Ydkov Alpdtych; \nthey've fetched another barrel." \n\n"Well, then, listen! I'll go to the police of- \nficer, and you tell them so, and that they must \nstop this and the carts must be got ready." \n\n"I understand." \n\nAlpdtych did not insist further. He had man- \naged people for a long time and knew that the \nchief way to make them obey is to show no sus- \npicion that they can possibly disobey. Having \nwrung a submissive "I understand" from Dron, \nAlpatych contented himself with that, though \nhe not only doubted but felt almost certain \nthat without the help of troops the carts would \nnot be forthcoming. \n\nAnd so it was, for when evening came no \ncarts had been provided. In the village, out- \nside the drink shop, another meeting was be- \ning held, which decided that the horses should \nbe driven out into the woods and the carts \nshould not be provided. Without saying any- \nthing of this to the princess, Alpdtych had his \nown belongings taken out of the carts which \nhad arrived from Bald Hills and had those \nhorses got ready for the princess' carriages. \nMeanwhile he went himself to the police au- \nthorities. \n\nCHAPTER X \n\nAFTER HER FATHER'S FUNERAL Princess Mary \nshut herself up in her room and did not admit \nanyone. A maid came to the door to say that \nAlpdtych was asking for orders about their de- \nparture. (This was before his talk with Dron.) \nPrincess Mary raised herself on the sofa on \nwhich she had been lying and replied through \nthe closed door that she did not mean to go \naway and begged to be left in peace. \nThe windows of the room in which she was \n\n\n\nBOOK TEN \n\n\n\n4*3 \n\n\n\nlying looked westward. She lay on the sofa with \nher face to the wall, fingering the buttons of \nthe leather cushion and seeing nothing but \nthat cushion, and her confused thoughts were \ncentered on one subject the irrevocability of \ndeath and her own spiritual baseness, which \nshe had not suspected, but which had shown \nitself during her father's illness. She wished to \npray but did not dare to, dared not in her \npresent state of mind address herself to God. \nShe lay for a long time in that position. \n\nThe sun had reached the other side of the \nhouse, and its slanting rays shone into theopen \nwindow, lighting up the room and part of the \nmorocco cushion at which Princess Mary was \nlooking. The flow of her thoughts suddenly \nstopped. Unconsciously she sat up, smoothed \nher hair, got up, and went to the window, in- \nvoluntarily inhaling the freshness of the clear \nbut windy evening. \n\n"Yes, you can well enjoy the evening now! \nHe is gone and no one will hinder you," she \nsaid to herself, and sinking into a chair she let \nher head fall on the window sill. \n\nSomeone spoke her name in a soft and ten- \nder voice from the garden and kissed her head. \nShe looked up. It was Mademoiselle Bouri- \nenne in a black dress and weepers. She softly \napproached Princess Mary, sighed, kissed her, \nand immediately began to cry. The princess \nlooked up at her. All their former disharmony \nand her own jealousy recurred to her mind. \nBut she remembered too how he had changed \nof late toward Mademoiselle Bourienne and \ncould not bear to see her, thereby showing how \nunjust were the reproaches Princess Mary had \nmentally addressed to her. "Besides, is it for \nme, for me who desired his death, to condemn \nanyone?" she thought. \n\nPrincess Mary vividly pictured to herself the \nposition of Mademoiselle Bourienne, whom \nshe had of late kept at a distance, but who yet \nwas dependent on her and living in her house. \nShe felt sorry for her and held out her hand \nwith a glance of gentle inquiry. Mademoiselle \nBourienne at once began crying again and \nkissed that hand, speaking of the princess' sor- \nrow and making herself a partner in it. She \nsaid her only consolation was the fact that the \nprincess allowed her to share her sorrow, that \nall the old misunderstandings should sink into \nnothing but this great grief; that she felt her- \nself blameless in regard to everyone, and that \nhe, from above, saw her affection and grati- \ntude. The princess heard her, not heeding her \nwords but occasionally looking up at her and \n\n\n\nlistening to the sound of her voice. \n\n"Your position is doubly terrible, dear prin- \ncess," said Mademoiselle Bourienne after a \npause. "I understand that you could not, and \ncannot, think of yourself, but with my love for \nyou I must do so. ... Has Alpdtych been to \nyou? Has he spoken to you of going away?" she \nasked. \n\nPrincess Mary did not answer. She did not \nunderstand who was to go or where to. "Is it \npossible to plan or think of anything now? Is \nit not all the same?" she thought, and did not \nreply. \n\n"You know, chere Marie/' said Mademoi- \nselle Bourienne, "that we are in danger are \nsurrounded by the French. It would be danger- \nous to move now. If we go we are almost sure \nto be taken prisoners, and God knows . . ." \n\nPrincess Mary looked at her companion with- \nout understanding what she was talking about. \n\n"Oh, if anyone knew how little anything \nmatters to me now," she said. "Of course I \nwould on no account wish to go away from \nhim. . . . Alpdtych did say something about go- \ning. . . . Speak to him; I can do nothing, noth- \ning, and don't want to. . . ." \n\n"I've spoken to him. He hopes we should be \nin time to get away tomorrow, but I think it \nwould now be better to stay here," said Made- \nmoiselle Bourienne. "Because, you will agree, \nchere Marie, to fall into the hands of the sol- \ndiers or of riotous peasants would be terrible." \n\nMademoiselle Bourienne took from her \nreticule a proclamation (not printed on ordi- \nnary Russian paper) of General Rameau's, tell- \ning people not to leave their homes and that \nthe French authorities would afford them prop- \ner protection. She handed this to the princess. \n\n"I think it would be best to appeal to that \ngeneral," she continued, "and I am sure that \nall due respect would be shown you." \n\nPrincess Mary read the paper, and her face \nbegan to quiver with stifled sobs. \n\n"From whom did you get this?" she asked. \n\n"They probably recognized that I am French, \nby my name," replied Mademoiselle Bouri- \nenne blushing. \n\nPrincess Mary, with the paper in her hand, \nrose from the window and with a pale face \nwent out of the room and into what had been \nPrince Andrew's study. \n\n"Dunydsha,send Alpatych,or Dr6nushka, or \nsomebody to me!" she said, "and tell Mademoi- \nselle Bourienne not to come to me," she added, \nhearing Mademoiselle Bourienne's voice. "We \nmust go at once, at once!" she said, appalled at \n\n\n\n414 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nthe thought of being left in the hands of the \nFrench. \n\n"If Prince Andrew heard that I was in the \npower of the French! That I, the daughter of \nPrince Nicholas Bolk6nski, asked General Ra- \nmeau for protection and accepted his favorl" \nThis idea horrified her, made her shudder, \nblush, and feel sudi a rush of anger and pride \nas she had never experienced before. All that \nwas distressing, and especially all that was hu- \nmiliating, in her position rose vividly to her \nmind. "They, the French, would settle in this \nhouse: M. le General Rameau would occupy \nPrince Andrew's study and amuse himself by \nlooking through and reading his letters and \npapers. Mademoiselle Bourienne would do \nthe honors of Boguchdrovo for him. I should \nbe given a small room as a favor, the soldiers \nwould violate my father's newly dug grave to \nsteal his crosses and stars, they would tell me \nof their victories over the Russians, and would \npretend to sympathize with my sorrow . . ." \nthought Princess Mary, not thinking her own \nthoughts but feeling bound to think like her \nfather and her brother. For herself she did not \ncare where she remained or what happened to \nher, but she felt herself the representative of \nher dead father and of Prince Andrew. Invol- \nuntarily she thought their thoughts and felt \ntheir feelings. What they would have said and \nwhat they would have done she felt bound to \nsay and do. She went into Prince Andrew's \nstudy, trying to enter completely into his ideas, \nand considered her position. \n\nThe demands of life, which had seemed to \nher annihilated by her father's death, all at \nonce rose before her with a new, previously un- \nknown force and took possession of her. \n\nAgitated and flushed she paced the room, \nsending now for Michael Ivanovich and now \nfor Tikhon or Dron. Dunydsha, the nurse, and \nthe other maids could not say in how far Made- \nmoiselle Bourienne's statement was correct. \nAlpdtych was riot at home, he had gone to the \npolice. Neither could the architect Michael \nIvanovich, who on being sent for came in with \nsleepy eyes, tell Princess Mary anything. With \njust the same smile of agreement with which \nfor fifteen years he had been accustomed to \nanswer the old prince without expressing views \nof his own, he now replied to Princess Mary, so \nthat nothing definite could be got from his \nanswers. The old valet Tikhon, with sunken, \nemaciated face that bore the stamp of incon- \nsolable grief, replied: "Yes, Princess" to all \nPrincess Mary's questions and hardly refrained \n\n\n\nfrom sobbing as he looked at her. \n\nAt length Dron, the village Elder, entered \nthe room and with a deep bow to Princess \nMary came to a halt by the doorpost. \n\nPrincess Mary walked up and down the \nroom and stopped in front of him. \n\n"Dr6nushka," she said, regarding as a sure \nfriend this Dr6nushka who always used to \nbring a special kind of gingerbread from his \nvisit to the fair at Vyazma every year and smil- \ningly offer it to her, "Dr6nushka, now since \nour misfortune . . ." she began, but could not \ngo on. \n\n"We are all in God's hands," said he, with a \nsigh. \n\nThey were silent for a while. \n\n"Dronushka, Alpdtych has gone off some- \nwhere and I have no one to turn to. Is it true, \nas they tell me, that I can't even go away?" \n\n"Why shouldn't you go away, your excel- \nlency? You can go," said Dron. \n\n"I was told it would be dangerous because \nof the enemy. Dear friend, I can do nothing. I \nunderstand nothing. I have nobody I I want to \ngo away tonight or early tomorrow morning." \n\nDron paused. He looked askance at Princess \nMary and said: "There are no horses; I told \nYdkov Alpdtych so." \n\n"Why are there none?" asked the princess. \n\n"It's all God's scourge," said Dron. "What \nhorses we had have been taken for the army or \nhave died this is such a year! It's not a case of \nfeeding horses we may die of hunger ourselves 1 \nAs it is, some go three days without eating. \nWe've nothing, we've been ruined." \n\nPrincess Mary listened attentively to what \nhe told her. \n\n"The peasants are ruined? They have no \nbread?" she asked. \n\n"They're dying of hunger," said Dron. "It's \nnot a case of carting." \n\n"But why didn't you tell me, Dr6nushka? \nIsn't it possible to help them? I'll do all I \ncan. . . ." \n\nTo Princess Mary it was strange that now, at \na moment when such sorrow was filling her \nsoul, there could be rich people and poor, and \nthe rich could refrain from helping the poor. \nShe had heard vaguely that there was such a \nthing as "landlord's corn" which was some- \ntimes given to the peasants. She also knew that \nneither her father nor her brother would re- \nfuse to help the peasants in need, she only \nfeared to make some mistake in speaking \nabout the distribution of the grain she wished \nto give. She was glad such cares presented them- \n\n\n\nBOOK TEN \n\n\n\n415 \n\n\n\nselves, enabling her without scruple to forget \nher own grief. She began asking Dron about \nthe peasants' needs and what there was in \nBoguchdrovo that belonged to the landlord. \n\n"But we have grain belonging to my broth- \ner?" she said. \n\n"The landlord's grain is all safe," replied \nDron proudly. "Our prince did not order it to \nbe sold." \n\n"Give it to the peasants, let them have all \nthey need; I give you leave in my brother's \nname," said she. \n\nDron made no answer but sighed deeply. \n\n"Give them that corn if there is enough of \nit. Distribute it all. I give this order in my \nbrother's name; and tell them that what is ours \nis theirs. We do not grudge them anything. \nTell them so." \n\nDron looked intently at the princess while \nshe was speaking. \n\n"Discharge me, little mother, for God's sakel \nOrder the keys to be taken from me," said he. \n"I have served twenty-three years and have \ndone no wrong. Discharge me, for God's sake!" \n\nPrincess Mary did not understand what he \nwanted of her or why he was asking to be dis- \ncharged. She replied that she had never doubt- \ned his devotion and that she was ready to do \nanything for him and for the peasants. \n\nCHAPTER XI \n\nAN HOUR LATER Dunydsha came to tell the prin- \ncess that Dron had come, and all the peasants \nhad assembled at the barn by the princess' or- \nder and wished to have word with their mis- \ntress. \n\n"But I never told them to come," said Prin- \ncess Mary. "I only told Dron to let them have \nthe grain." \n\n"Only, for God's sake, Princess dear, have \nthem sent away and don't go out to them. It's \nall a trick," said Dunydsha, "and when Yakov \nAlpdtych returns let us get away . . . and please \ndon't . . ." \n\n"What is a trick?" asked Princess Mary in \nsurprise. \n\n"I know it is, only listen to me for God's \nsake! Ask nurse too. They say they don't agree \nto leave Bogucharovo as you ordered." \n\n"You're making some mistake. I never or- \ndered them to go away," said Princess Mary. \n"Call Drdnushka." \n\nDron came and confirmed Dunydsha's words; \nthe peasants had come by the princess' order. \n\n"But I never sent for them," declared the \nprincess. "You must have given my message \n\n\n\nwrong. I only said that you were to give them \nthe grain." \n\nDron only sighed in reply. \n\n"If you order it they will go away," said he. \n\n"No, no. I'll go out to them," said Princess \nMary, and in spite of the nurse's and Dunyd- \nsha's protests she went out into the porch; \nDron, Dunydsha, the nurse, and Michael Ivdn- \novich following her. \n\n"They probably think I am offering them \nthe grain to bribe them to remain here, while \nI myself go away leaving them to the mercy of \nthe French," thought Princess Mary. "I will \noffer them monthly rations and housing at our \nMoscow estate. I am sure Andrew would do \neven more in rny place," she thought as she \nwent out in the twilight toward the crowd \nstanding on the pasture by the barn. \n\nThe men crowded closer together, stirred, \nand rapidly took off their hats. Princess Mary \nlowered her eyes and, tripping over her skirt, \ncame close up to them. So many different eyes, \nold and young, were fixed on her, and there \nwere so many different faces, that she could \nnot distinguish any of them and, feeling that \nshe must speak to them all at once, did not \nknow how to do it. But again the sense that she \nrepresented her father and her brother gave \nher courage, and she boldly began her speech. \n\n"I am very glad you have come," she said \nwithout raising her eyes, and feeling her heart \nbeating quickly and violently. "Dronushka \ntells me that the war has ruined you. That is \nour common misfortune, and I shall grudge \nnothing to help you. I am myself going away \nbecause it is dangerous here . . . the enemy is \nnear . . . because ... I am giving you every- \nthing, my friends, and I beg you to take every- \nthing, all our grain, so that you may not suffer \nwant! And if you have been told that I am giv- \ning you the grain to keep you here that is not \ntrue. On the contrary, I ask you to go with all \nyour belongings to our estate near Moscow, \nand I promise you I will see to it that there you \nshall want for nothing. You shall be given \nfood and lodging." \n\nThe princess stopped. Sighs were the only \nsound heard in the crowd. \n\n"I am not doing this on my own account," \nshe continued, "I do it in the name of my dead \nfather, who was a good master to you, and of \nmy brother and his son." \n\nAgain she paused. No one broke the silence. \n\n"Ours is a common misfortune and we will \nshare it together. All that is mine is yours," she \nconcluded, scanning the faces before her. \n\n\n\n416 \n\n\n\nAll eyes were gazing at her with one and the \nsame expression. She could not fathom wheth- \ner it was curiosity, devotion, gratitude, or ap- \nprehension and distrust but the expression \non all the faces was identical. \n\n"We are all very thankful for your bounty, \nbut it won't do for us to take the landlord's \ngrain," said a voice at the back of the crowd. \n\n"But why not?" asked the princess. \n\nNo one replied and Princess, Mary, looking \nround at the crowd, found that every eye she \nmet now was immediately dropped. \n\n"But why don't you want to take it?" she \nasked again. \n\nNo one answered. \n\nThe silence began to oppress the princess \nand she tried to catch someone's eye. \n\n"Why don't you speak?" she inquired of a \nvery old man who stood just in front of her \nleaning on his stick. "If you think something \nmore is wanted, tell mel I will do anything," \nsaid she, catching his eye. \n\nBut as if this angered him, he bent his head \nquite low and muttered: \n\n"Why should we agree? We don't want the \ngrain." \n\n"Why should we give up everything? We \ndon't agree. Don't agree. . . . We are sorry for \nyou, but we're not willing. Go away yourself, \nalone . . ." came from various sides of the crowd. \n\nAnd again all the faces in that crowd bore \nan identical expression, though now it was \ncertainly not an expression of curiosity or grati- \ntude, but of angry resolve. \n\n"But you can't have understood me," said \nPrincess Mary with a sad smile. "Why don't \nyou want to go? I promise to house and feed \nyou, while here the enemy would ruin you " \n\nBut her voice was drowned by the voices of \nthe crowd. \n\n"We're not willing. Let them ruin us! We \nwon't take your grain. We don't agree." \n\nAgain Princess Mary tried to catch some- \none's eye, but not a single eye in the crowd was \nturned to her; evidently they were all trying to \navoid her look. She felt strange and awkward. \n\n"Oh yes, an artful tale! Follow her into \nslavery! Pull down your houses and go into \nbondage! I dare say! Til give you grain, in- \ndeed!' she says," voices in the crowd were heard \nsaying. \n\nWith drooping head Princess Mary left the \ncrowd and went back to the house. Having re- \npeated her order to Dron to have horses ready \nfor her departure next morning, she went to \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\nher room and remained alone with her own \nthoughts. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII \n\nFOR A LONG TIME that night Princess Mary sat \nby the open window of her room hearing the \nsound of the peasants' voices that reached her \nfrom the village, but it was not of them she was \nthinking. She felt that she could not under- \nstand them however much she might think \nabout them. She thought only of one thing, \nher sorrow, which, after the break caused by \ncares for the present, seemed already to be- \nlong to the past. Now she could remember it \nand weep or pray. \n\nAfter sunset the wind had dropped. The \nnight was calm and fresh. Toward midnight \nthe voices began to subside, a cock crowed, the \nfull moon began to show from behind the lime \ntrees, a fresh white dewy mist began to rise, \nand stillness reigned over the village and the \nhouse. \n\nPictures of the near past her father's illness \nand last moments rose one after another to \nher memory. With mournful pleasure she now \nlingered over these images, repelling with hor- \nror only the last one, the picture of his death, \nwhich she felt she could not contemplate even \nin imagination at this still and mystic hour of \nnight. And these pictures presented themselves \nto her so clearly and in such detail that they \nseemed now present, now past, and now fu- \nture. \n\nShe vividly recalled the moment when he \nhad his first stroke and was being dragged \nalong by his armpits through the garden at \nBald Hills, muttering something with his help- \nless tongue, twitching his gray eyebrows and \nlooking uneasily and timidly at her. \n\n"Even then he wanted to tell me what he \ntold me the day he died," she thought. "He had \nalways thought what he said then." And she re- \ncalled in all its detail the night at Bald Hills \nbefore he had the last stroke, when with a fore- \nboding of disaster she had remained at home \nagainst his will. She had not slept and had \nstolen downstairs on tiptoe, and going to the \ndoor of the conservatory where he slept that \nnight had listened at the door. In a suffering \nand weary voice he was saying something to \nTikhon, speaking of the Crimea and its warm \nnights and of the Empress. Evidently he had \nwanted to talk. "And why didn't he call me? \nWhy didn't he let me be there instead of Tfk- \nlion?" Princess Mary had thought and thought \n\n\n\nBOOK TEN \n\n\n\n47 \n\n\n\nagain now. "Now he will never tell anyone \nwhat he had in his soul. Never will that mo- \nment return for him or for me when he might \nhave said all he longed to say, and not Tikhon \nbut I might have heard and understood him. \nWhy didn't I enter the room?" she thought. \n"Perhaps he would then have said to me what \nhe said the day he died. While talking to Tik- \nhon he asked about me twice. He wanted to see \nme, and I was standing close by, outside the \ndoor. It was sad and painful for him to talk to \nTikhon who did not understand him. I re- \nmember how he began speaking to him about \nLise as if she were alive he had forgotten she \nwas dead and Tikhon reminded him that she \nwas no more, and he shouted, Tool!' He was \ngreatly depressed. From behind the door I \nheard how he lay down on his bed groaning \nand loudly exclaimed, 'My God!' Why didn't I \ngo in then? What could he have done to me? \nWhat could I have lost? And perhaps he would \nthen have been comforted and would have \nsaid that word to me." And Princess Mary ut- \ntere^l aloud the caressing word he had said to \nher on the day of his death. "Dear-est!" she re- \npeated, and began sobbing, with tears that re- \nlieved her soul. She now saw his face before \nher. And not the face she had known ever since \nshe coujp remember and had always seen at a \ndistance, but the timid, feeble face she had \nseen for the first time quite closely, with all its \nwrinkles and details, when she stooped near to \nhis mouth to catch v;hat he said. \n\n"Dear-estl" she repeated again. \n\n"What was he thinking when he uttered that \nword? What is he thinking now?" This ques- \ntion suddenly presented itself to her, and in \nanswer she saw him before her with the expres- \nsion that was on his face as he lay in his coffin \nwith his chin bound up with a white handker- \nchief. And the horror that had seized her when \nshe touched him and convinced herself that \nthat was not he, but something mysterious and \nhorrible, seized her again. She tried to think of \nsomething else and to pray, but could do nei- \nther. With wide-open eyes she gazed at the \nmoonlight and the shadows, expecting every \nmoment to see his dead face, and she felt that \nthe silence brooding over the house and with- \nin it held her fast. \n\n"Dunydsha," she whispered. "Dunydshal" \nshe screamed wildly, and tearing herself out of \nthis silence she ran to the servants' quarters to \nmeet her old nurse and the maidservants who \ncame running toward her. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII \n\nON THE SEVENTEENTH OF AUGUST Rost6vand II- \nyin, accompanied by Lavrushka who had just \nreturned from captivity and by an hussar or- \nderly, left their quarters at Yank6vo, ten miles \nfrom Bogucharovo, and went for a ride to try \na new horse Ilyin had bought and to find out \nwhether there was any hay to be had in the \nvillages. \n\nFor the last three days Boguchdrovo had lain \nbetween the two hostile armies, so that it was \nas easy for the Russian rearguard to get to it as \nfor the French vanguard; Rostov, as a careful \nsquadron commander, wished to take such pro- \nvisions as remained at Bogucharovo before the \nFrench could get them. \n\nRostov and Ilyin were in the merriest of \nmoods. On the way to BogucMrovo, a princely \nestate with a dwelling house and farm where \nthey hoped to find many domestic serfs and \npretty girls, they questioned Lavrushka about \nNapoleon and laughed at his stories, and raced \none another to try Ilyfn's horse. \n\nRost6v had no idea that the village he was \nentering was the property of that very Bolkon- \nski who had been engaged to his sister. \n\nRostov and Ilyin gave rein to their horses for \na last race along the incline before reaching \nBogucMrovo, and Rostov, outstripping Ilyin, \nwas the first to gallop into the village street. \n\n"You're first!" cried Ilyfn, flushed. \n\n"Yes, always first both on the grassland and \nhere," answered Rostov, stroking his heated \nDonets horse. \n\n"And I'd have won on my Frenchy, your ex \ncellcncy," said Lavrushka from behind, allud- \ning to his shabby cart horse, "only I didn't wish \nto mortify you." \n\nThey rode at a footpace to the barn, where a \nlarge crowd of peasants was standing. \n\nSome of the men bared their heads, others \nstared at the new arrivals without doffing their \ncaps. Two tall old peasantswith wrinkled faces \nand scanty beards emerged from the tavern, \nsmiling, staggering, and singing some incoher- \nent song, and approached the officers. \n\n"Fine fellows!" said Rost6v laughing. "Is \nthere any hay here?" \n\n"And how like one another," said Ilyin. \n\n"A mo-o-st me-r-r-y co-o-m-pa . . .1" sang one \nof the peasants with a blissful smile. \n\nOne of the men came out of the crowd and \nwent up to Rostov. \n\n"Who do you belong to?" he asked. \n\n"The French," replied Ilyin jestingly, "and \n\n\n\n418 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nhere is Napoleon himself" and he pointed to \nLavriishka. \n\n"Then you are Russians?" the peasant asked \nagain. \n\n"And is there a large force of you here?" said \nanother, a short man, coming up. \n\n"Very large," answered Rost6v. "But why \nhave you collected here?" he added. "Is it a \nholiday?" \n\n"The old men have met to talk over the busi- \nness of the commune," replied the peasant, \nmoving away. \n\nAt that moment, on the road leading from \nthe big house, two women and a man in a white \nhat were seen coming toward the officers. \n\n"The one in pink is mine, so keep off!" said \nIlyin on seeing Dunysha running resolutely \ntoward him. \n\n"She'll be ours!" said Lavriishka to Ilyin, \nwinking. \n\n"What do you want, ray pretty?" said Ilyin \nwith a smile. \n\n"The princess ordered me to ask your regi- \nment and your name." \n\n"This is Count Rost6v, squadron command- \ner, and I am your humble servant." \n\n"Co-o-om-pa-nyl" roared the tipsy peasant \nwith a beatific smile as he looked at Ilyin talk- \ning to the girl. Following Dunydsha, Alpatych \nadvanced to Rost6v, having bared his head \nwhile still at a distance. \n\n"May I make bold to trouble your honor?" \nsaid he respectfully, but with a shade of con- \ntempt for the youthfulness of this officer and \nwith a hand thrust into his bosom. "My mistress, \ndaughter of General in Chief Prince Nicholas \nBolk6nski who died on the fifteenth of this \nmonth, finding herself in difficulties owing to \nthe boorishness of these people" he pointed \nto the peasants "asks you to come up to the \nhouse. . . . Won't you, please, ride on a little \nfarther," said Alpdtych with a melancholy \nsmile, "as it is not convenient in the presence \nof ... ?" He pointed to the two peasants who \nkept as close to him as horseflies to a horse. \n\n"Ahl . . . Alpdtych ... Ah, Ydkov Alpdtych \n. . . Grand! Forgive us for Christ's sake, eh?" \nsaid the peasants, smiling joyfully at him. \n\nRost6v looked at the tipsy peasants and \nsmiled. \n\n"Or perhaps they amuse your honor?" re- \nmarked Alpdtychwith a staid air, as he pointed \nat the old men with his free hand. \n\n"No, there's not much to be amused at here," \nsaid Rostov, and rode on a little way. "What's \nthe matter?" he asked. \n\n\n\n"I make bold to inform your honor that the \nrude peasants here don't wish to let the mis- \ntress leave the estate, and threaten to unharness \nher horses, so that though everything has been \npacked up since morning, her excellency can- \nnot get away." \n\n"Impossible!" exclaimed Rost6v. \n\n"I have the honor to report to you the actual \ntruth," said Alpdtych. \n\nRost6v dismounted, gave his horse to the or- \nderly, and followed Alpatych to the house, \nquestioning him as to the state of affairs. It ap- \npeared that the princess' offer of corn to the \npeasants the previous day, and her talk with \nDron and at the meeting, had actually had so \nbad an effect that Dron had finally given up \nthe keys and joined the peasants and had not \nappeared when Alpdtych sent for him; and \nthat in the morning when the princess gave or- \nders to harness for her journey, the peasants \nhad come in a large crowd to the barn and sent \nword that they would not let her leave the vil- \nlage: that there was an order not to move, and \nthat they would unharness the horses. Alpdtych \nhad gone out to admonish them, but was told \n(it was chiefly Karp who did the talking, Dron \nnot showing himself in the crowd) that they \ncould not let the princess go, that there was an \norder to the contrary, but that if she stayed \nthey would serve her as before and obey her \nin everything. \n\nAt the moment when Rost6v and Ilyfn were \ngalloping along the road, Princess Mary, de- \nspite the dissuasions of Alpatych, her nurse, and \nthe maids, had given orders to harness and in- \ntended to start, but when the cavalrymen were \nespied they were taken for Frenchmen, the \ncoachman ran away, and the women in the \nhouse began to wail. \n\n"Father! Benefactor! God has sent you!" ex- \nclaimed deeply moved voices as Rostov passed \nthrough the anteroom. \n\nPrincess Mary was sitting helpless and be- \nwildered in the large sitting room, when Ros- \nt6v was shown in. She could not grasp who he \nwas and why he had come, or what was happen- \ning to her. When she saw his Russian face, and \nby his walk and the first words he uttered rec- \nognized him as a man of her own class, she \nglanced at him with her deep radiant look and \nbegan speaking in a voice that faltered and \ntrembled with emotion. This meeting imme- \ndiately struck Rost6v as a romantic event. "A \nhelpless girl overwhelmed with grief, left to the \nmercy of coarse, rioting peasants! And what a \nstrange fate sent me here! What gentleness and \n\n\n\nBOOK TEN \n\n\n\n4'9 \n\n\n\nnobility there are in her features and expres- \nsion!" thought he as he looked at her and lis- \ntened to her timid story. \n\nWhen she began to tell him that all this had \nhappened the day after her father's funeral, her \nvoiced trembled. She turned away, and then, \nas if fearing he might take her words as meant \nto move him to pity, looked at him with an ap- \nprehensive glance of inquiry. There were tears \nin Rost6v's eyes. Princess Mary noticed this \nand glanced gratefully at him with that radiant \nlook which caused the plainness of her face to \nbe forgotten. \n\n"I cannot express, Princess, how glad I am \nthat I happened to ride here and am able to \nshow my readiness to serve you," said Rost6v, \nrising. "Go when you please, and I give you my \nword of honor that no one shall dare to cause \nyou annoyance if only you will allow me to \nact as your escort." And bowing respectfully, \nas if to a lady of royal blood, he moved toward \nthe door. \n\nRost6v's deferential tone seemed to indicate \nthat though he would consider himself happy \nto be acquainted with her, he did not wish to \ntake advantage of her misfortunes to intrude \nupon her. \n\nPrincess Mary understood this and appreci- \nated his delicacy. \n\n"I am very, very grateful to you," she said in \nFrench, "but I hope it was all a misunderstand- \ning and that no one is to blame for it." She sud- \ndenly began to cry. \n\n"Excuse me!" she said. \n\nRost6v, knitting his brows, left the room \nwith another low bow. \n\nCHAPTER XIV \n\nWELL, is she pretty? Ah, friendmy pink one \nis delicious; her name is Dunydsha " \n\nBut on glancing at Rostov's face Ilyin \nstopped short. He saw that his hero and com- \nmander was following quite a different train \nof thought. \n\nRostov glanced angrily at Ilyf n and without \nreplying strode off with rapid steps to the vil- \nlage. \n\n"I'll show them; I'll give it to them, the brig- \nands 1" said he to himself. \n\nAlpdtych at a gliding trot, only just manag- \ning not to run,kept up with him with difficulty. \n\n"What decision have you been pleased to \ncome to?" said he. \n\nRost6v stopped and, clenching his fists, sud- \ndenly and sternly turned on Alpdtych. \n\n"Decision? What decision? Old dotardl . . ." \n\n\n\ncried he. "What have you been about? Eh? The \npeasants are rioting, and you can't manage \nthem? You're a traitor yourself 1 1 knowyou. I'll \nflay you all alive! . . ."And as if afraid of wasting \nhis store of anger, he left Alpltych and went \nrapidly forward. Alpdtych, mastering his of- \nfended feelings, kept pace with Rost6v at a \ngliding gait and continued to impart his views. \nHe said the peasants were obdurate and that at \nthe present moment it would be imprudent to \n"overresist" them without an armed force, and \nwould it not be better first to send for the mil- \nitary? \n\n"I'll give them armed force . . . I'll 'overresist' \nthem!" uttered Rost6v meaninglessly, breath- \nless with irrational animal fury and the need \nto vent it. \n\nWithout considering what he would do he \nmoved unconsciously with quick, resolute steps \ntoward the crowd. And the nearer he drew to \nit the more Alpdtych felt that this unreason- \nable action might produce good results. The \npeasants in the crowd were similarly impressed \nwhen they saw Rostov's rapid, firm steps and \nresolute, frowning face. \n\nAfter the hussars had come to the village and \nRostov had gone to see the princess, a certain \nconfusion and dissension had arisen among the \ncrowd. Some of the peasants said that these \nnew arrivals were Russians and might take it \namiss that the mistress was beingdetained. Dron \nwas of this opinion, but as soon as he expressed \nit Karp and others attacked their ex-Elder. \n\n"How many years have you been fattening \non the commune?" Karp shouted at him. "It's \nall one to you! You'll dig up your pot of money \nand take it away with you. . . . What does it \nmatter to you whether our homes are ruined \nor not?" \n\n"We've been told to keep order, and that no \none is to leave their homes or take away a sin- \ngle grain, and that's all about it!" cried anoth- \ner. \n\n"It was your son's turn to be conscripted, but \nno fear! You begrudged your lump of a son," a \nlittle old man suddenly began attacking Dron \n"and so they took my Viinka to be shaved for \na soldier! But we all have to die." \n\n"To be sure, we all have to die. I'm not \nagainst the commune," said Dron. \n\n"That's it not against ill You've filled your \nbelly. . . ." \n\nThe two tall peasants had their say. As soon \nas Rost6v, followed by Ilyfn, Lavriishka, and \nAlpdtych, came up to the crowd, Karp, thrust- \ning his fingers into his belt and smiling a lit- \n\n\n\n420 \n\n\n\ntie, walked to the front. Dron on the contrary \nretired to the rear and the crowd drew closer \ntogether. \n\n"Who is your Elder here? Hey?" shouted \nRostdv, coming up to the crowd with quick \nsteps. \n\n"The Elder? What do you want with \nhim? . . ." asked Karp. \n\nBut before the words were well out of his \nmouth, his cap flew off and a fierce blow jerked \nhis head to one side. \n\n"Caps off, traitors!" shouted Rost6v in a \nwrathful voice. "Where's the Elder?" he cried \nfuriously. \n\n"The Elder. ... He wants the Eldcrl . . . \nDron Zakharych, you!" meek and flustered \nvoices here and there were heard calling and \ncaps began to come off their heads. \n\n"We don't riot, we're following the orders," \ndeclared Karp, and at that moment several \nvoices began speaking together. \n\n"It's as the old men have decided there's \ntoo many of you giving orders." \n\n"Arguing? Mutiny! . . . Brigands! Traitors!" \ncried Rostov unmeaningly in a voice not his \nown, gripping Karp by the collar. "Bind him, \nbind him!" he shouted, though there was no \none to bind him but Lavriishka and Alpdtych. \n\nLavrushka, however, ran up to Karp and \nseized him by the arms from behind. \n\n"Shall I call up our men from beyond the \nhill?" he called out. \n\nAlpiitych turned to the peasants and ordered \ntwo of them by name to come and bind Karp. \nThe men obediently came out of the crowd \nand began taking off their belts. \n\n"Where's the Elder?" demanded Rost6v in a \nloud voice. \n\nWith a pale and frowning face Dron stepped \nout of the crowd. \n\n"Are you the Elder? Bind him, Lavrushkal" \nshouted Rost6v, as if that order, too, could not \npossibly meet with any opposition. \n\nAnd in fact two more peasants began bind- \ning Dron, who took off his own belt and hand- \ned it to them, as if to aid them. \n\n"And you all listen to me!" said Rost6v to \nthe peasants. "Be off to your houses at once, \nand don't let one of your voices be heard! " \n\n"Why, we've not done any harm! We did it \njust out of foolishness. It's all nonsense. ... I \nsaid then that it was not in order," voices were \nheard bickering with one another. \n\n"There! What did I say?" said Alpdtych, \ncoming into his own again. "It's wrong, lads!" \n\n"All our stupidity, Ykov Alpdtych," came \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\nthe answers, and the crowd began at once to \ndisperse through the village. \n\nThe two bound men were led off to the mas- \nter's house. The two drunken peasants followed \nthem. \n\n"Aye, when I look at you! . . ." said one of \nthem to Karp. \n\n"How can one talk to the masters like that? \nWhat were you thinking of, you fool?" added \nthe other "A real iool!" \n\nTwo hours later the carts were standing in \nthe courtyard of the Boguchdrovo house. The \npeasants were briskly carrying out the propri- \netor's goods and packing themon the carts, and \nDron, liberated at Princess Mary's wish from \nthe cupboard where he had been confined, was \nstanding in the yard directing the men. \n\n"Don't put it in so carelessly," said oneof the \npeasants, a man with a round smiling face, tak- \ning a casket from a housemaid. "You know it \nhas cost money! How can you chuck it in like \nthat or shove it under the cord where it'll get \nrubbed? I don't like that way of doing things. \nLet it all be done properly, according to rule. \nLook here, put it under the bast matting and \ncover it with hay that's the way!" \n\n"Eh, books, books!" said another peasant, \nbringing out Prince Andrew's library cup- \nboards. "Don't catch up against it! It's heavy, \nlads solid books." \n\n"Yes, they worked all day and didn't play!" \nremarked the tall, round-faced peasant gravely, \npointing with a significant wink at the diction- \naries that were on the top. \n\n\n\nUnwilling to obtrude himself on the prin- \ncess, Rost6v did not go back to the house but \nremained in the village awaiting her depar- \nture. When her carriage drove out of the house, \nhe mounted and accompanied her eight miles \nfrom Boguchdrovo to where the road was occu- \npied by our troops. At the inn at Yank6vo he \nrespectfully took leave of her, for the first time \npermitting himself to kiss her hand. \n\n"How can you speak so!" he blushingly re- \nplied to Princess Mary's expressions of grati- \ntude for her deliverance, as she termed what \nhad occurred. "Any police officer would have \ndone as much! If we had had only peasants to \nfight, we should not have let the enemy come \nso far," said he with a sense of shame and wish- \ning to change the subject. "I am only happy to \nhave had the opportunity of making your ac- \nquaintance. Good-by, Princess. I wish you hap- \npiness and consolation and hope to meet you \nagain in happier circumstances. If you don't \n\n\n\nBOOK TEN \n\n\n\n421 \n\n\n\nwant to make me blush, please don't thank \nme!" \n\nBut the princess, if she did not again thank \nhim in words, thanked him with the whole ex- \npression of her face, radiant with gratitude and \ntenderness. She could not believe that there \nwas nothing to thank him for. On the contrary, \nit seemed to her certain that had he not been \nthere she would have perished at the hands of \nthe mutineers and of the French, and that he \nhad exposed himself to terrible and obvious \ndanger to save her, and even more certain was \nit that he was a man of lofty and noble soul, \nable to understand her position and her sor- \nrow. His kind, honest eyes, with the tears ris- \ning in them when she herself had begun to cry \nas she spoke of her loss, did not leave her mem- \nory. \n\nWhen she had taken leave of him and re- \nmained alone she suddenly felt her eyes filling \nwith tears, and then not for the first time the \nstrange question presented itself to her: did \nshe love him? \n\nOn the rest of the way to Moscow, though \nthe princess' position was not a cheerful one, \nDunyasha, who went with her in the carriage, \nmore than once noticed that her mistress leaned \nout of the window and smiled at something \nwith an expression of mingled joy and sorrow. \n\n"Well, supposing I do love him?" thought \nPrincess Mary. \n\nAshamed as she was of acknowledging to her- \nself that she had fallen in love with a man who \nwould perhaps never love her, she comforted \nherself with the thought that no one would \never know it and that she would not be to \nblame if, without ever speaking of it to any- \none, she continued to the end of her life to \nlove the man with whom she had fallen in love \nfor the first and last time in her life. \n\nSometimes when she recalled his looks, his \nsympathy, and his words, happiness did not \nappear impossible to her. It was at those mo- \nments that Dunyasha noticed her smiling as \nshe looked out of the carriage window. \n\n"Was it not fate that brought him to Bogu- \nchdrovo, and at that very moment?" thought \nPrincess Mary. "And that caused his sister to \nrefuse my brother?" 1 And in all this Princess \nMary saw the hand of Providence. \n\nThe impression the princess made on Ros- \nt6v was a very agreeable one. To remember \nher gave him pleasure, and when his comrades, \nhearing of his adventure at Boguchdrovo, ral- \n\n*A woman might not marry her brother's or \nsister's brother-in-law and vice versa. TR. \n\n\n\nlied him on having gone to look for hay and \nhaving picked up one of the wealthiest heiresses \nin Russia, he grew angry. It made him angry \njust because the idea of marrying the gentle \nPrincess Mary, who was attractive to him and \nhad an enormous fortune, had against his will \nmore than once entered his head. For himself \npersonally Nicholas could not wish for a better \nwife: by marrying her he would make the \ncountess his mother happy, would be able to \nput his father's affairs in order, and would even \nhe felt it ensure Princess Mary's happiness. \nBut Sonya? And his plighted word? That was \nwhy Rostov grew angry when he was rallied \nabout Princess Bolk6nskaya. \n\nCHAPTER XV \n\nON RECEIVING COMMAND of the armies Kutiizov \nremembered Prince Andrew and sent an order \nfor him to report at headquarters. \n\nPrince Andrew arrived at Tsdrevo-Zaymish- \nche on the very day and at the very hour that \nKutuzov was reviewing the troops for the first \ntime. He stopped in the village at the priest's \nhouse in front of which stood the commander \nin chief's carriage, and he sat down on the \nbench at the gate awaiting his Serene High- \nness, as everyone now called Kutuzov, From \nthe field beyond the village came now sounds \nof regimental music and now the roar of many \nvoices shouting "Hurrah!" to the new com- \nmander in chief. Two orderlies, a courier and \na major-domo, stood near by, some ten paces \nfrom Prince Andrew, availing themselves of \nKutiizov's absence and of the fine weather. A \nshort, swarthy lieutenant colonel of hussars \nwith thick mustaches and whiskers rode up \nto the gate and, glancing at Prince Andrew, in- \nquired whether his Serene Highness was put- \nting up there and whether he would soon be \nback. \n\nPrince Andrew replied that he was not on his \nSerene Highness' staff but was himself a new \narrival. The lieutenant colonel turned to a \nsmart orderly, who, with the peculiar contempt \nwith which a commander in chief's orderly \nspeaks to officers, replied: \n\n"What? His Serene Highness? I expect he'll \nbe here soon. What do you want?" \n\nThe lieutenant colonel of hussars smiled be- \nneath his mustache at the orderly's tone, dis- \nmounted, gave his horse to a dispatch runner, \nand approached Bolk6nski with a slight bow. \nBolk6nski made room for him on the bench \nand the lieutenant colonel sat down beside \nhim. \n\n\n\n422 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\n"You're also waiting for the commander in \nchief?" said he. "They say he weceives evewy- \none, thank Godl . . . It's awful with those sau- \nsage eaters! Ermolov had weason to ask to be \npwomoted to be a German! Now p'waps Wus- \nsians will get a look in. As it was, devil only \nknows what was happening. We kept wetweat- \ning and wetweating. Did you take part in the \ncampaign?" he asked. \n\n"I had the pleasure," replied Prince Andrew, \n"not only of taking part in the retreat but of \nlosing in that retreat all I held dear not to \nmention the estate and home of my birth my \nfather, who died of grief. I belong to the prov- \nince of Smolensk." \n\n"Ah? You're Pwince Bolk6nski? Vcwy glad \nto make your acquaintance! I'm Lieutenant \nColonel Denfsov, better known as 'Vaska,' " \nsaid Denisov, pressing Prince Andrew's hand \nand looking into his face with a particularly \nkindly attention. "Yes, I heard," said he sym- \npathetically, and after a short pause added: \n"Yes, it's Scythian warfare. It's all vcwy well \nonly not for those who get it in the neck. \nSo you are Pwince Andwew Bolk6nski?" He \nswayed his head. "Vewy pleased, Pwince, to \nmake your acquaintance!" he repeated again, \nsmiling sadly, and he again pressed Prince An- \ndrew's hand. \n\nPrince Andrew knew Denisov from what Na- \ntasha had told him of her first suitor. This \nmemory carried him sadly and sweetly back to \nthose painful feelings of which he had not \nthought lately, but which still found place in \nhis souL Of late he had received so many new \nand very serious impressions such as the re- \ntreat from Smolensk, his visit to Bald Hills, \nand the recent news of his father's death and \nhad experienced so many emotions, that for a \nlong time past those memories had not entered \nhis mind, and now that they did, they did not \nact on him with nearly their former strength. \nFor Denisov, too, the memories awakened by \nthe name of Bolk6nski belonged to a distant, \nromantic past, when after supper and after \nNatasha's singing he had proposed to a little \ngirl of fifteen without realizing what he was \ndoing. He smiled at the recollection of that \ntime and of his love for Natdsha, and passed at \nonce to what now interested him passionately \nand exclusively. This was a plan of campaign \nhe had devised while serving at the outposts \nduring the retreat. He had proposed that plan \nto Barclay de Tolly and now wished to pro- \npose it to Kutiizov. The plan was based on the \nfact that the French line of operation was too \n\n\n\nextended, and it proposed that instead of, or \nconcurrently with, action on the front to bar \nthe advance of the French, we should attack \ntheir line of communication. He began ex- \nplaining his plan to Prince Andrew. \n\n"They can't hold all that line. It's impossible. \nI will undertake to bweak thwough. Give me \nfive hundwed men and I will bweak the line, \nthat's certain! There's only one way guewilla \nwarfare!" \n\nDenisov rose and began gesticulating as he \nexplained his plan to Bolk6nski. In the midst \nof his explanation shouts were heard from the \narmy, growing more incoherent and more dif- \nfused, mingling with music and songs and com- \ning from the field where the review was held. \nSounds of hoofs and shouts were nearing the \nvillage. \n\n"He's coming! He's coming!" shouted a Cos- \nsack standing at the gate. \n\nBolk6nski and Denisov moved to the gate, at \nwhich a knot of soldiers (a guard of honor) was \nstanding, and they saw Kutiizov coming down \nthe street mounted on a rather small sorrel \nhorse. A huge suite of generals rode behind \nhim. Barclay was riding almost beside him, and \na crowd of officers ran after and around them \nshouting, "Hurrah!" \n\nHis adjutants galloped into the yard be- \nfore him. Kutiizov was impatiently urging on \nhis horse, which ambled smoothly under his \nweight, and he raised his hand to his white \nHorse Guard's cap with a red band and no \npeak, nodding his head continually. When he \ncame up to the guard of honor, a fine set of \nGrenadiers mostly wearing decorations, who \nwere giving him the salute, he looked at them \nsilently and attentively for nearly a minute \nwith the steady gaze of a commander and then \nturned to the crowd of generals and officers \nsurrounding him. Suddenly his face assumed \na subtle expression, he shrugged his shoulders \nwith an air of perplexity. \n\n"And with such fine fellows to retreat and \nretreat! Well, good-by, General," he added, \nand rode into the yard past Prince Andrew and \nDenisov. \n\n"Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah! "shouted those be- \nhind him. \n\nSince Prince Andrew had last seen him Ku- \ntiizov had grown still more corpulent, flaccid, \nand fat. But the bleached eyeball, the scar, and \nthe familiar weariness of his expression were \nstill the same. He was wearing the white Horse \nGuard's cap and a military overcoat with a \nwhip hanging over his shoulder by a thin strap. \n\n\n\nBOOK TEN \n\n\n\n423 \n\n\n\nHe sat heavily and swayed limply on his brisk \nlittle horse. \n\n"Whew . . . whew . . . whew I" he whistled \njust audibly as he rode into the yard. His face \nexpressed the relief of relaxed strain felt by a \nman who means to rest after a ceremony. He \ndrew his left foot out of the stirrup and, lurch- \ning with his whole body and puckering his face \nwith the effort, raised it with difficulty onto the \nsaddle, leaned on his knee, groaned, and si ipped \ndown into the arms of the Cossacks and adju- \ntants who stood ready to assist him. \n\nHe pulled himself together, looked round, \nscrewing up his eyes, glanced at Prince An- \ndrew, and, evidently not recognizing him, \nmoved with his waddling gait to the porch. \n"Whew . . . whew . . . whew!" he whistled, and \nagain glanced at Prince Andrew. As often oc- \ncurs with old men, it was only after some sec- \nonds that the impression produced by Prince \nAndrew's face linked itself up with Kutiizov's \nremembrance of his personality. \n\n"Ah, how do you do, my dear prince? How \ndo you do, my dear boy? Come along . . ." said \nhe, glancing wearily round, and he stepped on- \nto the porch which creaked under his weight. \n\nHe unbuttoned his coat and sat down on a \nbench in the porch. \n\n"And how's your father?" \n\n"I received news of his death, yesterday," re- \nplied Prince Andrew abruptly. \n\nKutuzov looked at him with eyes wide open \nwith dismay and then took off his cap and \ncrossed himself: \n\n"May the kingdom of Heaven be hisl God's \nwill be done to us all!" He sighed deeply, his \nwhole chest heaving, and was silent for a while. \n"I loved him and respected him, and sympa- \nthize with you with all my heart." \n\nHe embraced Prince Andrew, pressing him \nto his fat breast, and for some time did not let \nhim go. When he released him Prince Andrew \nsaw that Kutuzov's flabby lips were trembling \nand that tears were in his eyes, He sighed and \npressed on the bench with both hands to \nraise himself. \n\n"Cornel Come with me, we'll have a talk," \nsaid he. \n\nBut at that moment Denfsov, no more in- \ntimidated by his superiors than by the enemy, \ncame with jingling spurs up the steps of the \nporch, despite the angry whispers of the ad- \njutants who tried to stop him. Kutuzov, his \nhands still pressed on the seat, glanced at him \nglumly. Denfsov, having given his name, an- \nnounced that he had to communicate to his \n\n\n\nSerene Highness a matter of great importance \nfor their country's welfare. Kutuzov looked \nwearily at him arid, lifting his hands with a \ngesture of annoyance, folded them across his \nstomach, repeating the words: "For our coun- \ntry's welfare? Well, what is it? Speak!" Den- \nisov blushed like a girl (it was strange to see \nthe color rise in that shaggy, bibulous, time- \nworn face) and boldly began to expound his \nplan of cutting the enemy's lines of communi- \ncation between Smolensk and Vydzma. Denisov \ncame from those parts and knew the country \nwell. His plan seemed decidedly a good one, es- \npecially from the strength of conviction with \nwhich he spoke. Kutuzov looked down at his \nown legs, occasionally glancing at the door of \nthe adjoining hut as if expecting something \nunpleasant to emerge from it. And from that \nhut, while Denfsov was speaking, a general with \na portfolio under his arm really did appear. \n\n"What?" said Kutuzov, in the midst of Den- \nisov 's explanations, "are you ready so soon?" \n\n"Ready, your Serene Highness," replied the \ngeneral. \n\nKutuzov swayed his head, as much as to say: \n"How is one man to deal with it all?" and \nagain listened to Denfsov. \n\n"I give my word of honor as a Wussian of- \nficer," said Denfsov, "that I can bweak Na- \npoleon's line of communication!" \n\n"What relation are you to Intendant Gen- \neral Kirfl A ndre*evich Denisov?" asked Kutuzov, \ninterrupting him. \n\n"He is my uncle, your Sewene Highness." \n\n"Ah, we were friends," said Kutuzov cheer- \nfully. "All right, all right, friend, stay here at \nthe staff and tomorrow we'll have a talk." \n\nWith a nod to Denfsov he turned away and \nput out his hand for the papers Konovnftsyn \nhad brought him. \n\n"Would not your Serene Highness like to \ncome inside?" said the general on duty in a dis- \ncontented voice, "the plans must be examined \nand several papers have to be signed." \n\nAn adjutant came out and announced that \neverything was in readiness within. But Kutu- \nzov evidently did not wish to enter that room \ntill he was disengaged. He made a grimace \n\n"No, tell them to bring a small table out \nhere, my dear boy. I'll look at them here," said \nhe. "Don't go away," he added, turning to \nPrince Andrew, who remained in the porch \nand listened to the general's report. \n\nWhile this was being given, Prince Andrew \nheard the whisper of a woman's voice and the \nrustle of a silk dress behind the door. Several \n\n\n\n424 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\ntimes on glancing that way he noticed behind \nthat door a plump, rosy, handsome woman in \na pink dress with a lilac silk kerchief on her \nhead, holding a dish and evidently awaiting \nthe entrance of the commander in chief. Ku- \ntuzov's adjutant whispered to Prince Andrew \nthat this was the wite of the priest whose home \nit was, and that she intended to offer his Se- \nrene Highness bread and salt. "Her husband \nhas welcomed his Serene Highness with the \ncross at the church, and she intends to wel- \ncome him in the house. , . . She's very pretty," \nadded the adjutant with a smile. At those words \nKutuzov looked round. He was listening to the \ngeneral's reportwhich consisted chiefly of a \ncriticism of the position at Tsarevo-Zay- \nmishche as he had listened to Denfsov, and \nseven years previously had listened to the dis- \ncussion at the Austerlitz council of war. He \nevidently listened only because he had ears \nwhich, though there was a piece of tow in one \nof them, could not help hearing; but it was ev- \nident that nothing the general could say would \nsurprise or even interest him, that he knew all \nthat would be said beforehand, and heard it all \nonly because he had to, as one has to listen to \nthe chanting of a service of prayer. All that \nDenisov had said was clever and to the point. \nWhat the general was saying was even more \nclever and to the point, but it was evident that \nKutuzov despised knowledge and cleverness, \nand knew of something else that would decide \nthe matter something independent of clever- \nness and knowledge. Prince Andrew watched \nthe commander in chief's face attentively, and \nthe only expression he could see there was one \nof boredom, curiosity as to the meaning of the \nfeminine whispering behind the door, and a \ndesire to observe propriety. It was evident that \nKutuzov despised cleverness and learning and \neven the patriotic feeling shown by Denisov, \nbut despised them not because of his own in- \ntellect, feelings, or knowledge he did not try \nto display any of these but because of some- \nthing else. He despised them because of his \nold age and experience of life. The only in- \nstruction Kutuzov gave of his own accord dur- \ning that report referred to looting by the Rus- \nsian troops. At the end of the report the gen- \neral put before him for signature a paper re- \nlating to the recovery of payment from army \ncommanders for green oats mown down by the \nsoldiers, when landowners lodged petitions \nfor compensation. \n\nAfter hearing the matter, Kutiizov smacked \nhis lips together and shook his head. \n\n\n\n"Into the stove . . . into the fire with itl I tell \nyou once for all, my dear fellow," said he, "in- \nto the fire with all such things! Let them cut \nthe crops and burn wood to their hearts' con- \ntent. I don't order it or allow it, but I don't \nexact compensation either. One can't get on \nwithout it. 'When wood is chopped the chips \nwill fly.' " He looked at the paper again. "Oh, \nthis German precision!" he muttered, shaking \nhis head. \n\nCHAPTER XVI \n\n"WELL, THAT'S ALL!" said Kutiizov as he signed \nthe last of the documents, and rising heavily \nand smoothing out the folds in his fat white \nneck he moved toward the door with a more \ncheerful expression. \n\nThe priest's wife, flushing rosy red, caught \nup the dish she had after all not managed to \npresent at the right moment, though she had \nso long been preparing for it, and with a low \nbow offered it to Kutuzov. \n\nHe screwed up his eyes, smiled, lifted her \nchin with his hand, and said: \n\n"Ah, what a beauty I Thank you, sweetheart!" \n\nHe took some gold pieces from his trouser \npocket and put them on the dish for her. \n"Well, my dear, and how are we getting on?" \nhe asked, moving to the door of the room as- \nsigned to him. The priest's wife smiled, and \nwith dimples in her rosy cheeks followed him \ninto the room. The adjutant came out to the \nporch and asked Prince Andrew to lunch with \nhim. Half an hour later Prince Andrew was \nagain called to Kutuzov. He found him reclin- \ning in an armchair, still in the same unbut- \ntoned overcoat. He had in his hand a French \nbook which he closed as Prince Andrew en- \ntered, marking the place with a knife. Prince \nAndrew saw by the cover that it was Les Chev- \naliers du Cygne by Madame de Genlis. \n\n"Well, sit clown, sit down here. Let's have a \ntalk," said Kutuzov. "It's sad, very sad. But re- \nmember, my clear fellow, that I am a father to \nyou, a second father. . . ." \n\nPrince Andrew told Kutuzov all he knew of \nhis father's death, and what he had seen at \nBald Hills when he passed through it. \n\n"What . . . what they have brought us to!" \nKutuzov suddenly cried in an agitated voice, \nevidently picturing vividly to himself from \nPrince Andrew's story the condition Russia was \nin. "But give me time, give me time!" he said \nwith a grim look, Evidently not wishing to con- \ntinue this agitating conversation, and added: \n"I sent for you to keep you with me." \n\n\n\nBOOK \n\n"I thank your Serene Highness, but I fear I \nam no longer fit for the staff," replied Prince \nAndrew with a smile which Kuttizov noticed. \n\nKutuzov glanced inquiringly at him. \n\n"But above all," added Prince Andrew, "I \nhave grown used to my regiment, am fond of \nthe officers, and I fancy the men also like me. I \nshould be sorry to leave the regiment. If I de- \ncline the honor of being with you, believe \nme . . ." \n\nA shrewd, kindly, yet subtly derisive expres- \nsion lit up Kutuzov's podgy face. He cut Bol- \nk6nski short. \n\n"I am sorry, for I need you. But you're right, \nyou're right! It's not here that men are needed. \nAdvisers are always plentiful, but men are not. \nThe regiments would not be what they are if \nthe would-be advisers served there as you do. \nI remember you at Austerlitz. ... I remember, \nyes, I remember you with the standard!" said \nKutuzov, and a flush of pleasure suffused \nPrince Andrew's face at this recollection. \n\nTaking his hand and drawing him down- \nwards, Kutuzov offered his cheek to be kissed, \nand again Prince Andrew noticed tears in the \nold man's eyes. Though Prince Andrew knew \nthat Kutuzov's tears came easily, and that he \nwas particularly tender to and considerate of \nhim from a wish to show sympathy with his loss, \nyet this reminder of Austerlitz was both pleas- \nant and flattering to him. \n\n"Go your way and God be with you. I know \nyour path is the path of honor!" He paused. "I \nmissed you at Bucharest, but I needed some- \none to send." And changing the subject, Kutu- \nzov began to speak of the Turkish war and the \npeace that had been concluded. "Yes, I have \nbeen much blamed," he said, "both for that \nwar and the peace . . . but everything came at \nthe right time. Tout vient a point &amp; celui qui \nsalt attendre? And there were as many advisers \nthere as here . . ." he went on, returning to the \nsubject of "advisers" which evidently occupied \nhim. "Ah, those advisers!" said he. "If we had \nlistened to them all we should not have made \npeace with Turkey and should not have been \nthrough with that war. Everything in haste, \nbut more haste, less speed. Kamenski would \nhave been lost if he had not died. He \nstormed fortresses with thirty thousand men. \nIt is not difficult to capture a fortress but it is \ndifficult to win a campaign. For that, not storm- \ning and attacking but patience and time are \nwanted. Kdmenski sent soldiers to Rustchuk, \n\n1 "Everything comes in time to him who knows \nhow to wait," \n\n\n\nTEN 425 \n\nbut I only employed these two things and took \nmore fortresses than Kdmenski and made the \nTurks eat horseflesh I" He swayed his head. \n"And the French shall too, believe me," he \nwent on, growing warmer and beating his \nchest, "I'll make them eat horseflesh!" And \ntears again dimmed his eyes. \n\n"But shan't we have to accept battle?" re- \nmarked Prince Andrew. \n\n"We sha'll if everybody wants it; it can't be \n\nhelped But believe me, my dear boy, there \n\nis nothing stronger than those two: patience \nand time, they will do it all. But the advisers \nn'entendent pas de cette oreille, voiia le mal* \nSome want a thing others don't. What's one \nto do?" he asked, evidently expecting an an- \nswer. "Well, what do you want us to do?" he \nrepeated and his eye shone with a deep, shrewd \nlook. "I'll tell you what to do," he continued, \nas Prince Andrcwstill did not reply: "I will tell \nyou what to do, and what I do. Dans le doute, \nmon cher," he paused, "abstiens-toi" 8 he ar- \nticulated the French proverb deliberately. \n\n"Well, good-by, my dear fellow; remember \nthat with all my heart I share your sorrow, and \nthat for you I am not a Serene Highness, nor a \nprince, nor a commander in chief, but a father! \nIf you want anything come straight to me. \nGood-by, my dear boy." \n\nAgain he embraced and kissed Prince An- \ndrew, but before the latter had left the room \nKutuzov gave a sigh of relief and went on with \nhis unfinished novel, Les Chevaliers du Cygne \nby Madame de Gcnlis. \n\nPrince Andrew could not have explained \nhow or why it was, but after that interview \nwith Kutuzov he went back to his regiment re- \nassured as to the general course of affairs and \nas to the man to whom it had been entrusted. \nThe more he realized the absence of all per- \nsonal motive in that old man in whom there \nseemed to remain only the habit of passions, \nand in place of an intellect (grouping events \nand drawing conclusions) only the capacity \ncalmly to contemplate the course of events \nthe more reassured he was that everything \nwould be as it should. "He will not bring in \nany plan of his own. He will not devise or un- \ndertake anything," thought Prince Andrew, \n"but he will hear everything, remember every- \nthing, and put everything in its place. He will \nnot hinder anything useful nor allow anything \nharmful. He understands that there is some- \nthing stronger and more important than his \n\na "Don't see it that way, that's the trouble." \n\n8 "When in doubt, my dear fellow, do nothing," \n\n\n\n426 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nown will the inevitable course of events, and \nhe can see them and grasp their significance, \nand seeing that significance can refrain from \nmeddling and renounce his personal wish di- \nrected to something else. And above all," \nthought Prince Andrew, "one believes in him \nbecause he's Russian, despite the novel byGen- \nlis and the French proverbs, and because his \nvoice shook when he said: 'What they have \nbrought us to!' and had a sob in it when he \nsaid he would 'make them eat horseflesh!' " \n\nOn such feelings, more or less dimly shared \nby all, the unanimity and general approval \nwere founded with which, despite court influ- \nences, the popular choice of Kutiizov as com- \nmander in chief was received. \n\nCHAPTER XVII \n\nAFTER THE EMPEROR had left Moscow, life \nflowed on there in its usual course, and its \ncourse was so very usual that it was difficult to \nremember the recent days of patriotic elation \nand ardor, hard to believe that Russia was real- \nly in danger and that the members of the Eng- \nlish Club were also sons of the Fatherland \nready to sacrifice everything for it. The one \nthing that recalled the patriotic fervor every- \none had displayed during the Emperor's stay \nwas the call for contributions of men and \nmoney, a necessity that as soon as the prom- \nises had been made assumed a legal, official \nform and became unavoidable. \n\nWith the enemy's approach to Moscow, the \nMoscovites' view of their situation did not \ngrow more serious but on the contrary became \neven more frivolous, as always happens with \npeople who see a great danger approaching. \nAt the approach of danger there are always \ntwo voices that speak with equal power in the \nhuman soul: one very reasonably tells a man \nto consider the nature of the danger and the \nmeans of escaping it; the other, still more \nreasonably, says that it is too depressing and \npainful to think of the danger, since it is not \nin man's power to foresee everything and avert \nthe general course of events, and it is therefore \nbetter to disregard what is painful till it comes, \nand to think about what is pleasant. In solitude \na man generally listens to the first voice, but in \nsociety to the second. So it was now with the \ninhabitants of Moscow. It was long since peo- \nple had been as gay in Moscow as that year. \n\nRostopchin's broadsheets, headed by wood- \ncuts of a drink shop, a potman, and a Moscow \nburgher called Karpiishka Chigirin, "who \nhaving been a militiaman and having had rath- \n\n\n\ner too much at the pub heard that Napoleon \nwished to come to Moscow, grew angry , abused \nthe French in very bad language f came out of \nthe drink shop, and, under the sign of the ea- \ngle, began to address the assembled people" \nwere read and discussed, together with the lat- \nest of Vasfli Lvovich Pushkin's bouts rime's. \n\nIn the corner room at the Club, members \ngathered to read these broadsheets, and some \nliked the way Karpushka jeered at the French, \nsaying: "They will swell up with Russian cab- \nbage, burst with our buckwheat porridge, and \nchoke themselves with cabbage soup. They are \nall dwarfs and one peasant woman will toss \nthree of them with a hayfork/' Others did not \nlike that tone and said itwas stupid and vulgar. \nIt was said that Rostopchfn had expelled all \nFrenchmen and even all foreigners from Mos- \ncow, and that there had been some spies and \nagents of Napoleon among them; but this was \ntold chiefly to introduce Rostopchfn's witty re- \nmark on that occasion. The foreigners were \ndeported to Nizhni by boat, and Rostopchin \nhad said to them in French: "Rentrez en vous- \nmSmes; entrez dans la barque, et n'en faites \npas une barque de Charon." * There was talk \nof all the government offices having been al- \nready removed from Moscow, and to this Shin- \nshfn's witticism was added that for that alone \nMoscow ought to be grateful to Napoleon. It \nwas said that Mam6nov's regiment would cost \nhim eight hundred thousand rubles, and that \nBezukhov had spent even more on his, but that \nthe best thing about Beziikhov's action was \nthat he himself was going to don a uniform \nand ride at the head of his regiment without \ncharging anything for the show. \n\n"You don't spare anyone," said Julie Dru- \nbetskdya as she collected and pressed together \na bunch of raveled lint with her thin, beringed \nfingers. \n\nJulie was preparing to leave Moscow next \nday and was giving a farewell soiree. \n\n"Bezukhov est ridicule, but he is so kind and \ngood-natured. What pleasure is there to be so \ncaustique?" \n\n"A forfeit!" cried a young man in militia \nuniform whom Julie called "mon chevalier," \nand who was going with her to Nizhni. \n\nIn Julie's set, as in many other circles in Mos- \ncow, it had been agreed that they would speak \nnothing but Russian and that those who made \na slip and spoke French should pay fines to the \nCommittee of Voluntary Contributions. \n\n1 "Think it over; get into the barque, and take \ncare not to make it a barque of Charon." \n\n\n\nBOOK TEN \n\n\n\n4*7 \n\n\n\n"Another forfeit for a Gallicism/' said a Rus- \nsian writer who was present. " 'What pleasure \nis there to be' is not Russian I" \n\n"You spare no one," continued Julie to the \nyoung man without heeding the author's re- \nmark. * \n\n"For caustiqueI am guilty and will pay, \nand I am prepared to pay again for the pleas- \nure of telling you the truth. For Gallicisms I \nwon't be responsible," she remarked, turning to \nthe author: "I have neither the money nor the \ntime, like Prince GaHtsyn, to engage a master \nto teach me Russian!" \n\n"Ah, here he isl" she added. "Quand on ... \nNo, no," she said to the militia officer, "you \nwon't catch me. Speak of the sun and you see \nits rays I "and she smiled amiably at Pierre. "We \nwere just talking of you," she said with the fa- \ncility in lying natural to a society woman. "We \nwere saying that your regiment would be sure \nto be better than Mam6nov's." \n\n"Oh, don't talk to me of my regiment," re- \nplied Pierre, kissing his hostess' hand and tak- \ning a seat beside her. "I am so sick of it." \n\n"You will, of course, command it yourself?" \nsaid Julie, directing a sly, sarcastic glance to- \nward the militia officer, \n\nThe latter in Pierre's presence had ceased to \nbe caustic, and his face expressed perplexity \nas to what Julie's smile might mean. In spite \nof his absent-mindedness and good nature, Pi- \nerre's personality immediately checked any at- \ntempt to ridicule him to his face. \n\n"No," said Pierre, with a laughing glance at \nhis big, stout body. "I should make too good a \ntarget for the French, besides I am afraid I \nshould hardly be able to climb onto a horse." \n\nAmong those whom Julie's guests happened \nto choose to gossip about were the Rost6vs. \n\n"I hear that their affairs are in a very bad \nway," said Julie. "And he is so unreasonable, \nthe count himself I mean. The Razum6vskis \nwanted to buy his house and his estate near \nMoscow, but it drags on and on. He asks too \nmuch." \n\n"No, I think the sale will come off in a few \ndays," said someone, "Though it is madness to \nbuy anything in Moscow now." \n\n"Why?" asked Julie. "You don't think Mos- \ncow is in danger?" \n\n"Then why are you leaving?" \n\n"I? What a question! I am going because . . . \nwell, because everyone is going: and besides \nI am not Joan of Arc or an Amazon." \n\n"Well, of course, of course! Let me have \nsome more strips of linen." \n\n\n\n"If he manages the business properly he will \nbe able to pay off all his debts," said the militia \nofficer, speaking of Rost6v. \n\n"A kindly old man but not up to much. And \nwhy do they stay on so long in Moscow? They \nmeant to leave for the country long ago. Na- \ntalie is quite well again now, isn't she?" Julie \nasked Pierre with a knowing smile. \n\n"They are waiting for their younger son," \nPierre replied. "He joined Obotenski's Cos- \nsacks and went to Bdlaya Tsrkov where the \nregiment is being formed. But now they have \nhad him transferred to my regiment and are \nexpecting him every day. The count wanted to \nleave long ago, but the countess won't on any \naccount leave Moscow till her son returns." \n\n"I met them the day before yesterday at the \nArkharovs'. Natalie has recovered her looks and \nis brighter. She sang a song. How easily some \npeople get over everything!" \n\n"Get over what?" inquired Pierre, looking \ndispleased. \n\nJulie smiled. \n\n"You know, Count, such knights as you are \nonly found in Madame de Souza's novels." \n\n"What knights? What do you mean?" de- \nmanded Pierre, blushing. \n\n"Oh, come, my dear count! C'est la fable de \ntout Moscou. Je vous admire, ma parole d'hon- \nneur!" * \n\n"Forfeit, forfeit!" cried the militia officer. \n\n"All right, one can't talk how tiresome!" \n\n"What is 'the talk of all Moscow'?" Pierre \nasked angrily, rising to his feet. \n\n"Come now, Count, you know!" \n\n"I don't know anything about it," said Pi- \nerre. \n\n"I know you were friendly with Natalie, and \nso ... but I was always more friendly with Vera \nthat dear Wra." \n\n"No, madamel" Pierre continued in a tone \nof displeasure, "I have not taken on myself the \nrole of Natalie Rost6va's knight at all, and \nhave not been to their house for nearly a month. \nBut I cannot understand the cruelty . . ." \n\n"Qwe s' excuse s' accuse" a said Julie, smiling \nand waving the lint triumphantly, and to \nhave the last word she promptly changed the \nsubject. "Do you know what I heard today? \nPoor Mary Bolk6nskaya arrived in Moscow \nyesterday. Do you know that she has lost her \nfather?" \n\n"Really? Where is she? I should like very \n\n1 "It is the talk of all Moscow. My word, I ad- \nmire you!" \n* "Who excuses himself, accuses himself." \n\n\n\n428 \n\nmuch to see her," said Pierre. \n\n"I spent the evening with her yesterday. She \nis going to their estate near Moscow either to- \nday or tomorrow morning, with her nephew." \n\n"Well, and how is she?" asked Pierre. \n\n"She is well, but sad. But do you know who \nrescued her? It is quite a romance. Nicholas \nRost6v! She was surrounded, and they wanted \nto kill her and had wounded some of her peo- \nple. He rushed in and saved her. . . ." \n\n"Another romance," said the militia officer. \n"Really, this general flight has been arranged \nto get all the old maids married off. Catiche is \none and Princess Bolkonskaya another." \n\n"Do you know, I really believe she is un pe- \ntit pen amoureuse du jeune homme." 8 \n\n"Forfeit, forfeit, forfeit!" \n\n"But how could one say that in Russian?" \n\nCHAPTER XVIII \n\nWHEN PIERRE returned home he was handed \ntwo of Rostopchin's broadsheets that had been \nbrought that day. \n\nThe first declared that the report that Count \nRostopchin had forbidden people to leave \nMoscow was false; on the contrary he was glad \nthat ladies and tradesmen's wives were leaving \nthe city. "There will be less panic and less gos- \nsip," ran the broadsheet, "but I will stake my \nlifeon it that that scoundrel will not enter Mos- \ncow." These words showed Pierre clearly for \nthe first time that the French would enter Mos- \ncow. The second broadsheet stated that our \nheadquarters were at Vydzma, that Count Witt- \ngenstein had defeated the French, but that as \nmany of the inhabitants of Moscow wished to \nbe armed, weapons were ready for them at the \narsenal: sabers, pistols, and muskets which \ncould be had at a low price. The tone of the \nproclamation was not as jocose as in the former \nChigirin talks. Pierre pondered over these \nbroadsheets. Evidently the terrible stormcloud \nhe had desired with the whole strength of his \nsoul but which yet aroused involuntary horror \nin him was drawing near. \n\n"Shall I join the army and enter the service, \nor wait?" he asked himself for the hundredth \ntime. He took a pack of cards that lay on the \ntable and began to lay them out for a game of \npatience. \n\n"If this patience comes out," he said to him- \nself after shuffling the cards, holding them in \nhis hand, and lifting his head, "if it comes out, \nit means . . . what does it mean?" \n\nHe had not decided what it should mean \n\n8 "A little bit in love with the young man." \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nwhen he heard the voice of the eldest princess \nat the door asking whether she might come in. \n\n"Then it will mean that I must go to the ar- \nmy," said Pierre to himself. "Come in, come \nin!" he added to the princess. \n\nOnly the eldest princess, the one with the \nstony face and long waist, was still living in \nPierre's house. The two younger ones had both \nmarried. \n\n"Excuse my coming to you, cousin," she said \nin a reproachful and agitated voice. "You \nknow some decision must be come to. What is \ngoing to happen? Everyone has left Moscow \nand the people are rioting. How is it that we \nare staying on?" \n\n"On the contrary, things seem satisfactory, \nma cousine," said Pierre in the bantering tone \nhe habitually adopted toward her, always feel- \ning uncomfortable in the role of her benefac- \ntor. \n\n"Satisfactory, indeed! Very satisfactory! Bar- \nbara Ivanovna told me today how our troops \nare distinguishing themselves. It certainly does \nthem credit! And the people too are quite mu- \ntinousthey no longer obey, even my maid has \ntaken to being rude. At this rate they will soon \nbegin beating us. One can't walk in the streets. \nBut, above all, the French will be here any \nday now, so what are we waiting for? I ask just \none thing of you, cousin," she went on, "ar- \nrange for me to be taken to Petersburg. What- \never I may be, I can't live under Bonaparte's \nrule." \n\n"Oh, come, ma cousine! Where do you get \nyour information from? On the contrary . . ." \n\n"I won't submit to your Napoleon! Others \nmay if they please. ... If you don't want to do \nthis . . ." \n\n"But I will, I'll give the order at once." \n\nThe princess was apparently vexed at not \nhaving anyone to be angry with. Muttering to \nherself, she sat down on a chair. \n\n"But you have been misinformed," said \nPierre. "Everything is quiet in the city and \nthere is not the slightest danger. See! I've just \nbeen reading . . ." He showed her the broad- \nsheet. "Count Rostopchfn writes that he will \nstake his life on it that the enemy will not en- \nter Moscow." \n\n"Oh, that count of yours!" said the princess \nmalevolently. "He is a hypocrite, a rascal who \nhas himself roused the people to riot. Didn't he \nwrite in those idiotic broadsheets that anyone, \n'whoever it might be, should be dragged to the \nlockup by his hair? (How silly!) 'And honor \nand glory to whoever captures him/ he says. \n\n\n\nBOOK TEN \n\n\n\nThis is what his cajolery has brought us to! \nBarbara Ivdnovna told me the mob nearly \nkilled her because she said something in \nFrench." \n\n"Oh, but it's so ... You take everything so to \nheart," said Pierre, and began laying out his \ncards for patience. \n\nAlthough that patience did come out, Pierre \ndid not join the army, but remained in desert- \ned Moscow ever in the same state of agitation, \nirresolution, and alarm, yet at the same time \njoyfully expecting something terrible. \n\nNext day toward evening the princess set off, \nand Pierre's head steward came to inform him \nthat the money needed for the equipment of \nhis regiment could not be found without selling \none of the estates. In general the head steward \nmade out to Pierre that his project of raising a \nregiment would ruin him. Pierre listened to \nhim, scarcely able to repress a smile. \n\n"Well then, sell it," said he. "What's to be \ndone? I can't draw back now!" \n\nThe worse everything became, especially his \nown affairs, the better was Pierre pleased and \nthe more evident was it that the catastrophe he \nexpected was approaching. Hardly anyone he \nknew was left in town. Julie had gone, and so \nhad Princess Mary. Of his intimate friends on- \nly the Rost6vs remained, but he did not go to \nsee them. \n\nTo distract his thoughts he drove that day \nto the village of Voronts6vo to see the great \nballoon Leppich was constructing to destroy \nthe foe, and a trial balloon that was to go up \nnext day. The balloon was not yet ready, but \nPierre learned that it was being constructed by \nthe Emperor's desire. The Emperor had writ- \nten to Count Rostopchin as follows: \n\nAs soon as Leppich is ready, get together a crew \nof reliable and intelligent men for his car and send \na courier to General Kutuzov to let him know. I \nhave informed him of the matter. \n\nPlease impress upon Leppich to be very careful \nwhere he descends for the first time, that he may \nnot make a mistake and fall into the enemy's \nhands. It is essential for him to combine his move- \nments with those of the commander in chief. \n\nOn his way home from Voronts6vo, as he was \npassing the Bol6tnoe Place Pierre, seeing a \nlarge crowd round the L6bnoe Place, stopped \nand got out of his trap. A French cook accused \nof being a spy was being flogged. The flogging \nwas only just over, and the executioner was re- \nleasing from the flogging bench a stout man \nwith red whiskers, in blue stockings and a \ngreen jacket, who was moaning piteously. An- \n\n\n\nother criminal, thin and pale, stood near. Judg- \ning by their faces they were both Frenchmen. \nWith a frightened and suffering look resem- \nbling that on the thin Frenchman's face, Pierre \npushed his way in through the crowd. \n\n"What is it? Who is it? What is it for?" he \nkept asking. \n\nBut the attention of the crowd officials, \nburghers, shopkeepers, peasants, and women \nin cloaks and in pelisses was so eagerly cen- \ntered on what was passing in L6bnoe Place that \nno one answered him. The stout man rose, \nfrowned, shrugged his shoulders, and evidently \ntrying to appear firm began to pull on his jack- \net without looking about him, but suddenly his \nlips trembled and he began to cry, in the way \nfull-blooded grown-up men cry, though angry \nwith himself for doing so. In the crowd peo- \nple began talking loudly, to stifle their feelings \nof pity as it seemed to Pierre. \n\n"He's cook to some prince." \n\n"Eh, mounseer, Russian sauce seems to be \nsour to a Frenchman . . . sets his teeth on edgel" \nsaid a wrinkled clerk who was standing behind \nPierre, when the Frenchman began to cry. \n\nThe clerk glanced round, evidently hoping \nthat his joke would be appreciated. Some peo- \nple began to laugh, others continued to watch \nin dismay the executioner who was undressing \nthe other man. \n\nPierre choked, his face puckered, and he \nturned hastily away, went back to his trap mut- \ntering something to himself as he went, and \ntook his seat. As they drove along he shuddered \nand exclaimed several times so audibly that the \ncoachman asked him: \n\n"What is your pleasure?" \n\n"Where are you going?" shouted Pierre to \nthe man, who was driving to Lubyanka Street. \n\n"To the Governor's, as you ordered," an- \nswered the coachman. \n\n"Fool! Idiot!" shouted Pierre, abusing his \ncoachman a thing he rarely did. "Home, I told \nyou! And drive faster, blockhead!" "I must get \naway this very day," he murmured to himself. \n\nAt the sight of the tortured Frenchman and \nthe crowd surrounding the L6bnoe Place, \nPierre had so definitely made up his mind that \nhe could no longer remain in Moscow and \nwould leave for the army that very day that it \nseemed to him that either he had told the \ncoachman this or that the man ought to have \nknown it for himself. \n\nOn reaching .home Pierre gave orders to \nEvstfey his head coachman who knew every- \nthing, could do anything, and was known to all \n\n\n\n430 \n\nMoscow that he would leave that night for \nthe army at Mozhdysk, and that his saddle \nhorses should be sent there. This could not all \nbe arranged that day, so on Evstdfey's represen- \ntation Pierre had to put off his departure till \nnext day to allow time for the relay horses to \nbe sent on in advance. \n\nOn the twenty-fourth the weather cleared \nup after a spell of rain, and after dinner Pierre \nleft Moscow. When changing horses that night \nin Perkhushkovo, he learned that there had \nbeen a great battle that evening. (This was the \nbattle of Shevdrdino.) He was told that there \nin Perkhushkovo the earth trembled from the \nfiring, but nobody could answer his questions \nas to who had won. At dawn next day Pierre \nwas approaching Mozhdysk. \n\nEvery house in Mozhdysk had soldiers quar- \ntered in it, and at the hostel where Pierre was \nmet by his groom and coachman there was no \nroom to be had. It was full of officers. \n\nEverywhere in Mozhaysk and beyond it, \ntroops were stationed or on the march. Cos- \nsacks, foot and horse soldiers, wagons, caissons, \nand cannon were everywhere. Pierre pushed \nforward as fast as he could, and the further he \nleft Moscow behind and the deeper he plunged \ninto that sea of troops the more was he over- \ncome by restless agitation and a new and joy- \nful feeling he had not experienced before. It \nwas a feeling akin to what he had felr at the \nSlob6da Palace during the Emperor's visita \nsense of the necessity of undertaking some- \nthing and sacrificing something. lie now ex- \nperienced a glad consciousness that everything \nthat constitutes men's happiness the comforts \nof life, wealth, even life itself is rubbish it is \npleasant to throw away, compared with some- \nthing . . . With what? Pierre could not say, and \nhe did not try to determine for whom and for \nwhat he felt such particular delight in sacrific- \ning everything. He was not occupied with the \nquestion of what to sacrifice for; the fact of \nsacrificing in itself afforded him a new and joy- \nous sensation. \n\nCHAPTER XIX \n\nON THE TWENTY-FOURTH OF AUGUST the battle \nof the Shevdrdino Redoubt was fought, on the \ntwenty-fifth not a shot was fired by either side, \nand on the twenty-sixth the battle of Borodin6 \nitself took place. \n\nWhy and how were the battles of Shevdrdino \nand Borodin6 given and accepted? Why was \nthe battle of Borodin6 fought? There was not \nthe least sense in it for either the French or \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\nthe Russians. Its immediate result for the Rus- \nsians was, and wa^ bound to be, that we were \nbrought nearer to the destruction of Moscow \nwhich we feared more than anything in the \nworld; and for the French its immediate re- \nsult was that they were brought nearer to the \ndestruction of their whole army which they \nfeared more than anything in the world. What \nthe result must be was quite obvious, and yet \nNapoleon offered and Kutuzov accepted that \nbattle. \n\nIf the commanders had been guided by rea- \nson, it would seem that it must have been ob- \nvious to Napoleon that by advancing thirteen \nhundred miles and giving battle with a prob- \nability of losing a quarter of his army, he was \nadvancing to certain destruction, and it must \nhave been equally clear to Kutiizov that by ac- \ncepting battle and risking the loss of a quarter \nof his army he would certainly lose Moscow. \nFor Kutuzov this was mathematically clear, as \nit is that if when playing draughts I have one \nman less and go on exchanging, I shall certainly \nlose, and therefore should not exchange. When \nmy opponent has sixteen men and I have four- \nteen, I am only one eighth weaker than he, but \nwhen I have exchanged thirteen more men he \nwill be three times as strong as I am. \n\nBefore the battle of Borodin6 our strength \nin proportion to the French was about as five \nto six, but after that battle it was little more \nthan one to two: previously we had a hundred \nthousand against a hundred and twenty thou- \nsand; afterwards little more than fifty thousand \nagainst a hundred thousand. Yet the shrewd and \nexperienced Kutuzov accepted the battle, \nwhile Napoleon, who was said to be a com- \nmander of genius, gave it, losing a quarter of \nhis army and lengthening his lines of commu- \nnication still more. If it is said that he expected \nto end the campaign by occupying Moscow as \nhe had ended a previous campaign by occupy- \ning Vienna, there is much evidence to the con- \ntrary. Napoleon's historians themselves tell us \nthat from Smolensk onwards he wished to stop, \nknew the danger of his extended position, \nand knew that the occupation of Moscow would \nnot be the end of the campaign, for he had seen \nat Smolensk the state in which Russian towns \nwere left to him, and had not received a single \nreply to his repeated announcements of his \nwish to negotiate. \n\nIn giving and accepting battle at Borodin6, \nKutuzov acted involuntarily and irrationally. \nBut later on, to fit what had occurred, the his- \ntorians provided cunningly devised evidence \n\n\n\nof the foresight and genius of the generals, who \nof all the blind tools of history were the most \nenslaved and involuntary. \n\nThe ancients have left us model heroic po- \nems in which the heroes furnish the whole in- \nterest of the story, and we are still unable to \naccustom ourselves to the fact that for our ep- \noch histories of that kind are meaningless. \n\nOn the other question, how the battle of \nBorodin6 and the preceding battle of Shevdr- \ndino were fought, there also exists a definite \nand well-known, but quite false, conception. \nAll the historians describe the affair as follows: \n\nThe Russian army, they say, in its retreat \nfrom Smolensk sought out for itself the best \nposition for a general engagement and found \nsuch a position at Borodind. \n\nThe Russians, they say, fortified this posi- \ntion in advance on the left of the highroad \n(from Moscow to Smolensk) and almost at a \nright angle to it, from Borodind to Utitsa, at \nthe very place where the battle was fought. \n\nIn front of this position, they say, a fortified \noutpost was set up on the Shevdrdino mound \nto observe the enemy. On the twenty-fourth, \nwe are told, Napoleon attacked this advanced \npost and took it, and, on the twenty-sixth, at- \ntacked the whole Russian army, which was in \nposition on the field of Borodino. \n\nSo the histories say, and it is all quite wrong, \nas anyone who cares to look into the matter \ncan easily convince himself. \n\nThe Russians did not seek out the best po- \nsition but, on the contrary, during the retreat \npassed many positions better than Borodin6. \nThey did not stop at any one of these positions \nbecause Kutuzov did not wish to occupy a po- \nsition he had not himself chosen, because the \npopular demand for a battle had not yet ex- \npressed itself strongly enough, and because \nMilorddovich had not yet arrived with the mi- \nlitia, and for many other reasons. The fact is \nthat other positions they had passed were \nstronger, and that the position at Borodin6 \n(the one where the battle was fought), far from \nbeing strong, was no more a position than any \nother spot one might find in the Russian Em- \npire by sticking a pin into the map at hazard. \n\nNot only did the Russians not fortify the po- \nsition on the field of Borodin6 to the left of, \nand at a right angle to, the highroad (that is, \nthe position on which the battle took place), \nbut never till the twenty-fifth of August, 1812, \ndid they think that a battle might be fought \nthere. This was shown first by the fact that \nthere were no entrenchments there by the \n\n\n\nBOOK TEN 431 \n\ntwenty-fifth, and that those begun on the \n\n\n\ntwenty-fifth and twenty-sixth were not complet- \ned, and secondly, by the position of the Shevar- \ndino Redoubt. That redoubt was quite sense- \nless in front of the position where the battle \nwas accepted. Why was it more strongly forti- \nfied than any other post? And why were all ef- \nforts exhausted and six thousand men sacri- \nficed to defend it till late at night on the \ntwenty-fourth? A Cossack patrol would have \nsufficed to observe the enemy. Thirdly, as proof \nthat the position on which the battle was \nfought had not been foreseen and that the \nShevdrdino Redoubt was not an advanced post \nof that position, we have the fact that up to the \ntwenty-fifth, Barclay de Tolly and Bagrati6n \nwere convinced that the Shevdrdino Redoubt \nwas the left flank of the position, and that Ku- \ntuzov himself in his report, written in hot haste \nafter the battle, speaks of the Shevdrdino Re- \ndoubt as the left flank of the position. It was \nmuch later, when reports on the battle of Bor- \nodin6 were written at leisure, that the incorrect \nand extraordinary statement was invented \n(probably to justify the mistakes of a com- \nmander in chief who had to be represented as \ninfallible) that the Shevdrdino Redoubt was an \nadvanced post whereas in reality it was sim- \nply a fortified point on the left flank and that \nthe battle of Borodino was fought by us on an \nentrenched position previously selected, where- \nas it was fought on a quite unexpected spot \nwhich was almost unentrenched. \n\nThe case was evidently this: a position was \nselected along the river Kolochd which crosses \nthe highroad not at a right angle but at an \nacute angle so that the left flank was at She- \nvdrdino, the right flank near the village of N6- \nvoe, and the center at Boroclin6 at the conflu- \nence of the rivers Kolochd and Voyna. \n\nTo anyone who looks at the field of Boro- \ndino without thinking of how the battle was \nactually fought, this position, protected by the \nriver Kolochd, presents itself as obvious for an \narmy whose object was to prevent an enemy \nfrom advancing along the Smolensk road to \nMoscow. \n\nNapoleon, riding to Value"vo on the twenty- \nfourth, did not see (as the history books say he \ndid) the position of the Russians from Utftsa \nto Borodin6 (he could not have seen that po- \nsition because it did not exist), nor did he see \nan advanced post of the Russian army, but \nwhile pursuing the Russian rearguard he came \nupon the left flank of the Russian position at \nthe Shevdrdino Redoubt and unexpectedly \n\n\n\n432 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nfor the Russians moved his army across the Ko- \nlochd. And the Russians, not having time to \nbegin a general engagement, withdrew their \nleft wing from the position they had intended \nto occupy and took up a new position which \nhad not been foreseen andwas not fortified. By \ncrossing to the other side of the Kolochd to the \nleft of the highroad, Napoleon shifted the \nwhole forthcoming battle from right to left \n(looking from the Russian side) and trans- \nferred it to the plain between Utitsa, Seme- \nnovsk, and Borodino a plain no more advan- \ntageous as a position than any other plain in \nRussia and there the whole battle of the \ntwenty-sixth of August took place. [See the \nrough outline of the plan of the intended bat- \ntle and of the battle that actually took place.] \n\nHad Napoleon not ridden out on the eve- \nning of the twenty-fourth to the Kolochd, and \nhad he not then ordered an immediate attack \non the redoubt but had begun the attack next \nmorning, no one would have doubted that the \nShevdrdino Redoubt was the left flank of our \nposition, and the battlewould have taken place \nwhere we expected it. In that case we should \nprobably have defended the Shevdrdino Re- \ndoubtour left flank still more obstinately. \nWe should have attacked Napoleon in the \ncenter or on the right, and the engagement \nwould have taken place on the twenty- filth, in \nthe position we intended and had fortified. But \nas the attack on our left flank took place in the \nevening after the retreat of our rearguard (that \nis, immediately after the fight at Gridneva), \nand as the Russian commanders did not wish, \nor were not in time, to begin a general engage- \nment then on theeveningof the twenty-fourth, \nthe first and chief action of the battle of Boro- \ndino was already lost on the twenty-fourth, \nand obviously led to the loss of the one fought \non the twenty-sixth. \n\nAfter the loss of the Shevdrdino Redoubt, we \nfound ourselves on the morning of the twenty- \nfifth without a position for our left flank, and \nwere forced to bend it back and hastily en- \ntrench it where it chanced to be. \n\nNotonlywas the Russian army on the twenty- \nsixth defended by weak, unfinished entrench- \nments, but the disadvantage of that position \nwas increased by the fact that the Russian com- \nmandersnot having fully realized what had \nhappened, namely the loss of our position on \nthe left flank and the shifting of the whole field \nof the forthcoming battle from right to left- \nmaintained their extended position from the \nvillage of N6voe to Utftsa, and consequently \n\n\n\nhad to move their forces from right to left dur- \ning the battle. So it happened that throughout \nthe whole battle the Russians opposed the en- \ntire French army launched against our left \nflank with but half as many men. (Poniatow- \nski's action against Utftsa, and Uvdrov's on the \nright flank against the French, were actions \ndistinct from the main course of the battle.) \nSo the battle of Borodin6 did not take place at \nall as (in an effort to conceal our commanders' \nmistakes even at the cost of diminishing the \nglory due to the Russian army and people) it \nhas been described. The battle of BorodimS \nwas not fought on a chosen and entrenched \nposition with forces only slightly weaker than \nthose of the enemy, but, as a result of the \nloss of the Shevdrdino Redoubt, the Russians \nfought the battle of Borodin6 on an open and \nalmost unentrenched position, with forces on- \nly half as numerous as the French; that is to \nsay, under conditions in which it was not mere- \nly unthinkable to fight for ten hours and se- \ncure an indecisive result, but unthinkable to \nkeep an army even from complete disintegra- \ntion and flight. \n\nCHAPTER XX \n\nON THE MORNING of the twenty-fifth Pierre was \nleaving Mozhdysk. At the descent of the high \nsteep hill, down which a winding road led out \nof the town past the cathedral on the right, \nwhere a service was being held and the bells \nwere ringing, Pierre got out of his vehicle and \nproceeded on foot. Behind him a cavalry regi- \nment was coming down the hill preceded by its \nsingers. Coming up toward him was a train of \ncarts carrying men who had been wounded in \nthe engagement the day before. The peasant \ndrivers, shouting and lashing their horses, kept \ncrossing from side to side. The carts, in each of \nwhich three or four wounded soldiers were ly- \ning or sitting, jolted over the stones that had \nbeen thrown on the steep incline to make it \nsomething like a road. The wounded, band- \naged with rags, with pale cheeks, compressed \nlips, and knitted brows, held on to the sides of \nthe carts as they were jolted against one anoth- \ner. Almost all of them stared with naive, child- \nlike curiosity at Pierre's white hat and green \nswallow-tail coat. \n\nPierre's coachman shouted angrily at the \nconvoy of wounded to keep to one side of the \nroad. The cavalry regiment, as it descended the \nhill with its singers, surrounded Pierre's car- \nriage and blocked the road. Pierre stopped, \nbeing pressed against the side of the cutting in \n\n\n\nBOOK TEN \n\n\n\n433 \n\n\n\nwhich the road ran. The sunshine from behind \nthe hill did not penetrate into the cutting and \nthere it was cold and damp, but above Pierre's \nhead was the bright August sunshine and the \nbells sounded merrily. One of the carts with \nwounded stopped by the side of the road close \nto Pierre. The driver in his bast shoes ran pant- \ning up to it, placed a stone under one of its \ntireless hind wheels, and began arranging the \nbreech-band on his little horse. \n\nOne of the wounded, an old soldier with a \nbandaged arm who was following the cart on \nfoot, caught hold of it with his sound hand and \nturned to look at Pierre. \n\n"I say, fellow countryman I Will they set us \ndown here or take us on to Moscow?" h asked. \n\nPierre was so deep in thought that he did not \nhear the question. He was looking now at the \ncavalry regiment that had met the convoy of \nwounded, now at the cart by which he was \nstanding, in which two wounded men were \nsitting and one was lying. One of those sitting \nup in the cart had probably been wounded in \nthe cheek. His whole head was wrapped in \nrags and one check was swollen to the size of a \nbaby's head. His nose and mouth were twisted \nto one side. This soldier was looking at the \ncathedral and crossing himself. Another, a \nyoung lad, a fair-haired recruit as white as \nthough there was no blood in his thin face, \nlooked at Pierre kindly, with a fixed smile. \nThe third lay prone so that his face was not \nvisible. The cavalry singers were passing close \nby: \n\nAh lost, quite lost . . . is my head so keen, \nLiving in a foreign land . . . \n\nthey sang their soldiers' dance song. \n\nAs if responding to them but with a different \nsort of merriment, the metallic sound of the \nbells reverberated high above and the hot rays \nof the sun bathed the top of the opposite slope \nwith yet another sort of merriment. But be- \nneath the slope, by the cart with the wounded \nnear the panting little nag where Pierre stood, \nit was damp, somber, and sad. \n\nThe soldier with the swollen cheek looked \nangrily at the cavalry singers. \n\n"Oh, the coxcombs 1" he muttered reproach- \nfully. \n\n"It's not the soldiers only, but I've seen peas- \nants today, too. . . . The peasants even they \nhave to go," said the soldier behind the cart, \naddressing Pierre with a sad smile. "No dis- \ntinctions made nowadays. . . . They want the \nwhole nation to fall on them in a word, it's \nMoscow! They want to make an end of it." \n\n\n\nIn spite of the obscurity of the soldier's \nwords Pierre understood what he wanted to say \nand nodded approval. \n\nThe road was clear again; Pierre descended \nthe hill and drove on. \n\nHe kept looking to either side of the road \nfor familiar faces, but only saw everywhere the \nunfamiliar faces of various military men of \ndifferent branches of the service, who all \nlooked with astonishment at his white hat and \ngreen tail coat. \n\nHaving gone nearly three miles he at last \nmet an acquaintance and eagerly addressed \nhim. This was one of the head army doctors. \nHe was driving toward Pierre in a covered gig, \nsitting beside a young surgeon, and on recog- \nnizing Pierre he told the Cossack who occupied \nthe driver's seat to pull up. \n\n"Count! Your excellency, how come you to \nbe here?" asked the doctor. \n\n"Well, you know, I wanted to see . . ." \n\n"Yes, yes, there will be something to see " \n\nPierre got out and talked to the doctor, ex- \nplaining his intention of taking part in a bat- \ntle. \n\nThe doctor advised him to apply direct to \nKutiizov. \n\n"Why should you be God knows where out \nof sight, during the battle?" he said, exchang- \ning glances with his young companion. "Any- \nhow his Serene Highness knows you and will \nreceive you graciously. That's what you must \ndo." \n\nThe doctor seemed tired and in a hurry. \n\n"You think so? ... Ah, I also wanted to ask \nyou where our position is exactly?" said Pierre. \n\n"The position?" repeated the doctor. "Well, \nthat's not my line. Drive past Tatdrinova, a \nlot of digging is going on there. Go up the hill- \nock and you'll see." \n\n"Can one see from there? ... If you would \n\nBut the doctor interrupted him and moved \ntoward his gig. \n\n"I would go with you but on my honor I'm \nup to here" and he pointed to his throat. "I'm \ngalloping to the commander of the corps. How \ndo matters stand? . . . You know, Count, there'll \nbe a battle tomorrow. Out of an army of a hun- \ndred thousand we must expect at least twenty \nthousand wounded, and we haven't stretchers, \nor bunks, or dressers, or doctors enough for six \nthousand. We have ten thousand carts, but we \nneed other things as well we must manage as \nbest we can!" \n\nThe strange thought that of the thousands \n\n\n\n434 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nof men, young and old, who had stared with \nmerry surprise at his hat (perhaps the very \nmen he had noticed), twenty thousand were \ninevitably doomed to wounds and death amazed \nPierre. \n\n"They may die tomorrow; why are they \nthinking of anything but death?" And by some \nlatent sequence of thought the descent of the \nMozhdysk hill, the carts with the wounded, the \nringing bells, the slanting rays of the sun, and \nthe songs of the cavalrymen vividly recurred to \nhis mind. \n\n"The cavalry ride to battle and meet the \nwounded and do not for a moment think of \nwhat awaits them, but pass by, winking at the \nwounded. Yet from among these men twenty \nthousand are doomed to die, and they wonder \nat my hat! Strange!" thought Pierre, continu- \ning his way to Tatarinova. \n\nIn front of a landowner's house to the left of \nthe road stood carriages, wagons, and crowds \nof orderlies and sentinels. The commander in \nchief was putting up there, but just when \nPierre arrived he was not in and hardly any of \nthe staff were therethey had gone to the \nchurch service. Pierre drove on toward G6rki. \n\nWhen he had ascended the hill and reached \nthe little village street, he saw for the first time \npeasant militiamen in their white shirts and \nwith crosses on their caps, who, talking and \nlaughing loudly, animated and perspiring, \nwere at work on a huge knoll overgrown with \ngrass to the right of the road. \n\nSome of them were digging, others were \nwheeling barrowloads of earth along planks, \nwhile others stood about doing nothing. \n\nTwo officers were standing on the knoll, di- \nrecting the men. On seeing these peasants, who \nwere evidently still amused by the novelty of \ntheir position as soldiers, Pierre once more \nthought of the wounded men at Mozhdysk and \nunderstood what the soldier had meant when \nhe said: "They want the whole nation to fall \non them." The sight of these bearded peasants \nat work on the battlefield, with their queer, \nclumsy boots and perspiring necks, and their \nshirts opening from the left toward the middle, \nunfastened, exposing their sunburned collar- \nbones, impressed Pierre more strongly with the \nsolemnity and importance of the moment than \nanything he had yet seen or heard. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI \n\nPIERRE STEPPED OUT of his carriage and, pass- \ning the toiling militiamen, ascended the \nknoll from which, according to the doctor, \n\n\n\nthe battlefield could be seen. \n\nIt was about eleven o'clock. The sun shone \nsomewhat to the left and behind him and \nbrightly lit up the enormous panorama which, \nrising like an amphitheater, extended before \nhim in the clear rarefied atmosphere. \n\nFrom above on the left, bisecting that am- \nphitheater, wound the Smolensk highroad, \npassing through a village with a white church \nsome five hundred paces in front of the knoll \nand below it. This was Borodin6. Below the \nvillage the road crossed the river by a bridge \nand, winding down and up, rose higher and \nhigher to the village of Valiievo visible about \nfour miles away, where Napoleon was then sta- \ntioned. Beyond Valiievo the road disappeared \ninto a yellowing forest on the horizon. Far in \nthe distance in that birch and fir forest to the \nright of the road, the cross and belfry of the \nKolochd Monastery gleamed in the sun. Here \nand there over the whole of that blue expanse, \nto right and left of the forest and the road, \nsmoking campfires could be seen and indefinite \nmasses of troops ours and the enemy's. The \nground to the right along the course of the \nKolochd and Moskvd rivers was broken and \nhilly. Between the hollows the villages of Bez- \nziibova and Zakhdrino showed in the distance. \nOn the left the ground was more level; there \nwere fields of grain, and the smoking ruins of \nSemenovsk, which had been burned down, \ncould be seen. \n\nAll that Pierre saw was so indefinite that \nneither the left nor the right side of the field \nfully satisfied his expectations. Nowhere could \nhe see the battlefield he had expected to find, \nbut only fields, meadows, troops, woods, the \nsmoke of campfires, villages, mounds, and \nstreams; and try as he would he could descry \nno military "position" in this place which \nteemed with life, nor could he even distinguish \nour troops from the enemy's. \n\n"I must ask someone who knows," bethought, \nand addressed an officer who was looking with \ncuriosity at his huge unmilitary figure. \n\n"May I ask you," said Pierre, "what village \nthat is in front?" \n\n"Biirdino, isn't it?" said the officer, turning \nto his companion. \n\n"Borodin6," the other corrected him. \n\nThe officer, evidently glad of an opportu- \nnity for a talk, moved up to Pierre. \n\n"Are those our men there?" Pierre inquired. \n\n"Yes, and there, further on, are the French," \nsaid the officer. "There they are, there . . . you \ncan see them." \n\n\n\nBOOK TEN \n\n\n\n435 \n\n\n\n"Where? Where?" asked Pierre. \n\n"One can see them with the naked eye. . . . \nWhy, therel" \n\nThe officer pointed with his hand to the \nsmoke visible on the left beyond the river, and \nthe same stern and serious expression that \nPierre had noticed on many of the faces he had \nmet came into his face. \n\n"Ah, so those are the French! And over there? \n. . ." Pierre pointed to a knoll on the left, near \nwhich some troops could be seen. \n\n"Those are ours." \n\n"Ah, ours I And there? . . ." Pierre pointed to \nanother knoll in the distance with a big tree on \nit, near a village that lay in a hollow where also \nsome campfires were smoking and something \nblack was visible. \n\n"That's his again," said the officer. (It was \nthe Shevdrdino Redoubt.) "It was ours yester- \nday, but now it is his" \n\n"Then how about our position?" \n\n"Our position?" replied the officer with a \nsmile of satisfaction. "I can tell you quite clear- \nly, because I constructed nearly all our en- \ntrenchments. There, you see? There's our cen- \nter, at Borodin6, just there," and he pointed to \nthe village in front of them with the white \nchurch. "That's where one crosses the Kolocha. \nYou see down there where the rows of hay are \nlying in the hollow, there's the bridge. That's \nour center. Our right flank is over there" he \npointed sharply to the right, far away in the \nbroken ground "That's where the Moskva \nRiver is, and we have thrown up three redoubts \nthere, very strong ones. The left flank . . ." \nhere the officer paused. "Well, you see, that's \ndifficult to explain. . . . Yesterday our left flank \nwas there at Shevdrdino, you see, where the \noak is, but now we have withdrawn our left \nwing now it is over there, do you see that vil- \nlage and the smoke? That's Semenovsk, yes, \nthere," he pointed to Ravski's knoll. "But the \nbattle will hardly be there. His having moved \nhis troops there is only a ruse; he will probably \npass round to the right of the Moskva. But \nwherever it may be, many a man will be miss- \ning tomorrow 1" he remarked. \n\nAn elderly sergeant who had approached the \nofficer while he was giving these explanations \nhad waited in silence for him to finish speak- \ning, but at this point, evidently not liking the \nofficer's remark, interrupted him. \n\n"Gabions must be sent for," said he stern- \n\niy- \n\nThe officer appeared abashed, as though he \nunderstood that one might think of how many \n\n\n\nmen would be missing tomorrow but ought not \nto speak of it. \n\n"Well, send number three company again," \nthe officer replied hurriedly. \n\n"And you, are you one of the doctors?" \n\n"No, I've come on my own," answered Pierre, \nand he went down the hill again, passing the \nmilitiamen. \n\n"Oh, those damned fellows!" muttered the \nofficer who followed him, holding his nose as \nhe ran past the men at work. \n\n"There they are . . . bringing her, coming . . . \nThere they are . . . They'll be here in a minute \n. . ." voices were suddenly heard saying; and \nofficers, soldiers, and militiamen began run- \nning forward along the road. \n\nA church procession was coming up the hill \nfrom Borodim'). First along the dusty road came \nthe infantry in ranks, bareheaded and with \narms reversed. From behind them came the \nsound of church singing. \n\nSoldiers and militiamen ran bareheaded past \nPierre toward the procession. \n\n"They are bringing her, our Protectress! . . . \nThe Iberian Mother of God!" someone cried. \n\n"The Smolensk Mother of God," another \ncorrected him. \n\nThe militiamen, both those who had been \nin the village and those who had been at work \non the battery, threw down their spades and \nran to meet the church procession. Following \nthe battalion that marched along the dusty \nroad came priests in their vestments one little \nold man in a hood with attendants and singers. \nBehind them soldiers and officers bore a large, \ndark-faced icon with an embossed metal cover. \nThis was the icon that had been brought from \nSmolensk and had since accompanied the army. \nBehind, before, and on both sides, crowds of \nmilitiamen with bared heads walked, ran, and \nbowed to the ground. \n\nAt the summit of the hill they stopped with \nthe icon; the men who had been holding it up \nby the linen bands attached to it were relieved \nby others, the chanters relit their censers, and \nservice began. The hot rays of the sun beat \ndown vertically and a fresh soft wind played \nwith the hair of the bared heads and with the \nribbons decorating the icon. The singing did \nnot sound loud under the open sky. An im- \nmense crowd of bareheaded officers, soldiers, \nand militiamen surrounded the icon. Behind \nthe priest and a chanter stood the notabilities \non a spot reserved for them. A bald general with \na St. George's Cross on his neck stood just be- \nhind the priest's back, and without crossing \n\n\n\n436 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nhimself (he was evidently a German) patiently \nawaited the end of the service, which he con- \nsidered it necessary to hear to the end, prob- \nably to arouse the patriotism of the Russian \npeople. Another general stood in a martial pose, \ncrossing himself by shaking his hand in front \nof his chest while looking about him. Standing \namong the crowd of peasants, Pierre recognized \nseveral acquaintances among these notables, \nbut did not look at them his whole attention \nwas absorbed in watching the serious expression \non the faces of the crowd of soldiers and militia- \nmen who were all gazing eagerly at the icon. \nAs soon as the tired chanters, who were sing- \ning the service for the twentieth time that day, \nbegan lazily and mechanically to sing: "Save \nfrom calamity Thy servants, O Motherof God," \nand the priest and deacon chimed in: "For to \nThee under God we all flee as to an inviolable \nbulwark and protection," there again kindled \nin all those faces the same expression of con- \nsciousness of the solemnity of the impending \nmoment that Pierre had seen on the faces at \nthe foot of the hill at MozMysk and momen- \ntarily on many and many faces he had met that \nmorning; and heads were bowed more fre- \nquently and hair tossed back, and sighs and the \nsound men made as they crossed themselves \nwere heard. \n\nThe crowd round the icon suddenly parted \nand pressed against Pierre. Someone, a very \nimportant personage judging by the haste with \nwhich way was made for him, was approaching \nthe icon. \n\nIt was Kutuzov, who had been riding round \nthe position and on his way back to Tatdrino- \nva had stopped where the service was being \nheld. Pierre recognized him at once by his pe- \nculiar figure, which distinguished him from ev- \nerybody else. \n\nWith a longovercoat on his exceedingly stout, \nround-shouldered body, with uncovered white \nhead and puffy face showing the white ball of \nthe eye he had lost, Kutuzov walked with \nplunging, swaying gait into the crowd and \nstopped behind the priest. He crossed himself \nwith an accustomed movement, bent till he \ntouched the ground with his hand, and bowed \nhis white head with a deep sigh. Behind Kutu- \nzov was Bennigsen and the suite. Despite the \npresence of the commander in chief, who at- \ntracted the attention of all the superior officers, \nthe militiamen and soldiers continued their \nprayers without looking at him. \n\nWhen the service was over, Kutuzov stepped \nup to the icon, sank heavily to his knees, bowed \n\n\n\nto the ground, and for a long time tried vainly \nto rise, but could not do so on account of his \nweakness and weight. His white head twitched \nwith the effort. At last he rose, kissed the icon \nas a child does with naively pouting lips, and \nagain bowed till he touched the ground with \nhis hand. The other generals followed his ex- \nample, then the officers, and after them with \nexcited faces, pressing on one another, crowd- \ning, panting, and pushing, scrambled the sol- \ndiers and militiamen. \n\nCHAPTER XXII \n\nSTAGGERING amid the crush, Pierre looked about \nhim. \n\n"Count Peter Kirilovich! How did you get \nhere?" said a voice. \n\nPierre looked round. Boris Drubetsk6y, \nbrushing his knees with his hand (he had \nprobably soiled them when he, too, had knelt \nbefore the icon), came up to him smiling. \nBoris was elegantly dressed, with a slightly \nmartial touch appropriate to a campaign. He \nwore a long coat and like Kutuzov had a whip \nslung across his shoulder. \n\nMeanwhile Kutuzov had reached the village \nand seated himself in the shade of the nearest \nhouse, on a bench which one Cossack had run \nto fetch and another had hastily covered with a \nrug. An immense and brilliant suite surround- \ned him. \n\nThe icon was carried further, accompanied \nby the throng. Pierre stopped some thirty paces \nfrom Kutuzov, talking to Boris. \n\nHe explained his wish to be present at the \nbattle and to see the position. \n\n"This is what you must do," said Boris. "I \nwill do the honors of the camp to you. You will \nsee everything best from where Count Ben- \nnigsen will be. I am in attendance on him, you \nknow; I'll mention it to him. But if you want \nto ride round the position, come along with us. \nWe are just going to the left flank. Then when \nwe get back, do spend the night with me and \nwe'll arrange a game of cards. Of course you \nknow Dmitri Serge'evich? Those are his quar- \nters," and he pointed to the third house in the \nvillage of G6rki. \n\n"But I should like to see the right flank. \nThey say it's very strong," said Pierre. "I should \nlike to start from the Moskva River and ride \nround the whole position." \n\n"Well, you can do that later, but the chief \nthing is the left flank." \n\n"Yes, yes. But where is Prince Bolk6nski's \nregiment? Can you point it out to me?" \n\n\n\nBOOK TEN \n\n\n\n437 \n\n\n\n"Prince Andrew's? We shall pass it and I'll \ntake you to him." \n\n"What about the left flank?" asked Pierre. \n\n"To tell you the truth, between ourselves, \nGod only knows what state our left flank is in," \nsaid Boris confidentially lowering his voice. \n"It is not at all what Count Bennigsen intend- \ned. He meant to fortify that knoll quite differ- \nently, but . . ." Boris shrugged his shoulders, \n"his Serene Highness would not have it, or \nsomeone persuaded him. You see . . ." but \nBoris did not finish, for at that moment Kaysa- \nrov, Kutuzov's adjutant, came up to Pierre. \n"Ah, Kaysarov!" said Boris, addressing him \nwith an unembarrassed smile, "I was just try- \ning to explain our position to the count. It is \namazing how his Serene Highness could so fore- \nsee the intentions of the French!" \n\n"You mean the left flank?" asked Kaysarov. \n\n"Yes, exactly; the left flank is now extremely \nstrong." \n\nThough Kutuzov had dismissed all unneces- \nsary men from the staff, Boris had contrived to \nremain at headquarters after the changes. He \nhad established himself with Count Bennigsen, \nwho, like all on whom Boris had been in at- \ntendance, considered young Prince Drubet- \nsk6y an invaluable man. \n\nIn the higher command there were two sharp- \nly defined parties: Kutuzov's party and that of \nBennigsen, the chief of staff. Boris belonged to \nthe latter and no one else, while showing ser- \nvile respect to Kutuzov, could so create an im- \npression that the old fellow was not much good \nand that Bennigsen managed everything. Now \nthe decisive moment of battle had come when \nKutuzov would be destroyed and the power \npass to Bennigsen, or even if Kutuzov won the \nbattle it would be felt that everything was \ndone by Bennigsen. In any case many great re- \nwards would have to be given for tomorrow's \naction, and new men would come to the front. \nSo Boris was full of nervous vivacity all day. \n\nAfter Kaysdrov, others whom Pierre knew \ncame up to him, and he had not time to reply \nto all the questions about Moscow that were \nshowered upon him, or to listen to all that was \ntold him. The faces all expressed animation \nand apprehension, but it seemed to Pierre that \nthe cause of the excitement shown in some of \nthese faces lay chiefly in questions of personal \nsuccess; his mind, however, was occupied by \nthe different expression he saw on other faces \nan expression that spoke not of personal \nmatters but of the universal questions of life \nand death. Kutuzov noticed Pierre's figure \n\n\n\nand the group gathered round him. \n"Call him to me," said Kutuzov. \nAn adjutant told Pierre of his Serene High- \nness' wish, and Pierre went toward Kutuzov's \nbench. But a militiaman got there before him. \nIt was D61okhov. \n\n"How did that fellow get here?" asked \nPierre. \n\n"He's a creature that wriggles in anywhere!" \nwas the answer. "He has been degraded, you \nknow. Now he wants to bob up again. He's \nbeen proposing some scheme or other and has \ncrawled into the enemy's picket line at night. \n. . . He's a brave fellow." \n\nPierre took off his hat and bowed respectful- \nly to Kutuzov. \n\n"I concluded that if I reported to your Se- \nrene Highness you might send me away or say \nthat you knew what I was reporting, but then \nI shouldn't lose anything . . ." D61okhov was \nsaying. \n\n"Yes, yes." \n\n"But if I were right, I should be rendering \na service to my Fatherland for which I am ready \nto die." \n\n"Yes, yes." \n\n"And should your Serene Highness require \na man who will not spare his skin, please think \nof me. . . . Perhaps I may prove useful to your \nSerene Highness." \n\n"Yes . . . Yes ..." Kutuzov repeated, his \nlaughing eye narrowing more and more as he \nlooked at Pierre. \n\nJust then Boris, with his courtierlike adroit- \nness, stepped up to Pierre's side near Kutuzov \nand in a most natural manner, without raising \nhis voice, said to Pierre, as though continuing \nan interrupted conversation: \n\n"The militia have put on clean white shirts \nto be ready to die. What heroism, Count!" \n\nBoris evidently said this to Pierre in order \nto be overheard by his Serene Highness. He \nknew Kutuzov's attention would be caught by \nthose words, and so it was. \n\n"What are you saying about the militia?" he \nasked Boris. \n\n"Preparing for tomorrow, your Serene High- \nnessfor death they have put on clean shirts." \n\n"Ah ... a wonderful, a matchless people!" \nsaid Kutuzov; and he closed his eyes and swayed \nhis head. "A matchless people!" he repeated \nwith a sigh. \n\n"So you want to smell gunpowder?" he said \nto Pierre. "Yes, it's a pleasant smell. I have the \nhonor to be one of your wife's adorers. Is she \nwell? My quarters are at your service." \n\n\n\n438 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nAnd as often happens with old people, Ku- \ntuzov began looking about absent-mindedly \nas if forgetting all he wanted to say or do. \n\nThen, evidently remembering what he want- \ned, he beckoned to Andrew Kaysdrov, his ad- \njutant's brother. \n\n"Those verses . . . those verses of M drin's . . . \nhow do they go, eh? Those he wrote about Ger- \ndkov: 'Lectures for the corps inditing.' . . . Re- \ncite them, recite them!" said he, evidently pre- \nparing to laugh. 1 \n\nKaysdrov recited. . . . Kutiizov smilingly nod- \nded his head to the rhythm of the verses. \n\nWhen Pierre had left Kutiizov, D61okhov \ncame up to him and took his hand. \n\n"I am very glad to meet you here, Count/' \nhe said aloud, regardless of the presence of \nstrangers and in a particularly resolute and \nsolemn tone. "On the eve of a day when God \nalone knows who of us is fated to survive, I am \nglad of this opportunity to tell you that I re- \ngret the misunderstandings that occurred be- \ntween us and should wish you not to have any \nill feeling for me. I beg you to forgive me." \n\nPierre looked at Dolokhov with a smile, not \nknowing what to say to him. With tears in his \neyes D61okhov embraced Pierre and kissed him. \n\nBoris said a few words to his general, and \nCount Bennigsen turned to Pierre and pro- \nposed that he should ride with him along the \nline. \n\n"It will interest you," said he. \n\n"Yes, very much," replied Pierre. \n\nHalf an hour later Kutiizov left for Tatdri- \nnova, and Bennigsen and his suite, with Pierre \namong them, set out on their ride along the \nline. \n\nCHAPTER XXIII \n\nFROM G6RKI, Bennigsen descended the high- \nroad to the bridge which, when they had \nlooked at it from the hill, the officer had pointed \nout as being the center of our position and \nwhere rows of fragrant new-mown hay lay by \nthe riverside. They rode across that bridge into \nthe village of Borodin6 and thence turned to \nthe left, passing an enormous number of troops \n\n1 S. N. Marin, an aide-de-camp to Alexander I, \nwas well known for his parodies and amusing \nverses. G. V. Gerdkov was a captain in the army, a \nteacher in the military school, and the author of \nnumerous patriotic works of very poor quality. \nM drin's verse about him was: \n\nYou will always go on writing \nAnd to death your readers bore: \nLectures for the corps inditing \nBe a captain evermore. \n\n-TR. \n\n\n\nand guns, and came to a high knoll where mi- \nlitiamen were digging. This was the redoubt, \nas yet unnamed, which afterwards became \nknown as the Ratfvski Redoubt, or the Knoll \nBattery, but Pierre paid no special attention \nto it. He did not know that it would become \nmore memorable to him than any other spot \non the plain of Borodin6. \n\nThey then crossed the hollow to Semenovsk, \nwhere the soldiers were dragging away the last \nlogs from the huts and barns. Then they rode \ndownhill and uphill, across a rycfield trodden \nand beaten down as if by hail, following a \ntrack freshly made by the artillery over the fur- \nrows of the plowed land, and reached some \nfleches a which were still being dug. \n\nAt the fleches Bennigsen stopped and began \nlooking at the Shevdrdino Redoubt opposite, \nwhich had been ours the day before and where \nseveral horsemen could be descried. The offi- \ncers said that either Napoleon or Murat was \nthere, and they all gazed eagerly at this little \ngroup of horsemen. Pierre also looked at them, \ntrying to guess which of the scarcely discernible \nfigures was Napoleon. At last those mounted \nmen rode away from the mound and disap- \npeared. \n\nBennigsen spoke to a general who ap- \nproached him, and began explaining the whole \nposition of our troops. Pierre listened to him, \nstraining each faculty to understand the es- \nsential points of the impending battle, but was \nmortified to feel that his mental capacity was \ninadequate for the task. He could make noth- \ning of it. Bennigsen stopped speaking and, \nnoticing that Pierre was listening, suddenly \nsaid to him: \n\n"I don't think this interests you?" \n\n"On the contrary it's very interesting!" re- \nplied Pierre not quite truthfully. \n\nFrom the fleches they rode still farther to the \nleft, along a road winding through a thick, \nlow-growing birch wood. In the middle of the \nwood a brown hare with white feet sprang out \nand, scared by the tramp of the many horses, \ngrew so confused that it leaped along the road \nin front of them for some time, arousing gen- \neral attention and laughter, and only when sev- \neral voices shouted at it did it dart to one side \nand disappear in the thicket. After going \nthrough the wood for about a mile and a half \nthey came out on a glade where troops of Tiich- \nkov's corps were stationed to defend the left \nflank. \n\nHere, at the extreme left flank, Bennigsen \n\n3 A kind of entrenchment.-L. TOLSTOY \n\n\n\ntalked a great deal and with much heat, and, \nas it seemed to Pierre, gave orders of great mil- \nitary importance. In front of Tuchkov's troops \nwas some high ground not occupied by troops. \nBennigsen loudly criticized this mistake, say- \ning that it was madness to leave a height which \ncommanded the country around unoccupied \nand to place troops below it. Some of the gen- \nerals expressed the same opinion. One in par- \nticular declared with martial heat that they \nwere put there to be slaughtered. Bennigsen on \nhis own authority ordered the troops to occu- \npy the high ground. This disposition on the \nleft flank increased Pierre's doubt of his own \ncapacity to understand military matters. Lis- \ntening to Bennigsen and the generals criticiz- \ning the position of the troops behind the hill, \nhe quite understood them and shared their \nopinion, but for that very reason he could not \nunderstand how the man who put them there \nbehind the hill could have made so gross and \npalpable a blunder. \n\nPierre did not know that these troops were \nnot, as Bennigsen supposed, put there to de- \nfend the position, but were in a concealed po- \nsition as an ambush, that they should not be \nseen and might be able to strike an approaching \nenemy unexpectedly. Bennigsen did not know \nthis and moved the troops forward according \nto his own ideas without mentioning the mat- \nter to the commander in chief. \n\nCHAPTER XXIV \n\nON THAT BRIGHT EVENING of AugUSt 25, PrinCC \n\nAndrew lay leaning on his elbow in a broken- \ndown shed in the village of Knyazk6vo at the \nfurther end of his regiment's encampment. \nThrough a gap in the broken wall he could \nsee, beside the wooden fence, a row of thirty- \nyear-old birches with their lower branches \nlopped off, a field on which shocks of oats were \nstanding, and some bushes near which rose the \nsmoke of campfires the soldiers' kitchens. \n\nNarrow and burdensome and useless to any- \none as his life now seemed to him, Prince An- \ndrew on the eve of battle felt agitated and ir- \nritable as he had done seven years before at \nAusterlitz. \n\nHe had received and given the orders for \nnext day's battle and had nothing more to do. \nBut his thoughts the simplest, clearest,- and \ntherefore most terrible thoughts would give \nhim no peace. He knew that tomorrow's battle \nwould be the most terrible of all he had taken \npart in, and for the first time in his life the pos- \nsibility of death presented itself to him not \n\n\n\nBOOK TEN 439 \n\nin relation to any worldly matter or with ref- \n\n\n\nerence to its effect on others, but simply in re- \nlation to himself, to his own soul vividly, \nplainly, terribly, and almost as a certainty. And \nfrom the height of this perception all that had \npreviously tormented and preoccupied him \nsuddenly became illumined by a cold white \nlight without shadows, without perspective, and \nwithout distinction of outline. All life appeared \nto him like magic-lantern pictures at which he \nhad long been gazing by artificial light through \na glass. Now he suddenly saw those badly daubed \npictures in clear daylight and without a glass. \n"Yes, yes! There they are, those false images \nthat agitated, enraptured, and tormented me," \nsaid he to himself, passing in review the princi- \npal pictures of the magic lantern of life and \nregarding them now in the cold white daylight \nof his clear perception of death. "There they \nare, those rudely painted figures that once \nseemed splendid and mysterious. Glory, the \ngood of society, love of a woman, the Fatherland \nitself how important these pictures appeared \nto me, with what profound meaning they \nseemed to be filled! And it is all so simple, pale, \nand crude in the cold white light of this morn- \ning which I feel is dawning for me." The three \ngreat sorrows ot his life held his attention in \nparticular: his love for a woman, his father's \ndeath, and the French invasion which had over- \nrun half Russia. "Love! . . . that little girl who \nseemed tome brimmingover with mystic forces! \nYes, indeed, 1 loved her. I made romantic plans \nof love and happiness with her! Oh, what a \nboy I was!" he said aloud bitterly. "Ah me! I \nbelieved in some ideal love which was to \nkeep her faithful to me for the whole year of \nmy absence! Like the gentle dove in the fable \nshe was to pine apart from me. . . . But it was \nmuch simpler really. ... It was all very simple \nand horrible. \n\n"When my father built Bald Hills bethought \nthe place was his: his land, his air, his peasants. \nBut Napoleon came and swept him aside, un- \nconscious of his existence, as lie might brush a \nchip from his path, and his Bald Hills and his \nwhole life fell to pieces. Princess Mary says it \nis a trial sent from above. What is the trial for, \nwhen he is not here and will never return? He \nis not here! For whom then is the trial intend- \ned? The Fatherland, the destruction of Mos- \ncow! And tomorrow I shall be killed, perhaps \nnot even by a Frenchman but by one of our \nown men, by a soldier discharging a musket \nclose to my ear as one of them did yesterday, \nand the French will come and take me by head \n\n\n\n440 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nand heels and fling me into a hole that I may \nnot stink under their noses, and new condi- \ntions of life will arise, which will seem quite \nordinary to others and about which I shall \nknow nothing. I shall not exist. . . ." \n\nHe looked at the row of birches shining in \nthe sunshine, with their motionless green and \nyellow foliage and white bark. "To die ... to \nbe killed tomorrow . . . That I should not \nexist . . . That all this should still be, but no \nme. . . ." \n\nAnd the birches with their light and shade, \nthe curly clouds, the smoke of the campfires, \nand all that was around him changed and \nseemed terrible and menacing. A cold shiver \nran down his spine. lie rose quickly, went out \nof the shed, and began to walk about. \n\nAfter he had returned, voices were heard \noutside the shed. "Who's that?" he cried. \n\nThe red-nosed Captain Timokhin, formerly \nD61okhov's squadron commander, but now \nfrom lack of officers a battalion commander, \nshyly entered the shed followed by an adju- \ntant and the regimental paymaster. \n\nPrince Andrew rose hastily, listened to the \nbusiness they had come about, gave them some \nfurther instructions, and was about to dismiss \nthem when he heard a familiar, lisping voice \nbehind the shed. \n\n"Devil take it!" said the voice of a man \nstumbling over something. \n\nPrince Andrew looked out of the shed and \nsaw Pierre, who had tripped over a pole on the \nground and had nearly fallen, coming his way. \nIt was unpleasant to Prince Andrew to meet \npeople of his own set in general, and Pierre \nespecially, for he reminded him of all the pain- \nful moments of his last visit to Moscow. \n\n"You? What a surprise!" said he. "What \nbrings you here? This is unexpected!" \n\nAs he said this his eyes and face expressed \nmore than coldness they expressed hostility, \nwhich Pierre noticed at once. He had ap- \nproached the shed full of animation, but on \nseeing Prince Andrew's face he felt constrained \nand ill at ease. \n\n"I have come . . . simply . . . you know . . . \ncome ... it interests me," said Pierre, who had \nso often that day senselessly repeated thatword \n"interesting." "I wish to see the battle." \n\n"Oh yes, and what do the Masonic brothers \nsay about war? How would they stop it?" said \nPrince Andrew sarcastically. "Well, and how's \nMoscow? And my people? Have they reached \nMoscow at last?" he asked seriously. \n\n"Yes, they have. Julie Drubetskaya told me \n\n\n\nso. I went to see them, but missed them. They \nhave gone to your estate near Moscow/' \n\nCHAPTER XXV \n\nTHE OFFICERS were about to take leave, but \nPrince Andrew, apparently reluctant to be left \nalone with his friend, asked them to stay and \nhave tea. Seats were brought in and so was the \ntea. The officers gazed with surprise at Pierre's \nhuge stout figure and listened to his talk of \nMoscow and the position of our army, round \nwhich he had ridden. Prince Andrew remained \nsilent, and his expression was so forbidding \nthat Pierre addressed his remarks chiefly to Ti- \nm6khin, the good-natured battalion com- \nmander. \n\n"So you understand the whole position of \nour troops?" Prince Andrew interrupted him. \n\n"Yes that is, how do you mean?" said Pierre. \n"Not being a military man I can't say I have \nunderstood it fully, but I understand the gen- \neral position." \n\n"Well, then, you know more than anyone \nelse, be it who it may," said Prince Andrew. \n\n"Oh!" said Pierre, looking over his spectacles \nin perplexity at Prince Andrew. "Well, and \nwhat do you think of Kutiizov's appointment?" \nhe asked. \n\n"I was very glad of his appointment, that's \nall I know," replied Prince Andrew. \n\n"And tell me your opinion of Barclay de \nTolly. In Moscow they are saying heaven knows \nwhat about him. . . . What do you think of \nhim?" \n\n"Ask them," replied Prince Andrew, indicat- \ning the officers. \n\nPierre looked at Timokhin with the conde- \nscendingly interrogative smile with which ev- \nerybody involuntarily addressed that officer. \n\n"We see light again, since his Serenity has \nbeen appointed, your excellency," said Timo- \nkhin timidly, and continually turning to glance \nat his colonel. \n\n"Why so?" asked Pierre. \n\n"Well, to mention only firewood and fodder, \nlet me inform you. Why, when we were retreat- \ning from Sventsyani we dare not touch a stick \nor a wisp of hay or anything. You see, we were \ngoing away, so he would get it all; wasn't it so, \nyour excellency?" and again Tim6khin turned \nto the prince. "But we daren't. In our regi- \nment two officers were court-martialed for that \nkind of thing. But when his Serenity took com- \nmand every thing became straightforward. Now \nwe see light. . . ." \n\n"Then why was it forbidden?" \n\n\n\nBOOK TEN \n\n\n\n441 \n\n\n\nTim6khin looked about in confusion, not \nknowing what or how to answer such a ques- \ntion. Pierre put the same question to Prince \nAndrew. \n\n"Why, so as not to lay waste the country we \nwere abandoning to the enemy," said Prince \nAndrewwith venomous irony. "It is very sound: \none can't permit the land to be pillaged and ac- \ncustom the troops to marauding. At Smolensk \ntoo he judged correctly that the French might \noutflank us, as they had larger forces. But he \ncould not understand this," cried Prince An- \ndrew in a shrill voice that seemed to escape \nhim involuntarily: "he could not understand \nthat there, for the first time, we were fighting \nfor Russian soil, and that there was a spirit in \nthe men such as I had never seen before, that \nwe had held the French for two days, and that \nthat success had increased ourstrength tenfold. \nHe ordered us to retreat, and all our efforts \nand losses went for nothing. He had no \nthought of betraying us, he tried to do the best \nhe could, he thought out everything, and that \nis why he is unsuitable. He is unsuitable now, \njust because he plans out everything very thor- \noughly and accurately as every German has to. \nHow can I explain? . . . Well, say your father \nhas a German valet, and he is a splendid valet \nand satisfies your father's requirements better \nthan you could, then it's all right to let him \nserve. But if your father is mortally sick you'll \nsend the valet away and attend to your father \nwith your own un practiced, awkward hands, \nand will soothe him better than a skilled man \nwho is a stranger could. So it has been with \nBarclay. While Russia was well, a foreigner \ncould serve her and be a splendid minister; but \nas soon as she is in danger she needs one of her \nown kin. But in your Club they have been mak- \ning him out a traitor! They slander him as a \ntraitor, and the only result will be that after- \nwards, ashamed of their false accusations, they \nwill make him out a hero or a genius instead of \na traitor, and that will be still more unjust. He \nis an honest and very punctilious German." \n\n"And they say he's a skillful commander," \nrejoined Pierre. \n\n"I don't understand what is meant by 'a skill- \nful commander/ "replied Prince Andrew iron- \nically. \n\n"A skillful commander?" replied Pierre. \n"Why, one who foresees all contingencies . . . \nand foresees the adversary's intentions." \n\n"But that's impossible," said Prince Andrew \nas if it were a matter settled long ago. \n\nPierre looked at him in surprise. \n\n\n\n"And yet they say that war is like a game of \nchess?" he remarked. \n\n"Yes," replied Prince Andrew, "but with this \nlittle difference, that in chess you may think \nover each move as long as you please and are \nnot limited for time, and with this difference \ntoo, that a knight is always stronger than a \npawn, and two pawns are always stronger than \none, while in war a battalion is sometimes \nstronger than a division and sometimes weaker \nthan a company. The relative strength of \nbodies of troops can never be known to any- \none. Believe me," he went on, "if things de- \npended on arrangements made by the staff, I \nshould be there making arrangements, but in- \nstead of that I have the honor to serve here in \nthe regiment with these gentlemen, and I con- \nsider that on us tomorrow's battle will depend \nand not on those others. . . . Success never de- \npends, and never will depend, on position, or \nequipment, or even on numbers, and least of \nall on position." \n\n"But on what then?" \n\n"On the feeling that is in me and in him," he \npointed to Tim6khin, "and in each soldier." \n\nPrince Andrew glanced at Timokhin, who \nlooked at his commander in alarm and bewil- \nderment. In contrast to his former reticent taci- \nturnity Prince Andrew now seemed excited. \nHe could apparently not refrain from express- \ning the thoughts that had suddenly occurred \nto him. \n\n"A battle is won by those who firmly resolve \nto win it! Why did we lose the battle at Auster- \nlitz? The French losses were almost equal to \nours, but very early we said to ourselves that we \nwere losing the battle, and we did lose it. And \nwe said so because we had nothing to fight for \nthere, we wanted to get away from the battle- \nfield as soon as we could. 'We've lost, so let us \nrun,' and we ran. If we had not said that till \nthe evening, heaven knows what might not \nhave happened. But tomorrow we shan't say \nit! You talk about our position, the left flank \nweak and the right flank too extended," he \nwent on. "That's all nonsense, there's nothing \nof the kind. But what awaits us tomorrow? A \nhundred million most diverse chances which \nwill be decided on the instant by the fact that \nour men or theirs run or do not run, and that \nthis man or that man is killed, but all that is \nbeing done at present is only play. The fact is \nthat those men with whom you have ridden \nround the position not only do not help mat- \nters, but hinder. They are only concerned with \ntheir own petty interests." \n\n\n\n44* \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\n"At such a moment?" said Pierre reproach- \nfully. \n\n"At such a moment!" Prince Andrew re- \npeated. "To them it is only a moment afford- \ning opportunities to undermine a rival and ob- \ntain an extra cross or ribbon. For me tomorrow \nmeans this: a Russian army of a hundred thou- \nsand and a French army of a hundred thousand \nhave met to fight, and the thing is that these \ntwo hundred thousand men will fight and the \nside that fights more fiercely and spares itself \nleast will win. And if you like I will tell you \nthat whatever happens and whatever muddles \nthose at the top may make, we shall win to- \nmorrow's battle. Tomorrow, happen what may, \nwe shall win!" \n\n"There now, your excellency! That's the \ntruth, the real truth," said Tim6khin. "Who \nwould spare himself now? The soldiers in my \nbattalion, believe me, wouldn't drink their \nvodka! 'It's not the day for that!' they say." \n\nAll were silent. The officers rose. Prince An- \ndrew went out of the shed with them, giving \nfinal orders to the adjutant. After they had gone \nPierre approached Prince Andrew and was \nabout to start a conversation when they heard \ntheclatter of three horses' hoof son the road not \nfar from the shed, and looking in that direction \nPrince Andrew recognized Wolzogen and \nClausewitz accompanied by a Cossack. They \nrode close by continuing to converse, and \nPrince Andrew involuntarily heard these \nwords: \n\n"Der Krieg muss in Raum verlegt werden. \nDer Ansicht kann ich nicht genug Preis ge- \nben" l said one of them. \n\n"Oh, ja" said the other, "der Zweck ist nur \nden Feind zu schwtichen, so kann man gewiss \nnicht den Verlust der Priv at-Personen in Ach- \ntung nehmen." * \n\n"Oh, no," agreed the other. \n\n"Extend widely!" said Prince Andrew with \nan angry snort, when they had ridden past. \n"In that 'extend' were my father, son, and sis- \nter, at Bald Hills. That's all the same to him! \nThat's what I was saying to youthose German \ngentlemen won't win the battle tomorrow but \nwill only make all the mess they can, because \nthey have nothing in their German heads but \ntheories not worth an empty eggshell and \nhaven't in their hearts the one thing needed to- \n\n1&lt;4 The war must be extended widely. I cannot \nsufficiently commend that view." \n\n* "Oh, yes, the only aim is to weaken the enemy, \nso of course one cannot take into account the loss \nof private individuals." \n\n\n\nmorrow that which Timokhin has. They have \nyielded up all Europe to him f and have now \ncome to teach us. Fine teachers!" and again his \nvoice grew shrill. \n\n"So you think we shall win tomorrow's bat- \ntle?" asked Pierre. \n\n"Yes, yes," answered Prince Andrew absent- \nly. "One thing I would do if I had the power," \nhe began again, "I would not take prisoners. \nWhy take prisoners? It's chivalry! The French \nhave destroyed my home and are on their way \nto destroy Moscow, they have outraged and are \noutraging me every moment. They are my ene- \nmies. In my opinion they are all criminals. And \nso thinks Timokhin and the whole army. They \nshould be executed! Since they are my foes they \ncannot be my friends, whatever may have been \nsaid at Tilsit." \n\n"Yes, yes," muttered Pierre, looking with \nshining eyes at Prince Andrew. "I quite agree \nwith you!" \n\nThe question that had perturbed Pierre on \nthe Mozhdysk hill and all that day now seemed \nto him quite clear and completely solved. He \nnow understood the whole meaning and im- \nportance of this war and of the impending bat- \ntle. All he had seen that day, all the significant \nand stern expressions on the faces he had seen \nin passing, were lit up for him by a new light. \nHe understood that latent heat (as they say \nin physics) of patriotism which was present in \nall these men he had seen, and this explained \nto him why they all prepared for death calmly, \nand as it were lightheartedly. \n\n"Not take prisoners," Prince Andrew con- \ntinued: "That by itself would quite change the \nwhole war and make it less cruel. As it is we \nhave played at war that's what's vile! We play \nat magnanimity and all that stuff. Such magna- \nnimity and sensibility are like the magnanimity \nand sensibility of a lady who faints when she \nsees a calf being killed: she is so kind-hearted \nthat she can't look at blood, but enjoys eat- \ning the calf served up with sauce. They talk to \nus of the rules of war, of chivalry, of flags of \ntruce, of mercy to the unfortunate and so on. \nIt's all rubbish! I saw chivalry and flags of truce \nin 1805; they humbugged us and we hum- \nbugged them. They plunder other people's \nhouses, issue false paper money, and worst of all \nthey kill my children and my father, and then \ntalk of rules of war and magnanimity to foes! \nTake no prisoners, but kill and be killed! He \nwho has come to this as I have through the \nsame sufferings ..." \n\nPrince Andrew, who had thought it was all \n\n\n\nBOOK TEN \n\n\n\n443 \n\n\n\nthe same to him whether or not Moscow was \ntaken as Smolensk had been, was suddenly \nchecked in his speech by an unexpected cramp \nin his throat. He paced up and down a few \ntimes in silence, but his eyes glittered feverish- \nly and his lips quivered as he began speaking. \n\n"If there was none of this magnanimity in \nwar, we should go to war only when it was \nworth while going to certain death, as now. \nThen there would not be war because Paul \nIvdnovich had offended Michael Ivnovich. \nAnd when there was a war, like this one, it \nwould be warl And then the detennination of \nthe troops would be quite different. Then all \nthese Westphalians and Hessians whom Na- \npoleon is leading would not follow him into \nRussia, and we should not go to fight in Aus- \ntria and Prussia without knowing why. War \nis not courtesy but the most horrible thing in \nlife; and we ought to understand that and not \nplay at war. We ought to accept this terrible \nnecessity sternly and seriously. It all lies in \nthat: get rid of falsehood and let war be war \nand not a game. As it is now, war is the favor- \nite pastime of the idle and frivolous. The mili- \ntary calling is the most highly honored. \n\n"But what is war? What is needed for suc- \ncess in warfare? What are the habits of the \nmilitary? The aim of war is murder; the meth- \nods of war are spying, treachery, and their en- \ncouragement, the ruin of a country's inhabit- \nants, robbing them or stealing to provision the \narmy, and fraud and falsehood termed mili- \ntary craft. The habits of the military class are \nthe absence of freedom, that is, discipline, idle- \nness, ignorance, cruelty, debauchery, and \ndrunkenness. And in spite of all this it is the \nhighest class, respected by everyone. All the \nkings, except the Chinese, wear military uni- \nforms, and he who kills most people receives \nthe highest rewards. \n\n"They meet, as we shall meet tomorrow, to \nmurder one another; they kill and maim tens \nof thousands, and then have thanksgiving serv- \nices for having killed so many people (they \neven exaggerate the number), and they an- \nnounce a victory, supposing that the more peo- \nple they have killed the greater their achieve- \nment. How does God above look at them and \nhear them?" exclaimed Prince Andrew in a \nshrill, piercing voice. "Ah, my friend, it has of \nlate become hard for me to live. I see that I \nhave begun to understand too much. And it \ndoesn't do for man to taste of the tree of knowl- \nedge of good and evil. . . . Ah, well, it's not for \nlongl" he added. \n\n\n\n"However, you're sleepy, and it's time for \nme to sleep. Go back to G6rkil" said Prince \nAndrew suddenly. \n\n"Oh, nol" Pierre replied, looking at Prince \nAndrew with frightened, compassionate eyes. \n\n"Go, gol Before a battle one must have one's \nsleep out," repeated Prince Andrew. \n\nHe came quickly up to Pierre and embraced \nand kissed him. \n\n"Good-by, be offl" he shouted. "Whether \nwe meet again or not . . ." and turning away \nhurriedly he entered the shed. \n\nIt was already dark, and Pierre could not \nmake out whether the expression of Prince \nAndrew's face was angry or tender. \n\nFor some time he stood in silence consider- \ning whether he should follow him or go away. \n"No, he does not want itl" Pierre concluded. \n"And I know that this is our last meeting!" He \nsighed deeply and rode back to G6rki. \n\nOn re-entering the shed Prince Andrew lay \ndown on a rug, but he could not sleep. \n\nHe closed his eyes. One picture succeeded \nanother in his imagination. On one of them he \ndwelt long and joyfully. He vividly recalled an \nevening in Petersburg. Natdsha with animated \nand excited face was telling him how she had \ngone to look for mushrooms the previous sum- \nmer and had lost her way in the big forest. She \nincoherently described the depths of the forest, \nher feelings, and a talk with a beekeeper she \nmet, and constantly interrupted her story to \nsay: "No, I can't! I'm not telling it right; no, \nyou don't understand," though he encouraged \nher by saying that he did understand, and he \nreally had understood all she wanted to say. \nBut Natasha was not satisfied with her own \nwords: she felt that they did not convey the \npassionately poetic feeling she had experi- \nenced that day and wished to convey. "He was \nsuch a delightful old man, and it was so dark \nin the forest . . . and he had such kind . . . No, \nI can't describe it," she had said, flushed and \nexcited. Prince Andrew smiled now the same \nhappy smile as then when he had looked into \nher eyes. "I understood her," he thought. "I \nnot only understood her, but it was just that \ninner, spiritual force, that sincerity, that frank- \nness of soulthat very soul of hers which \nseemed to be fettered by her body it was that \nsoul I loved in her . . . loved so strongly and \nhappily . . ." and suddenly he remembered how \nhis love had ended. "He did not need anything \nof that kind. He neither saw nor understood \nanything of the sort. He only saw in her a \npretty and fresh young girl, with whom he did \n\n\n\n444 \n\n\n\nnot deign to unite his fate. And I? . \nis still alive and gay!" \n\nPrince Andrew jumped upas if someone had \nburned him, and again began pacing up and \ndown in front of the shed. \n\nCHAPTER XXVI \n\nON AUGUST 25, the eve of the battle of Boro- \ndin6, M. de Beausset, prefect of the French \nEmperor's palace, arrived at Napoleon's quar- \nters at Valuevo with Colonel Fabvier, the form- \ner from Paris and the latter from Madrid. \n\nDonning his court uniform, M. de Beausset \nordered a box he had brought for the Emperor \nto be carried before him and entered the first \ncompartment of Napoleon's tent, where he be- \ngan opening the boxwhile conversingwith Na- \npoleon's aides-de-camp who surrounded him. \n\nFabvier, not entering the tent, remained at \nthe entrance talking to some generals of his \nacquaintance. \n\nThe Emperor Napoleon had not yet left his \nbedroom and was finishing his toilet. Slightly \nsnorting and grunting, he presented now his \nback and now his plump hairy chest to the \nbrush with which his valet was rubbing him \ndown. Another valet, with his finger over the \nmouth of a bottle, was sprinkling Eau de Co- \nlogne on the Emperor's pampered body with \nan expression which seemed to say that he \nalone knew where and how much Eau de Co- \nlogne should be sprinkled. Napoleon's short \nhair was wet and matted on the forehead, but \nhis face, though puffy and yellow, expressed \nphysical satisfaction. "Go on, harder, go onl" \nhe muttered to the valet who was rubbing him, \nslightly twitching and grunting. An aide-de- \ncamp, who had entered the bedroom to report \nto the Emperor the number of prisoners taken \nin yesterday's action, was standing by the door \nafter delivering his message, awaiting permis- \nsion to withdraw. Napoleon, frowning, looked \nat him from under his brows. \n\n"No prisoners!" said he, repeating the aide- \nde-camp's words. "They are forcing us to exter- \nminate them. So much the worse for the Rus- \nsian army. ... Go on ... harder, harder!" he \nmuttered, hunching his back and presenting \nhis fat shoulders. \n\n"All right. Let Monsieur de Beausset enter, \nand Fabvier too/' he said, nodding to the aide- \nde-camp. \n\n"Yes, sire," and the aide-de-camp disappeared \nthrough the door of the tent. \n\nTwo valets rapidly dressed His Majesty, and \nwearing the blue uniform of the Guards he \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\nand he \n\n\n\nwent with firm quick steps to the reception \nroom. \n\nDe Beausset's hands meanwhile were busily \nengaged arranging the present he had brought \nfrom the Empress, on two chairs directly in \nfront of the entrance. But Napoleon had \ndressed and come out with such unexpected ra- \npidity that he had not time to finish arranging \nthe surprise. \n\nNapoleon noticed at once what they were \nabout and guessed that they were not ready. \nHe did not wish to deprive them of the pleas- \nure of giving him a surprise, so he pretended \nnot to see de Beausset and called Fabvier to \nhim, listening silently and with a stern frown \nto what Fabvier told him of the heroism and \ndevotion of his troops fighting at Salamanca, \nat the other end of Europe, with but one \nthought to be worthy of their Emperor and \nbut one fear to fail to please him. The result \nof that battle had been deplorable. Napoleon \nmade ironic remarks during Fabvier's account, \nas if he had not expected that matters could go \notherwise in his absence. \n\n"I must make up for that in Moscow," said \nNapoleon. "I'll see you later," he added, and \nsummoned de Beausset, who by that time had \nprepared the surprise, having placed something \non the chairs and covered it with a cloth. \n\nDe Beausset bowed low, with that courtly \nFrench bow which only the old retainers of \nthe Bourbons knew how to make, and ap* \npreached him, presenting an envelope. \n\nNapoleon turned to him gaily and pulled his \near. \n\n"You have hurried here. I am very glad. Well, \nwhat is Paris saying?" he asked, suddenly \nchanging his former stern expression fora most \ncordial tone. \n\n"Sire, all Paris regrets your absence," re- \nplied de Beausset as was proper. \n\nBut though Napoleon knew that de Beaus- \nset had to say something of this kind, and \nthough in his lucid moments he knew it was \nuntrue, he was pleased to hear it from him. \nAgain he honored him by touching his ear. \n\n"I am very sorry to have made you travel so \nfar," said he. \n\n"Sire, I expected nothing less than to find \nyou at the gates of Moscow," replied de Beaus- \nset. \n\nNapoleon smiled and, lifting his head absent- \nmindedly, glanced to the right. An aide-de-camp \napproached with gliding steps and offered him \na gold snuffbox, which he took. \n\n"Yes, it has happened luckily for you," he \n\n\n\nBOOK TEN \n\n\n\n445 \n\n\n\nsaid, raising the open snuffbox to his nose. \n"You are fond of travel, and in three days you \nwill see Moscow. You surely did not expect to \nsee that Asiatic capital. You will have a pleas- \nant journey." \n\nDe Beausset bowed gratefully at this regard \nfor his taste for travel (of which he had not \ntill then been aware). \n\n"Ha, what's this?" asked Napoleon, noticing \nthat all the courtiers were looking at some- \nthing concealed under a cloth. \n\nWith courtly adroitness de Beausset half \nturned and without turning his back to the \nEmperor retired two steps, twitching off the \ncloth at the same time, and said: \n\n"A present to Your Majesty from the Em- \npress." \n\nIt was a portrait, painted in bright colors by \nGerard, of the son iDorne to Napoleon by the \ndaughter of the Emperor of Austria, the boy \nwhom for some reason everyone called "The \nKing of Rome." \n\nA very pretty curly-headed boy with a look \nof the Christ in the Sistine Madonna was de- \npicted playing at stick and ball. The ball rep- \nresented the terrestrial globe and the stick in \nhis other hand a scepter. \n\nThough it was not clear what the artist meant \nto express by depicting the so-called King of \nRome spiking the earth with a stick, the alle- \ngory apparently seemed to Napoleon, as it \nhad done to all who had seen it in Paris, quite \nclear and very pleasing. \n\n"The King of Rome!" he said, pointing to \nthe portrait with a graceful gesture. "Admi- \nrable!" \n\nWith the natural capacity of an Italian for \nchanging the expression of his face at will, he \ndrew nearer to the portrait and assumed a \nlook of pensive tenderness. He felt that what \nhe now said and did would be historical, and \nit seemed to him that it would now be best for \nhim whose grandeur enabled his son to play \nstick and ball with the terrestrial globe to \nshow, in contrast to that grandeur, the sim- \nplest paternal tenderness. His eyes grew dim, \nhe moved forward, glanced round at a chair \n(which seemed to place itself under him), and \nsat down on it before the portrait. At a single \ngesture from him everyone went out on tiptoe, \nleaving the great man to himself and his emo- \ntion. \n\nHaving sat still for a while he touched him- \nself not knowing why the thick spot of paint \nrepresenting the highest light in the portrait, \nrose, and recalled de Beausset and the officer \n\n\n\non duty. He ordered the portrait to be carried \noutside his tent, that the Old Guard, stationed \nround it, might not be deprived of the pleas- \nure of seeing the King of Rome, the son and \nheir of their adored monarch. \n\nAnd while lie was doing M. de Beausset the \nhonor of breakfasting with him, they heard, as \nNapoleon had anticipated, the rapturous cries \nof the officers and men of the Old Guard who \nhad run up to see the portrait. \n\n"Vive I'Empereur! Vive le roi de Rome! Vive \nI'Empereur!" came those ecstatic cries. \n\nAfter breakfast Napoleon in de Beausset's \npresence dictated his order of the day to the \narmy. \n\n"Short and energetic!" he remarked when he \nhad read over the proclamation which he had \ndictated straight off without corrections. It \nran: \n\nSoldiers! This is the battle you have so longed \nfor. Victory depends on you. It is essential for us; \nit will give us all we need: comfortable quarters \nand a speedy return to our country. Behave as you \ndid at Austerlkz, Friedland, Vitebsk, and Srno- \n16nsk. Let our remotest posterity recall your \nachievements this day with pride. Let it be said of \neach of you: "He was in the great battle before \nMoscow 1" \n\n"Before Moscow!" repeated Napoleon, and \ninviting M. de Beausset, who was so fond of \ntravel, to accompany him on his ride, he went \nout of the tent to where the horses stood sad- \ndled. \n\n"Your Majesty is too kind! "replied de Beaus- \nset to the invitation to accompany the Emper- \nor; he wanted to sleep, did not know how to \nride and was afraid of doing so. \n\nBut Napoleon nodded to the traveler, and \nde Beausset had to mount. When Napoleon \ncame out of the tent theshouting of the Guards \nbefore his son's portrait grew still louder. Na- \npoleon frowned. \n\n"Take him away!" he said, pointing with a \ngracefully majestic gesture to the portrait. "It \nis too soon for him to see a field of battle." \n\nDe Beausset closed his eyes, bowed his head, \nand sighed deeply, to indicate how profoundly \nhe valued and comprehended the Emperor's \nwords. \n\nCHAPTER XXVII \n\nON THE TWENTY-FIFTH OF AUGUST, SO his histO- \n\nrians tell us, Napoleon spent the whole day on \nhorseback inspecting the locality, considering \nplans submitted to him by his marshals, and \npersonally giving commands to his generals. \n\n\n\n446 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nThe original line of the Russian forces along \nthe river KolochA had been dislocated by the \ncapture of the Shevdrdino Redoubt on the \ntwenty-fourth, and part of the linethe left \nflank had been drawn back. That part of the \nline was not entrenched and in front of it the \nground was more open and level than else- \nwhere. It was evident to anyone, military or \nnot, that it was here the French should attack. \nIt would seem that not much consideration \nwas needed to reach this conclusion, nor any \nparticular care or trouble on the part of the \nEmperor and his marshals, nor was there any \nneed of that special and supreme quality \ncalled genius that people are so apt to ascribe \nto Napoleon; yet the historians who described \nthe event later and the men who then sur- \nrounded Napoleon, and he himself, thought \notherwise. \n\nNapoleon rode over the plain and surveyed \nthe locality with a profound air and in silence, \nnodded with approval or shook his head du- \nbiously, and without communicating to the \ngenerals around him the profound course of \nideas which guided his decisions merely gave \nthem his final conclusions in the form of com- \nmands. Having listened to a suggestion from \nDavout,who was now called Prince d'Eckmiihl, \nto turn the Russian left wing, Napoleon said \nit should not be done, without explaining why \nnot. To a proposal made by General Campan \n(who was to attack the fleches) to lead his divi- \nsion through the woods, Napoleon agreed, \nthough the so-called Duke of Elchingen (Ney) \nventured to remark that a movement through \nthe woods was dangerous and might disorder \nthe division. \n\nHaving inspected the country opposite the \nShevardino Redoubt, Napoleon pondered a \nlittle in silence and then indicated the spots \nwhere two batteries should be set up by the \nmorrow to act against the Russian entrench- \nments, and the places where, in line with them, \nthe field artillery should be placed. \n\nAfter giving these and other commands he \nreturned to his tent, and the dispositions for \nthe battle were written down from his dicta- \ntion. \n\nThese dispositions, of which the French his- \ntorians write with enthusiasm and other his- \ntorians with profound respect, were as follows: \n\nAt dawn the two new batteries established dur- \ning the night on the plain occupied by the Prince \nd'Eckmiihl will open fire on the two opposing \nbatteries of the enemy. \n\nAt the same time the commander of the artil- \n\n\n\nlery of the ist Corps, General Pernetti, with thirty \ncannon of Campan's division and all the howitzers \nof Dessaix's and Friant's divisions, will move for- \nward, open fire, and overwhelm with shellfire the \nenemy's battery, against which will operate: \n\n24 guns of the artillery of the Guards \n30 guns of Campan's division \nand 8 guns of Friant's and Dessaix's divisions \n\nin all 62 guns. \n\nThe commander of the artillery of the grd \nCorps, General Fouch, will place the howitzers of \nthe srd and 8th Corps, sixteen in all, on the flanks \nof the battery that is to bombard the entrench- \nment on the left, which will have forty guns in \nall directed against it. \n\nGeneral Sorbier must be ready at the first order \nto advance with all the howitzers of the Guard's \nartillery against either one or other of the en- \ntrenchments. \n\nDuring the cannonade Prince Poniatowski is to \nadvance through the wood on the village and turn \nthe enemy's position. \n\nGeneral Campan will move through the wood \nto seize the first fortification. \n\nAfter the advance has begun in this manner, \norders will be given in accordance with the en- \nemy's movements. \n\nThe cannonade on the left flank will begin as \nsoon as the guns of the right wing are heard. The \nsharpshooters of Morand's division and of the \nvice-King's 1 division will open a heavy fire on see- \ning the attack commence on the right wing. \n\nThe vice-King will occupy the village and cross \nby its three bridges, advancing to the same heights \nas Morand's and Gerard's divisions, which under \nhis leadership will be directed against the redoubt \narid come into line with the rest of the forces. \n\nAll this must be done in good order (le tout se \nfera avec ordre et melhode) as far as possible re- \ntaining troops in reserve. \n\nThe Imperial Camp near Mozhdysk, \n\nSeptember, 6, 2 1812. \n\nThese dispositions, which are very obscure \nand confused if one allows oneself to regard \nthe arrangements without religious awe of his \ngenius, related to Napoleon's orders to deal \nwith four points four different orders. Not \none of these was, or could be, carried out. \n\nIn the disposition it is said first that the bat- \nteries placed on the spot chosen by Napoleon, \nwith the guns of Pernetti and Fouche 1 which \nwere to come in line with them, 102 guns in \nall, were to open fire and shower shells on the \nRussian fldches and redoubts. This could not \n\n1 Murat.-TR. \n\n8 The date of this French proclamation is New \nStyle, and corresponds to August 25, Old Style. \nTR. \n\n\n\nBOOK \n\nbe done, as from the spots selected by Napo- \nleon the projectiles did not carry to the Russian \nworks, and those 102 guns shot into the air un- \ntil the nearest commander, contrary to Napo- \nleon's instructions, moved them forward. \n\nThe second order was that Poniatowski, \nmoving to the village through the wood, should \nturn the Russian left flank. This could not be \ndone and was not done, because Poniatowski, \nadvancing on the village through the wood, \nmet Tuchk6v there barring his way, and could \nnot and did not turn the Russian position. \n\nThe third order was: General Campan will \nmove through the wood to seize the first forti- \nfication. General Campan's division did not \nseize the first fortification but was driven back, \nfor on emerging from the wood it had to re- \nform under grapeshot, of which Napoleon was \nunaware. \n\nThe fourth order was: The vice-King will \noccupy the village (Borodin6) and cross by its \nthree bridges, advancing to the same heights \nas Morand's and Gerard's divisions (for whose \nmovements no directions are given), which un- \nder his leadership will be directed against the \nredoubt and come into line with the rest of \nthe forces. \n\nAs far as one can make out, not so much from \nthis unintelligible sentence as from the at- \ntempts the vice-King made to execute the or- \nders given him, he was to advance from the \nleft through Borodino to the redoubt while the \ndivisions of Morand and Gerard were to ad- \nvance simultaneously from the front. \n\nAll this, like the other parts of the disposi- \ntion, was not and could not be executed. Aft- \ner passing through Borodino the vice-King was \ndriven back to the Kolocha and could get no \nfarther; while the divisions of Morand and Ge*- \nrard did not take the redoubt but were driv- \nen back, and the redoubt was only taken at the \nend of the battle by the cavalry (a thing prob- \nably unforeseen and not heard of by Napoleon). \nSo not one of the orders in the disposition was, \nor could be, executed. But in the disposition \nit is said that, after the fight has commenced in \nthis manner, orders will be given in accordance \nwith the enemy's movements, and so it might \nbe supposed that all necessary arrangements \nwould be made by Napoleon during the bat- \ntle. But this was not and could not be done, \nfor during the whole battle Napoleon was \nso far away that, as appeared later, he could \nnot know the course of the battle and not \none of his orders during the fight could be \nexecuted. \n\n\n\nTEN 447 \n\nCHAPTER XXVIII \n\nMANY HISTORIANS SAY that the French did not \nwin the battle of Borodin6 because Napoleon \nhad a cold, and that if he had not had a cold \nthe orders he gave before and during the bat- \ntle would have been still more full of genius \nand Russia would have been lost and the face \nof the world have been changed. To historians \nwho believe that Russia was shaped by the \nwill of one manPeter the Great and that \nFrance from a republic became an empire and \nFrench armies went to Russia at the will of \none man Napoleon to say that Russia re- \nmained a power because Napoleon had a bad \ncold on the twenty-fourth of August may seem \nlogical and convincing. \n\nIf it had depended on Napoleon's will to fight \nor not to fight the battle of Borodin6, and if \nthis or that other arrangement depended on \nhis will, then evidently a cold affecting the \nmanifestation of his will might have saved Rus- \nsia, and consequently the valet who omitted \nto bring Napoleon his waterproof boots on the \ntwenty-fourth would have been the savior of \nRussia. Along that line of thought such a de- \nduction is indubitable, as indubitable as the \ndeduction Voltaire made in jest (without \nknowing what he was jesting at) when he saw \nthat the Massacre of St. Bartholomew was due \nto Charles IX's stomach being deranged. But \nto men who do not admit that Russia was \nformed by the will of one man, Peter I, or that \nthe French Empire was formed and the war \nwith Russia begun by the will of one man, Na- \npoleon, that argument seems not merely un- \ntrue and irrational, but contrary to all human \nreality. To the question of what causes historic \nevents another answer presents itself, namely, \nthat the course of human events is predeter- \nmined from on high depends on the coinci- \ndence of the wills of all who take part in the \nevents, and that a Napoleon's influence on the \ncourse of these events is purely external and \nfictitious. \n\nStrange as at first glance it may seem to sup- \npose that the Massacre of St. Bartholomew was \nnot due to Charles IX's will, though he gave \nthe order for it and thought it was done as a \nresult of that order; and strange as it may seem \nto suppose that the slaughter of eighty thou- \nsand men at Borodin6 was not due to Napo- \nleon's will, though he ordered the commence- \nment and conduct of the battle and thought it \nwas done because he ordered it; strange as \nthese suppositions appear, yet human dignity \nwhich tells me that each of us is, if not more \n\n\n\n448 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nat least not less a man than the great Napole- \nondemands the acceptance of that solution of \nthe question, and historic investigation abun- \ndantly confirms it. \n\nAt the battle of Borodin6 Napoleon shot at \nno one and killed no one. That was all done \nby the soldiers. Therefore it was not he who \nkilled people. \n\nThe French soldiers went to kill and be \nkilled at the battle of Borodin6 not because of \nNapoleon's orders but by their own volition. \nThe whole army French, Italian, German, \nPolish, and Dutch hungry, ragged, and weary \nof the campaign, felt at the sight of an army \nblocking their road to Moscow that the wine \nwas drawn and must be drunk. Had Napoleon \nthen forbidden them to fight the Russians, they \nwould have killed him and have proceeded to \nfight the Russians because it was inevitable. \n\nWhen they heard Napoleon's proclamation \noffering them, as compensation for mutilation \nand death, the words of posterity about their \nhaving been in the battle before Moscow, they \ncried "Vive I'Empereur!" just as they had cried \n"Vive I'Empereur!" at the sight of the portrait \nof the boy piercing the terrestrial globe with a \ntoy stick, and just as they would have cried \n"Vive I'Empereur !" at any nonsense that might \nbe told them. There was nothing left for them \nto do but cry "Vive I'Empereur!" and go to \nfight, in order to get food and rest as conquer- \nors in Moscow. So it was not because of Napo- \nleon's commands that they killed their fellow \nmen. \n\nAnd it was not Napoleon who directed the \ncourse of the battle, for none of his orders were \nexecuted and during the battle he did not \nknow what was going on before him. So the \nway in which these people killed one another \nwas not decided by Napoleon's will but oc- \ncurred independently of him, in accord with \nthe will of hundreds of thousands of people \nwho took part in the common action. It only \nseemed to Napoleon that it all took place by \nhis will. And so the question whether he had \nor had not a cold has no more historic interest \nthan the cold of the least of the transport sol- \ndiers. \n\nMoreover, the assertion made by various writ- \ners that his cold was the cause of his disposi- \ntions not being as well planned as on former \noccasions, and of his orders during the battle \nnot being as good as previously, is quite base- \nless, which again shows that Napoleon's cold \non the twenty-sixth of August was unimpor- \ntant. \n\n\n\nThe dispositions cited above are not at all \nworse, but are even better, than previous dis- \npositions by which he had won victories. His \npseudo-orders during the battle were also no \nworse than formerly, but much the same as us- \nual. These dispositions and orders only seem \nworse than previous ones because the battle of \nBorodin6 was the first Napoleon did not win. \nThe profounclest and most excellent disposi- \ntions and orders seem very bad, and every \nlearned militarist criticizes them with looks of \nimportance, when they relate to a battle that \nhas been lost, and the very worst dispositions \nand orders seem very good, and serious people \nfill whole volumes to demonstrate their merits, \nwhen they relate to a battle that has been won. \n\nThe dispositions drawn up by Weyrother \nfor the battle of Austerlitz were a model of per- \nfection for that kind of composition, but still \nthey were criticized criticized for their very \nperfection, for their excessive minuteness. \n\nNapoleon at the battle of Borodin6 fulfilled \nhis office as representative of authority as well \nas, and even better than, at other battles. He \ndid nothing harmful to the progress of the bat- \ntle; he inclined to the most reasonable opin- \nions, he made no confusion, did not contradict \nhimself, did not get frightened or run away \nfrom the field of battle, but with his great tact \nand military experience carried out his role of \nappearing to command, calmly and with dig- \nnity. \n\nCHAPTER XXIX \n\nON RETURNING fromasecond careful inspection \nof the lines, Napoleon remarked: \n\n"The chessmen are set up, the game will be- \ngin tomorrow I" \n\nHaving ordered punch and summoned de \nBeausset, he began to talk to him about Paris \nand about some changes he meant to make in \nthe Empress' household, surprising the prefect \nby his memory of minute details relating to the \ncourt. \n\nHe showed an interest in trifles, joked about \nde Beausset's love of travel, and chatted care- \nlessly, as a famous, self-confident surgeon who \nknows his job does when turning up his sleeves \nand putting on his apron while a patient is be- \ning strapped to the operating table. "The mat- \nter is in my hands and is clear and definite in \nmy head. When the times comes to set to work \nI shall do it as no one else could, but now I can \njest, and the more I jest and the calmer I am \nthe more tranquil and confident you ought to \nbe, and the more amazed at my genius." \n\n\n\nBOOK \n\nHaving finished his second glass of punch, \nNapoleon went to rest before the serious busi- \nness which, he considered, awaited him next \nday. He was so much interested in that task that \nhe was unable to sleep, and in spite of his cold \nwhich had grown worse from the dampness of \nthe evening, he went into the large division of \nthe tent at three o'clock in the morning, loudly \nblowing his nose. He asked whether the Rus- \nsians had not withdrawn, and was told that the \nenemy's fires were still in the same places. He \nnodded approval. \n\nThe adjutant in attendance came into the \ntent. \n\n"Well, Rapp, do you think we shall do good \nbusiness today?" Napoleon asked him. \n\n"Without doubt, sire," replied Rapp. \n\nNapoleon looked at him. \n\n"Do you remember, sire, what you did me the \nhonor to say at Smolensk?" continued Rapp. \n"The wine is drawn and must be drunk." \n\nNapoleon frowned and sat silent for a long \ntime leaning his head on his hand. \n\n"This poor army!" he suddenly remarked. \n"Jt has diminished greatly since Smolensk. For- \ntune is frankly a courtesan, Rapp. I have al- \nways said so and I am beginning to experience \nit. But the Guards, Rapp, the Guards are in- \ntact?" he remarked interrogatively. \n\n"Yes, sire," replied Rapp. \n\nNapoleon took a lozenge, put it in his mouth, \nand glanced at his watch. He was not sleepy \nand it was still not nearly morning. It was im- \npossible to give further orders for the sake of \nkilling time, for the orders had all been given \nand were now being executed. \n\n"Have the biscuits and rice been served out \nto the regiments of the Guards?" asked Napo- \nleon sternly. \n\n"Yes, sire." \n\n"The rice too?" \n\nRapp replied that he had given the Emper- \nor's order about the rice, but Napoleon shook \nhis head in dissatisfaction as if not believing \nthat his order had been executed. An attend- \nant came in with punch. Napoleon ordered an- \nother glass to be brought for Rapp, and silent- \nly sipped his own. \n\n"I have neither taste nor smell," he remarked, \nsniffing at his glass. "This cold is tiresome. \nThey talk about medicinewhat is the good of \nmedicine when it can't cure a coldl Corvisart \ngave me these lozenges but they don't help at \nall. What can doctors cure? One can't cure \nanything. Our body is a machine for living. It \nis organized for that, it is its nature. Let life go \n\n\n\nTEN 449 \n\non in it unhindered and let it defend itself, it \nwill do more than if you paralyze it by encum- \nbering it with remedies. Our body is like a \nperfect watch that should go for a certain time; \nthe watchmaker cannot open it, he can only ad- \njust it by fumbling, and that blindfold. . . . \nYes, our body is a machine for living, that is all." \nAnd having entered on the path of defini- \ntion, of which he was fond, Napoleon suddenly \nand unexpectedly gave a new one. \n\n"Do you know, Rapp, what military art is?" \nasked he. "It is the art of being stronger than \nthe enemy at a given moment. That's all." \n\nRapp made no reply. \n\n"Tomorrow we shall have to deal with Ku- \ntuzov!" said Napoleon. "We shall see! Do you \nremember at Braunau he commanded an army \nfor three weeks and did not once mount a \nhorse to inspect his entrenchments. . . . We \nshall see!" \n\nHe looked at his watch. It was still only four \no'clock. He did not feel sleepy. The punch was \nfinished and there was still nothing to do. He \nrose, walked to and fro, put on a warm over- \ncoat and a hat, and went out of the tent. The \nnight was dark and damp, a scarcely percepti- \nble moisture was descending from above. Near \nby, the campfires were dimly burning among \nthe French Guards, and in the distance those \nof the Russian line shone through the smoke. \nThe weather was calm, and the rustle and \ntramp of the French troops already beginning \nto move to take up their positions were clearly \naudible. \n\nNapoleon walked about in front of his tent, \nlooked at the fires and listened to these sounds, \nand as he was passing a tall guardsman in a \nshaggy cap, who was standing sentinel before \nhis tent and had drawn himself up like a black \npillar at sight of the Emperor, Napoleon \nstopped in front of him. \n\n"What year did you enter the service?" he \nasked with that affectation of military blunt- \nness and geniality with which he always ad- \ndressed the soldiers. \n\nThe man answered the question. \n\n"Ah! One of the old onesl Has your regi- \nment had its rice?" \n\n"It has, Your Majesty." \n\nNapoleon nodded and walked away. \n\nAt half-past five Napoleon rode to the vil- \nlage of Shevardino. \n\nIt was growing light, the sky was clearing, on- \nly a single cloud lay in the east. The aban- \ndoned campfires were burning themselves out \n\n\n\n45 \n\nin the faint morning light. \n\nOn the right a single deep report of a can- \nnon resounded and died away in the prevail- \ning silence. Some minutes passed. A second and \na third report shook the air, then a fourth and \na fifth boomed solemnly near by on the right. \n\nThe first shots had not yet ceased to rever- \nberate before others rang out and yet more \nwere heard mingling with and overtaking one \nanother. \n\nNapoleon with his suite rode up to the She- \nvdrdino Redoubt where he dismounted. The \ngame had begun. \n\nCHAPTER XXX \n\nON RETURNING to G6rki after having seen \nPrince Andrew, Pierre ordered his groom to \nget the horses ready and to call him early in the \nmorning, and then immediately fell asleep be- \nhind a partition in a corner Boris had given \nup to him. \n\nBefore he was thoroughly awake next morn- \ning everybody had already left the hut. The \npanes were rattling in the little windows and \nhis groom was shaking him. \n\n"Your excellency! Your excellency! Your ex- \ncellency I" he kept repeating pertinaciously \nwhile he shook Pierre by the shoulder without \nlooking at him, having apparently lost hope \nof getting him to wake up. \n\n"What? Has it begun? Is it time?" Pierre \nasked, waking up. \n\n"Hear the firing," said the groom, a dis- \ncharged soldier. "All the gentlemen have gone \nout, and his Serene Highness himself rode past \nlong ago." \n\nPierre dressed hastily and ran out to the \nporch. Outside all was bright, fresh, dewy, and \ncheerful. The sun, just bursting forth from be- \nhind a cloud that had concealed it, was shining, \nwith rays still half broken by the clouds, over \nthe roofs of the street opposite, on the dew- \nbesprinkled dust of the road, on the walls of \nthe houses, on the windows, the fence, and on \nPierre's horses standing before the hut. The \nroar of guns sounded more distinct outside. An \nadjutant accompanied by a Cossack passed by \nat a sharp trot. \n\n"It's time, Count; it's time!" cried the adju- \ntant. \n\nTelling the groom to follow him with the \nhorses, Pierre went down the street to the knoll \nfrom which he had looked at the field of battle \nthe day before. A crowd of military men was \nassembled there, members of the staff could be \nheard conversing in French, and Kuttizov's \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\ngray head in a white cap with a red band was \nvisible, his gray nape sunk between his shoul- \nders. He was looking through a field glass down \nthe highroad before him. \n\nMounting the steps to the knoll Pierre looked \nat the scene before him, spellbound by its beau- \nty. It was the same panorama he had admired \nfrom that spot the day before, but now the \nwhole place was full of troops and covered by \nsmoke clouds from the guns, and the slanting \nrays of the bright sun, rising slightly to the left \nbehind Pierre, cast upon it through the clear \nmorning air penetrating streaks of rosy, golden- \ntinted light and long dark shadows. The forest \nat the farthest extremity of the panorama \nseemed carved in some precious stone of a yel- \nlowish-green color; its undulating outline was \nsilhouetted against the horizon and was pierced \nbeyond Valuevo by the Smolensk highroad \ncrowded with troops. Nearer at hand glittered \ngolden cornfields interspersed with copses. \nThere were troops to be seen everywhere, in \nfront and to the right and left. All this was \nvivid, majestic, and unexpected; but what im- \npressed Pierre most of all was the view of the \nbattlefield itself, of Borodin6 and the hollows \non both sides of the Kolocha\ \n\nAbove the Kolocha, in Borodin6 and on \nboth sides of it, especially to the left where the \nV6yna flowing between its marshy banks falls \ninto the Kolochd, a mist had spread which \nseemed to melt, to dissolve, and to become \ntranslucent when the brilliant sun appeared \nand magically colored and outlined every thing. \nThe smoke of the guns mingled with this mist, \nand over the whole expanse and through that \nmist the rays of the morning sun were reflect- \ned, flashing back like lightning from the water, \nfrom the dew, and from the bayonets of the \ntroops crowded together by the riverbanks \nand in Borodin6. A white church could be \nseen through the mist, and here and there the \nroofs of huts in Borodin6 as well as dense \nmasses of soldiers, or green ammunition chests \nand ordnance. And all this moved, or seemed \nto move, as the smoke and mist spread out over \nthe whole space. Just as in the mist-enveloped \nhollow near Borodin6, so along the entire line \noutside and above it and especially in the \nwoods and fields to the left, in the valleys and \non the summits of the high ground, clouds of \npowder smoke seemed continually to spring \nup out of nothing, now singly, now several at \na time, some translucent, others dense, which, \nswelling, growing, rolling, and blending, ex- \ntended over the whole expanse. \n\n\n\nBOOK TEN \n\n\n\n45' \n\n\n\nThese puffs of smoke and (strange to say) \nthe sound of the firing produced the chief beau- \nty of the spectacle. \n\n"Puff!" suddenly a round compact cloud of \nsmoke was seen merging from violet into gray \nand milky white, and "boom!" came the re- \nport a second later. \n\n"Puff! puff!" and two clouds arose pushing \none another and blending together; and \n"boom, boom!" came the sounds confirming \nwhat the eye had seen. \n\nPierre glanced round at the first cloud, which \nhe had seen as a round compact ball, and in its \nplace already were balloons of smoke floating \nto one side, and "puff" (with a pause) "puff, \npuff!" three and then four more appeared \nand then from each, with the same interval \n"boom boom, boom!" came the fine, firm, \nprecise sounds in reply. It seemed as if those \nsmoke clouds sometimes ran and sometimes \nstood still while woods, fields, and glittering \nbayonets ran past them. From the left, over \nfields and bushes, those large balls of smoke \nwere continually appearing followed by their \nsolemn reports, while nearer still, in the hol- \nlows and woods, there burst from the muskets \nsmall cloudlets that had no time to become \nballs, but had their little echoes in just the \nsame way. "Trakh-ta-ta-takh!" came the fre- \nquent crackle of musketry, but it was irregular \nand feeble in comparison with the reports of \nthe cannon. \n\nPierre wished to be there with that smoke, \nthose shining bayonets, that movement, and \nthose sounds. He turned to look at Kutuzov \nand his suite, to compare his impressions with \nthose of others. They were all looking at the \nfield of battle as he was, and, as it seemed to \nhim, with the same feelings. All their faces \nwere now shining with that latent warmth of \nfeeling Pierre had noticed the day before and \nhad fully understood after his talk with Prince \nAndrew. \n\n"Go, my dear fellow, go ... and Christ be \nwith you I" Kutuzov was saying to a general \nwho stood beside him, not taking his eye from \nthe battlefield. \n\nHaving received this order the general \npassed by Pierre on his way down the knoll. \n\n"To the crossing!" said the general coldly \nand sternly in reply to one of the staff who \nasked where he was going. \n\n'Til go there too, I tool" thought Pierre, and \nfollowed the general. \n\nThe general mounted a horse a Cossack had \nbrought him. Pierre went to his groom who \n\n\n\nwas holding his horses and, asking which was \nthe quietest, clambered onto it, seized it by \nthe mane, and turning out his toes pressed his \nheels against its sides and, feeling that his \nspectacles were slipping off but unable to let \ngo of the mane and reins, he galloped after the \ngeneral, causing the staff officers to imile as \nthey watched him from the knoll. \n\nCHAPTER XXXI \n\nHAVING DESCENDED the hill the general after \nwhom Pierre was galloping turned sharply to \nthe left, and Pierre, losing sight of him, gal- \nloped in among some ranks of infantry march- \ning ahead of him. He tried to pass either in \nfront of them or to the right or left, but there \nwere soldiers everywhere, all with the same pre- \noccupied expression and busy with some un- \nseen but evidently important task. They all \ngazed with the same dissatisfied and inquir- \ning expression at this stout man in a white hat, \nwho for some unknown reason threatened to \ntrample them under his horse's hoofs. \n\n"Why ride into the middle of the battalion?" \none of them shouted at him. \n\nAnother prodded his horse with the butt \nend of a musket, and Pierre, bending over his \nsaddlebow and hardly able to control his shy- \ning horse, galloped ahead of the soldiers where \nthere was a free space. \n\nThere was a bridge ahead of him, where oth- \ner soldiers stood firing. Pierre rode up to them. \nWithout being aware of it he had come to the \nbridge across the Kolochd between G6rki and \nBorodin6, which the French (having occupied \nBorodin6) were attacking in the first phase of \nthe battle. Pierre saw that there was a bridge \nin front of him and that soldiers were doing \nsomething on both sides of it and in the mead- \now, among the rows of new-mown hay which \nhe had taken no notice of amid the smoke of \nthe campfires the day before; but despite the \nincessant firing going on there he had no idea \nthat this was the field of battle. He did not no- \ntice the sound of the bullets whistling from \nevery side, or the projectiles that flew over \nhim, did not see the enemy on the other side \nof the river, and for a long time did not notice \nthe killed and wounded, though many fell near \nhim. He looked about him with a smile which \ndid not leave his face. \n\n"Why's that fellow in front of the line?" \nshouted somebody at him again. \n\n"To the leftl . . . Keep to the right!" the men \nshouted to him. \n\nPierre went to the right, and unexpectedly \n\n\n\n45* \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nencountered one of Ra^vski's adjutants whom \nhe knew. The adjutant looked angrily at him, \nevidently also intending to shout at him, but \non recognizing him he nodded. \n\n"How have you got here?" he said, and gal- \nloped on. \n\nPierre, feeling out of place there, having \nnothing to do, and afraid of getting in some- \none's way again, galloped after the adjutant. \n\n"What's happening here? May I come with \nyou?" he asked. \n\n"One moment, one moment!" replied the \nadjutant, and riding up to a stout colonel who \nwas standing in the meadow, he gave him some \nmessage and then addressed Pierre. \n\n"Why have you come here, Count?" he asked \nwith a smile. "Still inquisitive?" \n\n"Yes, yes," assented Pierre. \n\nBut the adjutant turned his horse about and \nrode on. \n\n"Here it's tolerable," said he, "but with Ba- \ngrati6n on the left flank they're getting it \nfrightfully hot." \n\n"Really?" said Pierre. "Where is that?" \n\n"Come along with me to our knoll. We can \nget a view from there and in our battery it is \nstill bearable," said the adjutant. "Will you \ncome?" \n\n"Yes, I'll come with you," replied Pierre, \nlooking round for his groom. \n\nIt was only now that he noticed wounded \nmen staggering along or being carried on \nstretchers. On that very meadow he had rid- \nden over the day before, a soldier was lying \nathwart the rows of scented hay, with his head \nthrown awkwardly back and his shako off. \n\n"Why haven't they carried him away?" Pierre \nwas about to ask, but seeing the stern expres- \nsion of the adjutant who was also looking that \nway, he checked himself. \n\nPierre did not find his groom and rode \nalong the hollow with the adjutant to RacV \nski's Redoubt. His horse lagged behind the ad- \njutant's and jolted him at every step. \n\n"You don't seem to be used to riding, \nCount?" remarked the adjutant. \n\n"No, it's not that, but her action seems so \njerky," said Pierre in a puzzled tone. \n\n"Why . . . she's wounded!" said the adju- \ntant. "In the off foreleg above the knee. A bul- \nlet, no doubt. I congratulate you, Count, on \nyour baptism of fire!" \n\nHaving ridden in the smoke past the Sixth \nCorps, behind the artillery which had been \nmoved forward and was in action, deafening \nthem with the noise of firing, they came to a \n\n\n\nsmall wood. There it was cool and quiet, with \na scent of autumn. Pierre and the adjutant dis- \nmounted and walked up the hill on foot. \n\n"Is the general here?" asked the adjutant \non reaching the knoll. \n\n"He was here a minute ago but has just gone \nthat way," someone told him, pointing to the \nright. \n\nThe adjutant looked at Pierre as if puzzled \nwhat to do with him now. \n\n"Don't trouble about me," said Pierre. "I'll \ngo up onto the knoll if I may?" \n\n"Yes, do. You'll see everything from there \nand it's less dangerous, and I'll come for you." \n\nPierre went to the battery and the adjutant \nrode on. They did not meet again, and only \nmuch later did Pierre learn that he lost an arm \nthat day. \n\nThe knoll to which Pierre ascended was that \nfamous one afterwards known to the Russians \nas the Knoll Battery or RacH'ski's Redoubt, \nand to the French as la grande redoute, la fa- \ntale redoute, la redoute du centre, around \nwhich tens of thousands fell, and which the \nFrench regarded as the key to the whole po- \nsition. \n\nThis redoubt consisted of a knoll, on three \nsides of which trenches had been dug. Within \nthe entrenchment stood ten guns that were \nbeing fired through openings in the earth- \nwork. \n\nIn line with the knoll on both sides stood \nother guns which also fired incessantly. A little \nbehind the guns stood infantry. When ascend- \ning that knoll Pierre had no notion that this \nspot, on which small trenches had been dug \nand from which a few guns were firing, was \nthe most important point of the battle. \n\nOn the contrary, just because he happened \nto be there he thought it one of the least sig- \nnificant parts of the field. \n\nHaving reached the knoll, Pierre sat down \nat one end of a trench surrounding the battery \nand gazed at what was going on around him \nwith an unconsciously happy smile. Occasion- \nally he rose and walked about the battery still \nwith that same smile, trying not to obstruct \nthe soldiers who were loading, hauling the \nguns, and continually running past him with \nbags and charges. The guns of that battery were \nbeing fired continually one after another with \na deafening roar, enveloping the whole neigh- \nborhood in powder smoke. \n\nIn contrast with the dread felt by the in- \nfantrymen placed in support, here in the bat- \ntery where a small number of men busy at their \n\n\n\nBOOK \n\nwork were separated from the rest by a trench, \neveryone experienced a common and as it were \nfamily feeling of animation. \n\nThe intrusion of Pierre's nonmilitary figure \nin a white hat made an unpleasant impression \nat first. The soldiers looked askance at him with \nsurprise and even alarm as they went past him. \nThe senior artillery officer, a tall, long-legged, \npockmarked man, moved over to Pierre as if \nto see the action of the farthest gun and looked \nat him with curiosity. \n\nA young round-faced officer, quite a boy still \nand evidently only just out of the Cadet Col- \nlege, who was zealously commanding the two \nguns entrusted to him, addressed Pierre sternly. \n\n"Sir," he said, "permit me to ask you to \nstand aside. You must not be here." \n\nThe soldiers shook their heads disapprov- \ningly as they looked at Pierre. But when they \nhad convinced themselves that this man in the \nwhite hat was doing no harm, but either sat \nquietly on the slope of the trench with a shy \nsmile or, politely making way for the soldiers, \npaced up and down the battery under fire as \ncalmly as if he were on a boulevard, their feel- \ning of hostile distrust gradually began to \nchange into a kindly and bantering sympathy, \nsuch as soldiers feel for their dogs, cocks, goats, \nand in general for the animals that live with \nthe regiment. The men soon accepted Pierre \ninto their family, adopted him, gave him a \nnickname ("our gentleman"), and made kind- \nly fun of him among themselves. \n\nA shell tore up the earth two paces from Pi- \nerre and he looked around with a smile as he \nbrushed from his clothes some earth it had \nthrown up. \n\n"And how's it you're not afraid, sir, really \nnow?" a red-faced, broad-shouldered soldier \nasked Pierre, with a grin that disclosed a set \nof sound, white teeth. \n\n"Are you afraid, then?" said Pierre. \n\n"What else do you expect?" answered the \nsoldier. "She has no mercy, you know! When \nshe comes spluttering down, out go your in- \nnards. One can't help being afraid," he said \nlaughing. \n\nSeveral of the men, with bright kindly faces, \nstopped beside Pierre. They seemed not to have \nexpected him to talk like anybody else, and the \ndiscovery that he did so delighted them. \n\n"It's the business of us soldiers. But in a \ngentleman it's wonderful! There's a gentle- \nman for you I" \n\n"To your places!" cried the young officer to \nthe men gathered round Pierre. \n\n\n\nTEN 453 \n\nThe young officer was evidently exercising \nhis duties for the first or second time and \ntherefore treated both his superiors and the \nmen with great precision and formality. \n\nThe booming cannonade and the fusillade \nof musketry were growing more intense over \nthe whole field, especially to the left where Ba- \ngrati6n's fleches were, but where Pierre was \nthe smoke of the firing made it almost im- \npossible to distinguish anything. Moreover, \nhis whole attention was engrossed by watch- \ning the family circle separated from all else \nformed by the men in the battery. His first \nunconscious feeling of joyful animation pro- \nduced by the sights and sounds of the battle- \nfield was now replaced by another, especially \nsince he had seen that soldier lying alone in \nthe hayfield. Now, seated on the slope of the \ntrench, he observed the faces of those around \nhim. \n\nBy ten o'clock some twenty men had already \nbeen carried away from the battery; two guns \nwere smashed and cannon balls fell more and \nmore frequently on the battery and spent \nbullets buzzed and whistled around. But the \nmen in the battery seemed not to notice this, \nand merry voices and jokes were heard on all \nsides. \n\n"A live one!" shouted a man as a whistling \nshell approached. \n\n"Not this wayl To the infantry!" added an- \nother with loud laughter, seeing the shell fly \npast and fall into the ranks of the supports. \n\n"Are you bowing to a friend, eh?" remarked \nanother, chaffing a peasant who ducked low \nas a cannon ball flew over. \n\nSeveral soldiers gathered by the wall of the \ntrench, looking out to see what was happen- \ning in front. \n\n"They've withdrawn the front line, it has \nretired," said they, pointing over the earth- \nwork. \n\n"Mind your own business," an old sergeant \nshouted at them. "If they've retired it's because \nthere's work for them to do farther back." \n\nAnd the sergeant, taking one of the men by \nthe shoulders, gave him a shove with his knee. \nThis was followed by a burst of laughter. \n\n"To the fifth gun, wheel it up!" came shouts \nfrom one side. \n\n"Now then, all together, like bargees!" rose \nthe merry voices of those who were moving the \ngun. \n\n"Oh, she nearly knocked our gentleman's hat \noff!" cried the red-faced humorist, showing his \nteeth and chaffing Pierre. "Awkward baggage!" \n\n\n\n454 WAR AND PEACE \n\nhe added reproachfully to a cannon ball that \nstruck a cannon wheel and a man's leg. \n\n"Now then, you foxes!" said another, laugh- \ning at some militiamen who, stooping low, en- \ntered the battery to carry away the wounded \nman. \n\n"So this gruel isn't to your taste? Oh, you \ncrows! You're scared!" they shouted at the mi- \nlitiamen who stood hesitating before the man \nwhose leg had been torn off. \n\n"There, lads . . . oh, oh!" they mimicked the \npeasants, "they don't like it at all!" \n\nPierre noticed that after every ball that hit \nthe redoubt, and after every loss, the liveliness \nincreased more and more. \n\nAs the flames of the fire hidden within come \nmore and more vividly and rapidly from an \napproaching thundercloud, so, as if in opposi- \ntion to what was taking place, the lightning of \nhidden fire growing more and more intense \nglowed in the faces of these men. \n\nPierre did not look out at the battlefield and \nwas not concerned to know what was happen- \ning there; he was entirely absorbed in watch- \ning this fire which burned ever more brightly \nand which he felt was flaming up in the same \nway in his own soul. \n\nAt ten o'clock the infantry that had been \namong the bushes in front of the battery and \nalong the Kdmenka streamlet retreated. From \nthe battery they could be seen running back \npast it carrying their wounded on their mus- \nkets. A general with his suite came to the bat- \ntery, and after speaking to the colonel gave \nPierre an angry look and went away again \nhaving ordered the infantry supports behind \nthe battery to lie down, so as to be less ex- \nposed to fire. After this from amid the ranks \nof infantry to the right of the battery came the \nsound of a drum and shouts of command, and \nfrom the battery one saw how those ranks of \ninfantry moved forward. \n\nPierre looked over the wall of the trench and \nwas particularly struck by a pale young officer \nwho, letting his sword hang down, was walking \nbackwards and kept glancing uneasily around. \n\nThe ranks of the infantry disappeared amid \nthe smoke but their long-drawn shout and rap- \nid musketry firing could still be heard. A few \nminutes later crowds of wounded men and \nstretcher-bearers came back from that direction. \nProjectiles began to fall still more frequently \nin the battery. Several men were lying about \nwho had not been removed. Around the cannon \nthe men moved still more briskly and busily. No \none any longer took notice of Pierre. Once or \n\n\n\ntwice he was shouted at for being in the way. \nThe senior officer moved with big, rapid strides \nfrom one gun to another with a frowning face. \nThe young officer, with his face still more \nflushed, commanded the men more scrupulous- \nly than ever. The soldiers handed up the \ncharges, turned, loaded, and did their business \nwith strained smartness. They gave little jumps \nas they walked, as though they were on springs. \n\nThe storrncloud had come upon them, and \nin every face the fire which Pierre had watched \nkindle burned up brightly. Pierre was standing \nbeside the commanding officer. The young offi- \ncer, his hand to his shako, ran up to his su- \nperior. \n\n"I have the honor to report, sir, that only \neight rounds are left. Are we to continue fir- \ning?" he asked. \n\n"Grapcshot!" the senior shouted, without \nanswering the question, looking over the wall \nof the trench. \n\nSuddenly something happened: the young \nofficer gave a gasp and benclingdouble sat down \non the ground like a bird shot on the wing. \nEverything became strange, confused, and \nmisty in Pierre's eyes. \n\nOne cannon ball after another whistled by \nand struck the earthwork, a soldier, or a gun. \nPierre, who had not noticed these sounds be- \nfore, now heard nothing else. On the right of \nthe battery soldiers shouting "Hurrah!" were \nrunning not forwards but backwards, it seemed \nto Pierre. \n\nA cannon ball struck the very end of the \nearthwork by which he was standing, crumbling \ndown the earth; a black ball flashed before his \neyes and at the same instant plumped into \nsomething. Some militiamen who were enter- \ning the battery ran back. \n\n"All with grapeshotl" shouted the officer. \n\nThe sergeant ran up to the officer and in a \nfrightened whisper informed him (as a butler \nat dinner informs his master that there is no \nmore of some wine asked for) that there were \nno more charges. \n\n"The scoundrels! What are they doing?" \nshouted the officer, turning to Pierre. \n\nThe officer's face was red and perspiring and \nhis eyes glittered under his frowning brow. \n\n"Run to the reserves and bring up the am- \nmunition boxes!" he yelled, angrily avoiding \nPierre with his eyes and speaking to his men. \n\n"I'll go," said Pierre. \n\nThe officer, without answering him, strode \nacross to the opposite side. \n\n"Don't fire Wait!" he shouted. \n\n\n\nBOOK TEN \n\n\n\n455 \n\n\n\nThe man who had been ordered to go for \nammunition stumbled against Pierre. \n\n"Eh, sir, this is no place for you," said he, \nand ran down the slope. \n\nPierre ran after him, avoiding the spot where \nthe young officer was sitting. \n\nOne cannon ball, another, and a third flew \nover him, falling in front, beside, and behind \nhim. Pierre ran down the slope. "Where am I \ngoing?" he suddenly asked himself when he \nwas already near the green ammunition wag- \nons. He halted irresolutely, not knowing \nwhether to return or go on. Suddenly a terrible \nconcussion threw him back wards to the ground. \nAt the same instant he was da/zled by a great \nflash of flame, and immediately a deafening \nroar, crackling, and whistling made his ears \ntingle. \n\nWhen he came to himself he was sitting on \nthe ground leaning on his hands; the ammu- \nnition wagons he had been approaching no \nlonger existed, only charred green boards and \nrags littered the scorched grass, and a horse, \ndangling fragments of its shaft behind it, gal- \nloped past, while another horse lay, like Pi- \nerre, on the ground, uttering prolonged and \npiercing cries. \n\nCHAPTER XXXII \n\nBESIDE HIMSELF with terror Pierre jumped up \nand ran back to the battery, as to the only ref- \nuge from the horrors that surrounded him. \n\nOn entering the earthwork he noticed that \nthere were men doing something there but that \nno shots were being fired from the battery. He \nhad no time to realize who these men were. He \nsaw the senior officer lying on the earth wall \nwith his back turned as if he were examining \nsomething down below and that one of the sol- \ndiers he had noticed before was struggling for- \nward shouting "Brothers!" and trying to free \nhimself from some men who were holding him \nby the arm. He also saw something else that \nwas strange. \n\nBut he had not time to realize that the colo- \nnel had been killed, that the soldier shouting \n"Brothers!" was a prisoner, and that another \nman had been bayoneted in the back before \nhis eyes, for hardly had he run into the re- \ndoubt before a thin, sallow-faced, perspiring \nman in a blue uniform rushed on him sword \nin hand, shouting something. Instinctively \nguarding against the shockfor they had been \nrunning together at full speed before they saw \none another Pierre put out his hands and \nseized the man (a French officer) by the shoul- \n\n\n\nder with one hand and by the throat with the \nother. The officer, dropping his sword, seized \nPierre by his collar. \n\nFor some seconds they gazed with frightened \neyes at one another's unfamiliar faces and both \nwere perplexed at what they had done and \nwhat they were to do next. "Am I taken pris- \noner or have I taken him prisoner?" each was \nthinking. But the French officer was evidently \nmore inclined to think he had been taken pris- \noner because Pierre's strong hand, impelled by \ninstinctive fear, squeezed his throat ever tight- \ner and tighter. The Frenchman was about to \nsay something, when just above their heads, \nterrible and low, a cannon ball whistled, and \nit seemed to Pierre that the French officer's \nhead had been torn off, so swiftly had he \nducked it. \n\nPierre too bent his head and let his hands \nfall. Without further thought as to who had \ntaken whom prisoner, the Frenchman ran back \nto the battery and Pierre ran down the slope \nstumbling over the dead and wounded who, it \nseemed to him, caught at his feet. But before \nhe reached the foot of the knoll he was met by \na dense crowd of Russian soldiers who, stum- \nbling, tripping up, and shouting, ran merrily \nand wildly toward the battery. (This was the \nattack for which Erm61ov claimed the credit, \ndeclaring that only his courage and good luck \nmade such a feat possible: it was the attack in \nwhich he was said to have thrown some St. \nGeorge's Crosses he had in his pocket into the \nbattery for the first soldiers to take who got \nthere.) \n\nThe French who had occupied the battery \nfled, and our troops shouting "Hurrah!" pur- \nsued them so far beyond the battery that it was \ndifficult to call them back. \n\nThe prisoners were brought down from the \nbattery and among them was a wounded French \ngeneral, whom the officers surrounded. Crowds \nof wounded some known to Pierre and some \nunknown Russians and French, with faces \ndistorted by suffering, walked, crawled, and \nwere carried on stretchers from the battery. \nPierre again went up onto the knoll where he \nhad spent over an hour, and of that family \ncircle which had received him as a member he \ndid not find a single one. There were many \ndead whom he did not know, but some he rec- \nognized. The young officer still sat in the same \nway, bent double, in a pool of blood at the \nedge of the earth wall. The red-faced man was \nstill twitching, but they did not carry him \naway. \n\n\n\n456 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nPierre ran down the slope once more. \n\n"Now they will stop it, now they will be hor- \nrified at what they have donel" he thought, \naimlessly going toward a crowd of stretcher- \nbearers moving from the battlefield. \n\nBut behind the veil of smoke the sun was \nstill high, and in front and especially to the \nleft, near Semenovsk, something seemed to be \nseething in the smoke, and the roar of cannon \nand musketry did not diminish, but even in- \ncreased to desperation like a man who, strain- \ning himself, shrieks with all his remaining \nstrength. \n\nCHAPTER XXXIII \n\nTHE CHIEF ACTION of the battle of Borodin6 \nwas fought within the seven thousand feet be- \ntween Borodin6 and Bagrati6n's fleches. Be- \nyond that space there was, on the one side, a \ndemonstration made by the Russians with \nUvdrov's cavalry at midday, and on the other \nside, beyond Utitsa, Poniatowski's collision \nwith Tuchk6v; but these two were detached \nand feeble actions in comparison with what \ntook place in the center of the battlefield. On \nthe field between Borodin6 and the fleches, be- \nside the wood, the chief action of the day took \nplace on an open space visible from both sides \nand was fought in the simplest and most art- \nless way. \n\nThe battle began on both sides with a can- \nnonade from several hundred guns. \n\nThen when the whole field was covered with \nsmoke, two divisions, Campan's and Dessaix's, \nadvanced from the French right, while Murat's \ntroops advanced on Borodino from their left. \n\nFrom the Shevdrdino Redoubt where Napo- \nleon was standing the fleches were two thirds \nof a mile away, and it was more than a mile as \nthe crow flies to Borodin6, so that Napoleon \ncould not see what was happening there, es- \npecially as the smoke mingling with the mist \nhid the whole locality. The soldiers of Dessaix's \ndivision advancing against the fleches could \nonly be seen till they had entered the hollow \nthat lay between them and the fleches. As soon \nas they had descended into that hollow, the \nsmoke of the guns and musketry on the fleches \ngrew so dense that it covered the whole ap- \nproach on that side of it. Through the smoke \nglimpses could be caught of something black \nprobably menand at times the glint of \nbayonets. But whether they were moving or \nstationary, whether they were French or Rus- \nsian, could not be discovered from the Shevar- \ndino Redoubt. \n\n\n\nThe sun had risen brightly and its slanting \nrays struck straight into Napoleon's face as, \nshading his eyes with his hand, he looked at \nthe fleches.The smoke spread out before them, \nand at times it looked as if the smoke were \nmoving, at times as if the troops moved. Some- \ntimes shouts were heard through the firing, \nbut it was impossible to tell what was being \ndone there. \n\nNapoleon, standing on the. knoll, looked \nthrough a field glass, and in its small circlet \nsaw smoke and men, sometimes his own and \nsometimes Russians, but when he looked \nagain with the naked eye, he could not tell \nwhere what he had seen was. \n\nHe descended the knoll and began walking \nup and down before it. \n\nOccasionally he stopped, listened to the fir- \ning, and gazed intently at the battlefield. \n\nBut not only was it impossible to make out \nwhat was happening from where he was stand- \ning down below, or from the knoll above on \nwhich some of his generals had taken their \nstand, but even from the fleches themselves \nin which by this time there were now Russian \nand now French soldiers, alternately or to- \ngether, dead, wounded, alive, frightened, or \nmaddened even at those fleches themselves it \nwas impossible to make out what was taking \nplace. There for several hours amid incessant \ncannon and musketry fire, now Russians were \nseen alone, now Frenchmen alone, now in- \nfantry, and now cavalry: they appeared, fired, \nfell, collided, not knowing what to do with \none another, screamed, and ran back again. \n\nFrom the battlefield adjutants he had sent \nout, and orderlies from his marshals, kept \ngalloping up to Napoleon with reports of the \nprogress of the action, but all these reports \nwere false, both because it was impossible in \nthe heat of battle to say what was happening \nat any given moment and because many of the \nadjutants did not go to the actual place of \nconflict but reported what they had heard from \nothers; and also because while an adjutant was \nriding more than a mile to Napoleon circum- \nstances changed and the news he brought was \nalready becoming false. Thus an adjutant gal- \nloped up from Murat with tidings that Boro- \ndin6 had been occupied and the bridge over \nthe Kolochd was in the hands of the French. \nThe adjutant asked whether Napoleon wished \nthe troops to cross it? Napoleon gave orders \nthat the troops should form up on the farther \nside and wait. But before that order was given \nalmost as soon in fact as the adjutant had \n\n\n\nBOOK TEN \n\n\n\n457 \n\n\n\nleft Borodin6 the bridge had been retaken by \nthe Russians and burned, in the very skirmish \nat which Pierre had been present at the begin- \nning of the battle. \n\nAn adjutant galloped up from the fleches \nwith a pale and frightened face and reported \nto Napoleon that their attack had been re- \npulsed, Campan wounded, and Davout killed; \nyet at the very time the adjutant had been told \nthat the French had been repulsed, the fitches \nhad in fact been recaptured by other French \ntroops, and Davout was alive and only slightly \nbruised. On the basis of these necessarily un- \ntrustworthy reports Napoleon gave his orders, \nwhich had either been executed before he \ngave them or could not be and were not exe- \ncuted. \n\nThe marshals and generals, who were nearer \nto the field of battle but, like Napoleon, did \nnot take part in the actual fighting and only \noccasionally went within musket range, made \ntheir own arrangements without asking Napo- \nleon and issued orders where and in what di- \nrection to fire and where cavalry should gallop \nand infantry should run. But even theirorders, \nlike Napoleon's, were seldom carried out, and \nthen but partially. For the most part things \nhappened contrary to their orders. Soldiers \nordered to advance ran back on meetinggrape- \nshot; soldiers ordered to remain where they \nwere, suddenly, seeing Russians unexpectedly \nbefore them, sometimes rushed back and some- \ntimes forward, and the cavalry dashed without \norders in pursuit of the flying Russians. In this \nway two cavalry regiments galloped through \nthe Semenovsk hollow and as soon as they \nreached the top of the incline turned round \nand galloped full speed back again. The in- \nfantry moved in the same way, sometimes run- \nning to quite other places than those they \nwere ordered to go to. All orders as to where \nand when to move the guns, when to send in- \nfantry to shoot or horsemen to ride down the \nRussian infantry all such orders were given \nby the officers on the spot nearest to the units \nconcerned, without asking either Ney, Davout, \nor Murat, much less Napoleon. They did not \nfear getting into trouble for not fulfilling or- \nders or for acting on their own initiative, for \nin battle what is at stake is what is dearest to \nmanhis own life and it sometimes seems that \nsafety lies in running back, sometimes in run- \nning forward; and these men who were right \nin the heat of the battle acted according to the \nmood of the moment. In reality, however, all \nthese movements forward and backward did \n\n\n\nnot improve or alter the position of the troops. \nAll their rushing and galloping at one another \ndid little harm, the harm of disablement and \ndeath was caused by the balls and bullets that \nflew over the fields on which these men were \nfloundering about. As soon as they left the \nplace where the balls and bullets were flying \nabout, their superiors, located in the back- \nground, re-formed them and brought them \nunder discipline and under the influence of \nthat discipline led them back to the zone of \nfire, where under the influence of fear of death \nthey lost their discipline and rushed about ac- \ncording to the chance promptings of the throng. \n\nCHAPTER XXXIV \n\nNAPOLEON'S GENERALS Davout, Ney, and Mu- \nrat, who were near that region of fire and \nsometimes even entered it repeatedly led in- \nto it huge masses of well-ordered troops. But \ncontrary to what had always happened in their \nformer battles, instead of the news they ex- \npected of the enemy's flight, these orderly \nmasses returned thence as disorganized and \nterrified mobs. The generals re-formed them, \nbut their numbers constantly decreased. In the \nmiddle of the day Murat sent his adjutant to \nNapoleon to demand reinforcements. \n\nNapoleon sat at the foot of the knoll, drink- \ning punch, when Murat's adjutant galloped \nup with an assurance that the Russians would \nbe routed if His Majesty would let him have \nanother division. \n\n"Reinforcements?" said Napoleon in a tone \nof stern surprise, looking at the adjutant a \nhandsome lad with long black curls arranged \nlike Murat's own as though he did not under- \nstand his words. \n\n"Reinforcements!" thought Napoleon to \nhimself. "How can they need reinforcements \nwhen they already have half the army directed \nagainst a weak, unentrenched Russian wing?" \n\n"Tell the King of Naples," said he sternly, \n"that it is not noon yet, and I don't yet see my \nchessboard clearly. Go! ..." \n\nThe handsome boy adjutant with the long \nhair sighed deeply without removing his hand \nfrom his hat and galloped back to where men \nwere being slaughtered. \n\nNapoleon rose and having summoned Caul- \naincourt and Berthier began talking to them \nabout matters unconnected with the battle. \n\nIn the midst of this conversation, which was \nbeginning to interest Napoleon, Berthier's eyes \nturned to look at a general with a suite, who \nwas galloping toward the knoll on a lathering \n\n\n\n458 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nhorse. It was Belliard. Having dismounted he \nwent up to the Emperor with rapid strides and \nin a loud voice began boldly demonstrating \nthe necessity of sending reinforcements. He \nswore on his honor that the Russians were lost \nif the Emperor would give another division. \n\nNapoleon shrugged his shoulders and con- \ntinued to pace up and down without replying. \nBelliard began talking loudly and eagerly to \nthe generals of the suite around him. \n\n"You are very fiery, Belliard," said Napo- \nleon, when he again came up to the general. \n"In the heat of a battle it is easy to make a \nmistake. Go and have another look and then \ncome back to me." \n\nBefore Belliard was out of sight, a messenger \nfrom another part of the battlefield galloped \nup. \n\n"Now then, what do you want?" asked Na- \npoleon in the tone of a man irritated at being \ncontinually disturbed. \n\n"Sire, the prince . . ." began the adjutant. \n\n"Asks for reinforcements?" said Napoleon \nwith an angry gesture. \n\nThe adjutant bent his head affirmatively and \nbegan to report, but the Emperor turned from \nhim, took a couple of steps, stopped, came \nback, and called Berthier. \n\n"We must give reserves," he said, moving \nhis arms slightly apart. "Who do you think \nshould be sent there?" he asked of Berthier \n(whom he subsequently termed "that gosling \nI have made an eagle"). \n\n"Send ClaparMe's division, sire," replied \nBerthier, who knew all the divisions, regi- \nments, and battalions by heart. \n\nNapoleon nodded assent. \n\nThe adjutant galloped to Claparede's divi- \nsion and a few minutes later the Young Guards \nstationed behind the knoll moved forward. \nNapoleon gazed silently in that direction. \n\n"Nol" he suddenly said to Berthier. "I can't \nsend Clapar&amp;de. Send Friant's division." \n\nThough there was no advantage in sending \nFriant's division instead of CJapar&amp;de's, and \neven in obvious inconvenience and delay in \nstopping Claparede and sending Friant now, \nthe order was carried out exactly. Napoleon \ndid not notice that in regard to his army he \nwas playing the part of a doctor who hinders \nby his medicines a role he 10 justly under- \nstood and condemned. \n\nFriant's division disappeared as the others \nhad done into the smoke of the battlefield. \nFrom all sides adjutants continued to arrive at \na gallop and as if by agreement all said the \n\n\n\nsame thing. They all asked for reinforcements \nand all said that the Russians were holding their \npositions and maintaining a hellish fire under \nwhich the French army was melting away. \n\nNapoleon sat on a campstool, wrapped in \nthought. \n\nM. de Beausset, the man so fond of travel, \nhaving fasted since morning, came up to the \nEmperor and ventured respectfully to suggest \nlunch to His Majesty. \n\n"I hope I may now congratulate Your Maj- \nesty on a victory?" said he. \n\nNapoleon silently shook his head in nega- \ntion. Assuming the negation to refer only to \nthe victory and not to the lunch, M. de Beaus- \nset ventured with respectful jocularity to re- \nmark that there is no reason for not having \nlunch when one can get it. \n\n"Go away . . ." exclaimed Napoleon sudden- \nly and morosely, and turned aside. \n\nA beatific smile of regret, repentance, and \necstasy beamed on M. de Beausset's face and \nhe glided away to the other generals. \n\nNapoleon was experiencing a feeling of de- \npression like that of an ever-lucky gambler \nwho, after recklessly flinging money about and \nalways winning, suddenly just when he has \ncalculated all the chances of the game, finds \nthat the more he considers his play the more \nsurely he loses. \n\nHis troops were the same, his generals the \nsame, the same preparations had been made, \nthe same dispositions, and the same proclama- \ntion courte et tnergique, he himself was still \nthe same: he knew that and knew that he was \nnow even more experienced and skillful than \nbefore. Even the enemy was the same as at \nAusterlitz and Friedland yet the terrible stroke \nof his arm had supernaturally become impo- \ntent. \n\nAll the old methods that had been unfail- \ningly crowned with success: the concentration \nof batteries on one point, an attack by reserves \nto break the enemy's line, and a cavalry attack \nby "the men of iron," all these methods had \nalready been employed, yet not only was there \nno victory, but from all sides came the same \nnews of generals killed and wounded, of rein- \nforcements needed, of the impossibility of driv- \ning back the Russians, and of disorganization \namong his own troops. \n\nFormerly, after he had given two or three \norders and uttered a few phrases, marshals and \nadjutants had come galloping up with con- \ngratulations and happy faces, announcing the \ntrophies taken, the corps of prisoners, bundles \n\n\n\nBOOK TEN \n\n\n\n459 \n\n\n\nof enemy eagles and standards, cannon and \nstores, and Murat had only begged leave to \nloose the cavalry to gather in the baggage \nwagons. So it had been at Lodi, Marengo, Ar- \ncola, Jena, Austerlitz, Wagram, and so on. \nBut now something strange was happening to \nhis troops. \n\nDespite news of the capture of the fitches, \nNapoleon saw that this was not the same, not \nat all the same, as what had happened in his \nformer battles. He saw that what he was feel- \ning was felt by all the men about him experi- \nenced in the art of war. All their faces looked \ndejected, and they all shunned one another's \neyes only a de Beausset could fail to grasp the \nmeaning of what was happening. \n\nBut Napoleon with hts long experience of \nwar well knew the meaning of a battle not \ngained by the attacking side in eight hours, \nafter all efforts had been expended. He knew \nthat it was a lost battle and that the least acci- \ndent might now with the fight balanced on \nsuch a strained center destroy him and his \narmy. \n\nWhen he ran his mind over the whole of \nthis strange Russian campaign in which not \none battle had been won, and in which not a \nflag, or cannon, or army corps had been cap- \ntured in two months, when he looked at the \nconcealed depression on the faces around him \nand heard reports of the Russians still holding \ntheir ground a terrible feeling like a night- \nmare took possession of him, and all the un- \nlucky accidents that might destroy him oc- \ncurred to his mind. The Russians might fall \non his left wing, might break through his cen- \nter, he himself might be killed by a stray can- \nnon ball. All this was possible. In former \nbattles he had only considered the possibilities \nof success, but now innumerable unlucky \nchances presented themselves, and he expected \nthem all. Yes, it was like a dream in which a \nman fancies that a ruffian is coming to attack \nhim, and raises his arm to strike that ruffian a \nterrible blow which he knows should annihi- \nlate him, but then feels that his arm drops \npowerless and limp like a rag, and the horror \nof unavoidable destruction seizes him in his \nhelplessness. \n\nThe news that the Russians were attacking \nthe left flank of the French army aroused that \nhorror in Napoleon. He sat silently on a camp- \nstool below the knoll, with head bowed and \nelbows on his knees. Berthier approached and \nsuggested that they should ride along the line \nto ascertain the position of affairs. \n\n\n\n"What? What do you say?" asked Napoleon. \n"Yes, tell them to bring me my horse." \n\nHe mounted and rode toward Semenovsk. \n\nAmid the powder smoke, slowly dispersing \nover the whole space through which Napoleon \nrode, horses and men were lying in pools of \nblood, singly or in heaps. Neither Napoleon \nnor any of his generals had ever before seen \nsuch horrors or so many slain in such a small \narea. The roar of guns, that had not ceased for \nten hours, wearied the ear and gave a peculiar \nsignificance to the spectacle, as music does to \ntableaux vivants. Napoleon rode up the high \nground at Semenovsk, and through the smoke \nsaw ranks of men in uniforms of a color un- \nfamiliar to him. They were Russians. \n\nThe Russians stood in serried ranks behind \nSemenovsk village and its knoll, and their guns \nboomed incessantly along their line and sent \nforth clouds of smoke. It was no longer a bat- \ntle: it was a continuous slaughter which could \nbe of no avail either to the French or the Rus- \nsians. Napoleon stopped his horse and again \nfell into the reverie from which Berthier had \naroused him. He could not stop what was go- \ning on before him and around him and was \nsupposed to be directed by him and to depend \non him, and from its lack of success this affair, \nfor the first time, seemed to him unnecessary \nand horrible. \n\nOne of the generals rode up to Napoleon \nand ventured to offer to lead the Old Guard \ninto action. Ney and Berthier, standing near \nNapoleon, exchanged looks and smiled con- \ntemptuously at this general's senseless offer. \n\nNapoleon bowed his head and remained si- \nlent a long time. \n\n"At eight hundred leagues from France, I \nwill not have my Guard destroyed 1" he said, \nand turning his horse rode back toShevdrdino. \n\nCHAPTER XXXV \n\nON THE RUG-COVERED BENCH where Pierre had \nseen him in the morning sat Kutuzov, his gray \nhead hanging, his heavy body relaxed. He \ngave no orders, but only assented to or dis- \nsented from what others suggested. \n\n"Yes, yes, do that," he replied to various \nproposals. "Yes, yes: go, dear boy, and have a \nlook," he would say to one or another of those \nabout him; or, "No, don't, we'd better wait!" \nHe listened to the reports that were brought \nhim and gave directions when his subordinates \ndemanded that of him; but when listening to \nthe reports it seemed as if he were not inter- \nested in the import of the words spoken, but \n\n\n\n460 \n\nrather in something elsein the expression of \nface and tone of voice of those who were re- \nporting. By long years of military experience \nhe knew, and with the wisdom of age under- \nstood, that it is impossible for one man to \ndirect hundreds of thousands of others strug- \ngling with death, and he knew that the result \nof a battle is decided not by the orders of a \ncommander in chief, nor the place where the \ntroops are stationed, nor by the number of \ncannon or of slaughtered men, but by that in- \ntangible force called the spirit of the army, \nand he watched this force and guided it in as \nfar as that was in his power. \n\nKutiizov's general expression was one of \nconcentrated quiet attention, and his face wore \na strained look as if he found it difficult to \nmaster the fatigue of his old and feeble body. \n\nAt eleven o'clock they brought him news \nthat the (leches captured by the French had \nbeen retaken, but that Prince Bagration was \nwounded. Kutiizov groaned and swayed his \nhead. \n\n"Ride over to Prince Peter Ivanovich and \nfind out about it exactly/' he said to one of his \nadjutants, and then turned to the Duke of \nWurttemberg who was standing behind him. \n\n"Will Your Highness please take command \nof the first army?" \n\nSoon after the duke's departure before he \ncould possibly have reached Semenovsk his \nadjutant came back from him and told Kutii- \nzov that the duke asked for more troops. \n\nKutuzov made a grimace and sent an order \nto Dokhtiirov to take over the command of the \nfirst army, and a request to the duke whom he \nsaid he could not spare at such an important \nmoment to return to him. When they brought \nhim news that Murat had been taken prisoner, \nand the staff officers congratulated him, Ku- \ntuzov smiled. \n\n"Wait a little, gentlemen," said he. "The \nbattle is won, and there is nothing extraordi- \nnary in the capture of Murat. Still, it is better \nto wait before we rejoice." \n\nBut he sent an adjutant to take the news \nround the army. \n\nWhen Scherbinin came galloping from the \nleft flank with news that the French had cap- \ntured the fleches and the village of Semenovsk, \nKutiizov, guessing by the sounds of the battle \nand by Scherbinin's looks that the news was \nbad, rose as if to stretch his legs and, taking \nScherbinin's arm, led him aside. \n\n"Go, my dear fellow," he said to Erm61ov, \n"and see whether something can't be done." \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\nKutuzov was in G6rki, near the center of the \nRussian position. The attack directed by Na- \npoleon against our left flank had been several \ntimes repulsed. In the center the French had \nnot got beyond Borodin6, and on their left \nflank Uvarov's cavalry had put the French to \nflight. \n\nToward three o'clock the French attacks \nceased. On the faces of all who came from the \nfield of battle, and of those who stood around \nhim, Kutuzov noticed an expression of extreme \ntension. He was satisfied with the day's success \na success exceeding his expectations, but the \nold man's strength was failing him. Several \ntimes his head dropped low as if it were falling \nand he dozed off. Dinner was brought him. \n\nAdjutant General Wolzogen, the man who \nwhen riding past Prince Andrew had said, \n"the war should be extended widely," and \nwhom Bagrati6n so detested, rode up while Ku- \ntiizov was at dinner. Wolzogen had come from \nBarclay de Tolly to report on the progress of \naffairs on the left flank. The sagacious Barclay \nde Tolly, seeing crowds of wounded men run- \nning back and the disordered rear of the army, \nweighed all the circumstances, concluded that \nthe battle was lost, and sent his favorite officer \nto the commander in chief with that news. \n\nKutuzov was chew ing a piece of roast chicken \nwith difficulty and glanced at Wolzogen with \neyes that brightened under their puckering \nlids. \n\nWolzogen, nonchalantly stretching his legs, \napproached Kutuzov with a half-contemptu- \nous smile on his lips, scarcely touching the \npeak of his cap. \n\nHe treated his Serene Highness with a some- \nwhat affected nonchalance intended to show \nthat, as a highly trained military man, he left \nit to Russians to make an idol of this useless \nold man, but that he knew whom he was deal- \ning with. "Der alte Herr" (as in their own set \nthe Germans called Kutuzov) "is making him- \nself very comfortable," thought Wolzogen, and \nlooking severely at the dishes in front of Ku- \ntuzov he began to report to "the old gentle- \nman" the position of affairs on the left flank \nas Barclay had ordered him to and as he him- \nself had seen and understood it. \n\n"All the points of our position are in the \nenemy's hands and we cannot dislodge them \nfor lack of troops, the men are running away \nand it is impossible to stop them," he re- \nported. \n\nKutuzov ceased chewing and fixed an aston- \nished gaze on Wolzogen, as if not understand \n\n\n\ning what was said to him. Wolzogen, noticing \n"the old gentleman's" agitation, said with a \nsmile: \n\n"I have not considered it right to conceal \nfrom your Serene Highness what I have seen. \nThe troops are in complete disorder. . . ." \n\n"You have seen? You have seen? . . ." Kutii- \nzov shouted frowning, and rising quickly he \nwent up to Wolzogen. \n\n"How . . . how dare you! . . ." he shouted, \nchoking and making a threatening gesture \nwith his trembling arms: "How dare you, sir, \nsay that to me? You know nothing about it. \nTell General Barclay from me that his infor- \nmation is incorrect and that the real course of \nthe battle is better known to me, the com- \nmander in chief, than to him." \n\nWolzogen was about to make a rejoinder, \nbut Kutuzov interrupted him. \n\n"The enemy has been repulsed on the left \nand defeated on the right flank. If you have \nseen amiss, sir, do not allow yourself to say \nwhat you don't know! Be so good as to ride to \nGeneral Barclay and inform him of my firm \nintention to attack the enemy tomorrow," said \nKutuzov sternly. \n\nAll were silent, and the only sound audible \nwas the heavy breathing of the panting old \ngeneral. \n\n"They are repulsed everywhere, for which I \nthank God and our brave army! The enemy is \nbeaten, and tomorrow we shall drive him from \nthe sacred soil of Russia," said Kutuzov cross- \ning himself, and he suddenly sobbed as his \neyes filled with tears. \n\nWolzogen, shrugging his shoulders and curl- \ning his lips, stepped silently aside, marveling \nat "the old gentleman's" conceited stupidity. \n\n"Ah, here he is, my hero!" said Kutuzov to a \nportly, handsome, dark-haired general who \nwas just ascending the knoll. \n\nThis was Rae!vski, who had spent the whole \nday at the most important part of the field of \nBorodin6. \n\nRadvski reported that the troops were firmly \nholding their ground and that the French no \nlonger ventured to attack. \n\nAfter hearing him, Kutuzov said in French: \n\n"Then you do not think, like some others, \nthat we must retreat?" \n\n"On the contrary, your Highness, in inde- \ncisive actions it is always the most stubborn \nwho remain victors," replied Ra^vski, "and in \nmy opinion . . ." \n\n"Kaysdrovl" Kuttizov called to his adjutant. \n"Sit down and write out the order of the day \n\n\n\nBOOK TEN 461 \n\nfor tomorrow. And you," he continued, address- \n\n\n\ning another, "ride along the line and an- \nnounce that tomorrow we attack." \n\nWhile Kutuzov was talking to Ravski and \ndictating the order of the day, Wolzogen re- \nturned from Barclay and said that General \nBarclay wished to have written confirmation \nof the order the field marshal had given. \n\nKutuzov, without looking at Wolzogen, gave \ndirections ior the order to be written out \nwhich the former commander in chief, to avoid \npersonal responsibility, very judiciously wished \nto receive. \n\nAnd by means of that mysterious indefin- \nable bond which maintains throughout an \narmy one and the same temper, known as "the \nspirit of the army," and which constitutes the \nchief sinew of war, Kutuzov's words, his order \nfor a battle next day, immediately became \nknown from one end of the army to the other. \n\nIt was far from being the same woids or the \nsame order that reached the farthest links of \nthat chain. The tales passing from mouth to \nmouth at different ends of the army did not \neven resemble what Kutuzov had said, but the \nsense of his words spread everywhere because \nwhat he said was not the outcome of cunning \ncalculations, but of a feeling that lay in the \ncommander in chief's soul as in that of every \nRussian. \n\nAnd on learning that tomorrow they were to \nattack the enemy, and hearing from the high- \nest quarters a confirmation of what they wanted \nto believe, the exhausted, wavering men felt \ncomforted and inspirited. \n\nCHAPTER XXXVI \n\nPRINCE ANDREW'S REGIMENT was among the re- \nserves which till after one o'clock were stationed \ninactive behind Semenovsk, under heavy artil- \nlery fire. Toward two o'clock the regiment, \nhaving already lost more than two hundred \nmen, was moved forward into a trampled oat- \nfield in the gap between Semenovsk and the \nKnoll Battery, where thousands of men per- \nished that day and on which an intense, con- \ncentrated fire from several hundred enemy \nguns was directed between one and two \no'clock. \n\nWithout moving from that spot or firing a \nsingle shot the regiment here lost another \nthird of its men. From in front and especially \nfrom the right, in the unlifting smoke the \nguns boomed, and out of the mysterious do- \nmain of smoke that overlay the whole space \nin front, quick hissing cannon balls and slow \n\n\n\n462 \n\nwhistling shells flew unceasingly. At times, as \nif to allow them a respite, a quarter of an hour \npassed during which the cannon balls and \nshells all flew overhead, but sometimes several \nmen were torn from the regiment in a minute \nand the slain were continually being dragged \naway and the wounded carried off. \n\nWith each fresh blow less and less chance \nof life remained for those not yet killed. The \nregiment stood in columns of battalion, three \nhundred paces apart, but nevertheless the \nmen were always in one and the same mood. \nAll alike were taciturn and morose. Talk was \nrarely heard in the ranks, and it ceased alto- \ngether every time the thud of a successful shot \nand the cry of "stretchers!" was heard. Most of \nthe time, by their officers' order, the men sat \non the ground. One, having taken off his \nshako, carefully loosened the gathers of its lin- \ning and drew them tight again; another, rub- \nbing some dry clay between his palms, polished \nhis bayonet; another fingered the strap and \npulled the buckle of his bandolier, while an- \nother smoothed and refolded his leg bands \nand put his boots on again. Some built little \nhouses of the tufts in the plowed ground, or \nplaited baskets from the straw in the cornfield. \nAll seemed fully absorbed in these pursuits. \nWhen men were killed or wounded, when rows \nof stretchers went past, when some troops re- \ntreated, and when great masses of the enemy \ncame into view through the smoke, no one \npaid any attention to these things. But when \nour artillery or cavalry advanced or some of \nour infantry were seen to move forward, words \nof approval were heard on all sides. But the \nliveliest attention was attracted by occurrences \nquite apart from, and unconnected with, the \nbattle. It was as if the minds of these morally \nexhausted men found relief in everyday, com- \nmonplace occurrences. A battery of artillery \nwas passing in front of the regiment. The \nhorse of an ammunition cart put its leg over a \ntrace. "Hey, look at the trace horse 1 . . . Get \nher leg out! She'll fall. . . . Ah, they don't see \nit!" came identical shouts from the ranks all \nalong the regiment. Another time, general at- \ntention was attracted by a small brown dog, \ncoming heaven knows whence, which trotted \nin a preoccupied manner in front of the ranks \nwith tail stiffly erect till suddenly a shell fell \nclose by, when it yelped, tucked its tail be- \ntween its legs, and darted aside. Yells and \nshrieks of laughter rose from the whole regi- \nment. But such distractions lasted only a mo- \nment, and for eight hours the men had been \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\ninactive, without food, in constant fear of \n\n\n\ndeath, and their pale and gloomy faces grew \never paler and gloomier. \n\nPrince Andrew, pale and gloomy like every- \none in the regiment, paced up and down from \nthe border of one patch to another, at the edge \nof the meadow beside an oatfield, with head \nbowed and arms behind his back. There was \nnothing for him to do and no orders to be \ngiven. Everything went on of itself. The killed \nwere dragged from the front, the wounded \ncarried away, and the ranks closed up. If any \nsoldiers ran to the rear they returned immedi- \nately and hastily. At first Prince Andrew, con- \nsidering it his duty to rouse the courage of the \nmen and to set them an example, walked about \namong the ranks, but he soon became con- \nvinced that this was unnecessary and that there \nwas nothing he could teach them. All the pow- \ners of his soul, as of every soldier there, were \nunconsciously bent on avoiding the contem- \nplation of the horrors of their situation. He \nwalked along the meadow, dragging his feet, \nrustling the grass, and gazing at the dust that \ncovered his boots; now he took big strides try- \ning to keep to the footprints left on the mead- \now by the mowers, then he counted his steps, \ncalculating how often he must walk from one \nstrip to another to walk a mile, then he stripped \nthe flowers from the wormwood that grew a- \nlong a boundary rut, rubbed them in his palms, \nand smelled their pungent, sweetly bitter scent. \nNothing remained of the previous day's \nthoughts. He thought of nothing. He listened \nwith weary ears to the ever-recurring sounds, \ndistinguishing the whistle of flying projectiles \nfrom the booming of the reports, glanced at \nthe tiresomely familiar faces of the men of the \nfirst battalion, and waited. "Here it comes . . . \nthis one is coming our way again!" he thought, \nlistening to an approaching whistle in the hid- \nden region of smoke. "One, another! Again! \nIt has hit. . . ." He stopped and looked at the \nranks. "No, it has gone over. But this one has \nhit!" And again he started trying to reach the \nboundary strip in sixteen paces. A whizz and \na thud! Five paces from him, a cannon ball \ntore up the dry earth and disappeared. A chill \nran down his back. Again he glanced at the \nranks. Probably many had been hit a large \ncrowd had gathered near the second battalion. \n\n"Adjutant!" he shouted. "Order them not \nto crowd together." \n\nThe adjutant, having obeyed this instruc- \ntion, approached Prince Andrew. From the oth- \ner side a battalion commander rode up. \n\n\n\nBOOK TEN \n\n\n\n463 \n\n\n\n"Look out I" came a frightened cry from a \nsoldier and, like a bird whirring in rapid flight \nand alighting on the ground, a shell dropped \nwith little noise within two steps of Prince An- \ndrew and close to the battalion commander's \nhorse. The horse first, regardless of whether it \nwas right or wrong to show fear, snorted, reared \nalmost throwing the major, and galloped aside. \nThe horse's terror infected the men. \n\n"Lie down!" cried the adjutant, throwing \nhimself flat on the ground. \n\nPrince Andrew hesitated. The smoking shell \nspun like a top between him and the prostrate \nadjutant, near a wormwood plant between the \nfield and the meadow. \n\n"Can this be death?" thought Prince An- \ndrew, looking with a quite new, envious glance \nat the grass, the wormwood, and the streamlet \nof smoke that curled up from the rotating \nblack ball. "I cannot, I do not wish to die. I \nlove life I love this grass, this earth, this \nair. . . ." He thought this, and at the same time \nremembered that people were looking at him. \n\n"It's shameful, sirl" he said to the adjutant. \n"What . . ." \n\nHe did not finish speaking. At one and the \nsame moment came the sound of an explosion, \na whistle of splinters as from a breaking win- \ndow frame, a suffocating smell of powder, and \nPrince Andrew started to one side, raising his \narm, and fell on his chest. Several officers ran \nup to him. From the right side of his abdomen, \nblood was welling out making a large stain on \nthe grass. \n\nThe militiamen with stretchers who were \ncalled up stood behind the officers. Prince An- \ndrew lay on his chest with his face in the grass, \nbreathing heavily and noisily. \n\n"What are you waiting for? Come alongl" \n\nThe peasants went up and took him by his \nshoulders and legs, but he moaned piteously \nand, exchanging looks, they set him down \nagain. \n\n"Pick him up, lift him, it's all the samel" \ncried someone. \n\nThey again took him by the shoulders and \nlaid him on the stretcher. \n\n"Ah, God! My God! What is it? The stom- \nach? That means death! My God!" voices \namong the officers were heard saying. \n\n"It flew a hair's breadth past my ear," said \nthe adjutant. \n\nThe peasants, adjusting the stretcher to their \nshoulders, started hurriedly along the path \nthey had trodden down, to the dressing sta- \ntion. \n\n\n\n"Keep in step! Ah . . . those peasants!" \nshouted an officer, seizing by their shoulder's \nand checking the peasants, who were walking \nunevenly and jolting the stretcher. \n\n"Get into step, Fedor ... I say, Fedorl" said \nthe foremost peasant. \n\n"Now that's right!" said the one behind joy- \nfully, when he had got into step. \n\n"Your excellency! Eh, Prince!" said the \ntrembling voice of Tim6khin, who had run up \nand was looking down on the stretcher. \n\nPrince Andrew opened his eyes and looked \nup at the speaker from the stretcher into which \nhis head had sunk deep and again his eyelids \ndrooped. \n\nThe militiamen carried Prince Andrew to \nthe dressing station by the wood, where wagons \nwere stationed. The dressing station consisted \nof three tents with flaps turned back, pitched \nat the edge of a birch wood. In the wood, wag- \nons and horses were standing. The horses were \neating oats from their movable troughs and \nsparrows flew down and peeked the grains that \nfell. Some crows, scenting blood, flew among \nthe birch trees cawing impatiently. Around \nthe tents, over more than five acres, blood- \nstained men in various garbs stood, sat, or lay. \nAround the wounded stood crowds of soldier \nstretcher-bearers with dismal and attentive \nfaces, whom the officers keeping order tried in \nvain to drive from the spot. Disregarding the \nofficers' orders, the soldiers stood leaning \nagainst their stretchers and gazing intently, as \nif trying to comprehend the difficult problem \nof what was taking place before them. From \nthe tents came now loud angry cries and now \nplaintive groans. Occasionally dressers ran out \nto fetch water, or to point out those who were \nto be brought in next. The wounded men \nawaiting their turn outside the tents groaned, \nsighed, wept, screamed, swore, or asked for \nvodka. Some were delirious. Prince Andrew's \nbearers, stepping over the wounded who had \nnot yet been bandaged, took him, as a regi- \nmental commander, close up to one of the tents \nand there stopped, awaiting instructions. \nPrince Andrew opened his eyes and for a long \ntime could not make out what was going on \naround him. He remembered the meadow, \nthe wormwood, the field, the whirling black \nball, and his sudden rush of passionate love of \nlife. Two steps from him, leaning against a \nbranch and talking loudly and attracting gen- \neral attention, stood a tall, handsome, black- \nhaired noncommissioned officer with a ban- \n\n\n\n464 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\ndaged head. He had been wounded in the \nhead and leg by bullets. Around him, eagerly \nlistening to his talk, a crowd of wounded and \nstretcher-bearers was gathered. \n\n"We kicked him out from there so that \nhe chucked everything, we grabbed the King \nhimself I" cried he, looking around him \nwith eyes that glittered with fever. "If only \nreserves had come up just then, lads, there \nwouldn't have been nothing left of himl I tell \nyou surely. . . ." \n\nLike all the others near the speaker, Prince \nAndrew looked at him with shining eyes and \nexperienced a sense of comfort. "But isn't it \nall the same now?" thought he. "And what will \nbe there, and what has there been here? Why \nwas I so reluctant to part with life? There was \nsomething in this life I did not and do not \nunderstand." \n\nCHAPTER XXXVII \nONE OF THE DOCTORS came out of the tent in a \nbloodstained apron, holding a cigar between \nthe thumb and little finger of one of his small \nbloodstained hands, so as not to smear it. He \nraised his head and looked about him, but \nabove the level of the wounded men. He evi- \ndently wanted a little respite. After turning \nhis head from right to left for some time, he \nsighed and looked down. \n\n"All right, immediately," he replied to a \ndresser who pointed Prince Andrew out to \nhim, and he told them to carry him into the \ntent. \n\nMurmurs arose among the wounded who \nwere waiting. \n\n"It seems that even in the next world only \nthe gentry are to have a chance!" remarked \none. \n\nPrince Andrew was carried in and laid on a \ntable that had only just been cleared and which \na dresser was washing down. Prince Andrew \ncould not make out distinctly what was in that \ntent. The pitiful groans from all sides and the \ntorturing pain in his thigh, stomach, and back \ndistracted him. All he saw about him merged \ninto a general impression of naked, bleeding \nhuman bodies that seemed to fill the whole of \nthe low tent, as a few weeks previously, on that \nhot August day, such bodies had filled the \ndirty pond beside the Smolensk road. Yes, it \nwas the same flesh, the same chair &amp; canon, the \nsight of which had even then filled him with \nhorror, as by a presentiment. \n\nThere were three operating tables in the \ntent. Two were occupied, and on the third \n\n\n\nthey placed Prince Andrew, For a little while \nhe was left alone and involuntarily witnessed \nwhat was taking place on the other two tables. \nOn the nearest one sat a Tartar, probably a \nCossack, judging by the uniform thrown down \nbeside him. Four soldiers were holding him, \nand a spectacled doctor was cutting into his \nmuscular brown back. \n\n"Ooh, ooh, oohl" grunted the Tartar, and \nsuddenly lifting up his swarthy snub-nosed \nface with its high cheekbones, and baring his \nwhite teeth, he began to wriggle and twitch \nhis body and utter piercing, ringing, and pro- \nlonged yells. On the other table, round which \nmany people were crowding, a tall well-fed \nman lay on his back with his head thrown \nback. His curly hair, its color, and the shape \nof his head seemed strangely familiar to Prince \nAndrew. Several dressers were pressing on his \nchest to hold him down. One large, white, \nplump leg twitched rapidly all the time with a \nfeverish tremor. The man was sobbing and \nchoking convulsively. Two doctors one of \nwhom was pale and trembling were silently \ndoing something to this man's other, gory leg. \nWhen he had finished with the Tartar, whom \nthey covered with an overcoat, the spectacled \ndoctor came up to Prince Andrew, wiping his \nhands. \n\nHe glanced at Prince Andrew's face and \nquickly turned away. \n\n"Undress him! What are you waiting for?" \nhe cried angrily to the dressers. \n\nHis very first, remotest recollections of child- \nhood came back to Prince Andrew's mind when \nthe dresser with sleeves rolled up began hastily \nto undo the buttons of his clothes and un- \ndressed him. The doctor bent down over the \nwound, felt it, and sighed deeply. Then he \nmade a sign to someone, and the torturing pain \nin his abdomen caused Prince Andrew to lose \nconsciousness. When he came to himself the \nsplintered portions of his thighbone had been \nextracted, the torn flesh cut away, and the \nwound bandaged. Water was being sprinkled \non his face. As soon as Prince Andrew opened \nhis eyes, the doctor bent over, kissed him silent- \nly on the lips, and hurried away. \n\nAfter the sufferings he had been enduring, \nPrince Andrew enjoyed a blissful feeling such \nas he had riot experienced for a long time. All \nthe best and happiest moments of his life es \npecially his earliest childhood, when he used to \nbe undressed and put to bed, and when lean- \ning over him his nurse sang him to sleep and \nhe, burying his head in the pillow, felt happy \n\n\n\nBOOK \n\nin the mere consciousness of life returned to \nhis memory, not merely as something past but \nas something present. \n\nThe doctors were busily engaged with the \nwounded man the shape of whose head seemed \nfamiliar to Prince Andrew: they were lifting \nhim up and trying to quiet him. \n\n"Show it to me Oh,ooh . . . Ohl Oh,oohl" \n\nhis frightened moans could be heard, subdued \nby suffering and broken by sobs. \n\nHearing those moans Prince Andrew wanted \nto weep. Whether because he was dying with- \nout glory, or because he was sorry to part with \nlife, or because of those memories of a child- \nhood that could not return, or because he was \nsuffering and others were suffering and that \nman near him was groaning so piteously he \nfelt like weeping childlike, kindly, and al- \nmost happy tears. \n\nThe wounded man was shown his amputat- \ned leg stained with clotted blood and with the \nboot still on. \n\n"Oh! Oh, oohl" he sobbed, like a woman. \n\nThe doctor who had been standing beside \nhim, preventing Prince Andrew from seeing \nhis face, moved away. \n\n"My Godl What is this? Why is he here?" \nsaid Prince Andrew to himself. \n\nIn the miserable, sobbing, enfeebled man \nwhose leg had just been amputated, he recog- \nnized Anatole Kuragin. Men were supporting \nhim in their arms and offering him a glass of \nwater, but his trembling, swollen lips could \nnot grasp its rim. Anatole was sobbing pain- \nfully. "Yes, it is he! Yes, that man is somehow \nclosely and painfully connected with me," \nthought Prince Andrew, not yet clearly grasp- \ning what he saw before him. "What is the con- \nnection of that man with my childhood and my \nlife?" he asked himself without finding an an- \nswer. And suddenly a new unexpected memory \nfrom that realm of pure and loving childhood \npresented itself to him. He remembered Na- \ntasha as he had seen her for the first time at the \nball in 1810, with her slender neck and arms and \nwith a frightened happy face ready for rapture, \nand love and tenderness for her, stronger and \nmore vivid than ever, awoke in his soul. He \nnow remembered the connection that existed \nbetween himself and this man who was dimly \ngazing at him through tears that filled his swol- \nlen eyes. He remembered everything, and ec- \nstatic pity and love for that man overflowed \nhis happy heart. \n\nPrince Andrew could no longer restrain him- \nself and wept tender loving tears for his fel- \n\n\n\nTEN 465 \n\nlow men, for himself, and for his own and \ntheir errors. \n\n"Compassion, love of our brothers, for those \nwho love us and for those who hate us, love of \nour enemies; yes, that love which God preached \non earth and which Princess Mary taught me \nand I did not understand that is what made \nme sorry to part with life, that is what re- \nmained for me had I lived. But now it is too \nlate. I know it 1" \n\nCHAPTER XXXVIII \nTHE TERRIBLE SPECTACLE of the battlefield cov- \nered with dead and wounded, together with \nthe heaviness of his head and the news that \nsome twenty generals he knew personally had \nbeen killed or wounded, and the consciousness \nof the impotence of his once mighty arm, pro- \nduced an unexpected impression on Napoleon \nwho usually liked to look at the killed and \nwounded, thereby, he considered, testing his \nstrength of mind. This day the horrible ap- \npearance of the battlefield overcame that \nstrength of mind which he thought constitut- \ned his merit and his greatness. He rode hurried- \nly from the battlefield and returned to the She- \nvardino knoll, where he sat on his campstool, \nhis sallow face swollen and heavy, his eyes dim, \nhis nose red, and his voice hoarse, involunta- \nrily listening, with downcast eyes, to the sounds \nof firing. With painful dejection he awaited \nthe end of this action, in which he regarded \nhimself as a participant and which he was un- \nable to arrest. A personal, human feeling for \na brief moment got the better of the artificial \nphantasm of life he had served so long. He \nfelt in his own person the sufferings and death \nhe had witnessed on the battlefield. The heavi- \nness of his head and chest reminded him of the \npossibility of suffering and death for himself. \nAt that moment he did not desire Moscow, or \nvictory, or glory (what need had he for any \nmore glory?). The one thing he wished for was \nrest, tranquillity, and freedom. But when he \nhad been on the Semenovsk heights the artil- \nlery commander had proposed to him to bring \nseveral batteries of artillery up to those heights \nto strengthen the fire on the Russian troops \ncrowded in front of Knyazkovo. Napoleon had \nassented and had given orders that news should \nbe brought him of the effect those batteries \nproduced. \n\nAn adjutant came now to inform him that \nthe fire of two hundred guns had been concen- \ntrated on the Russians, as he had ordered, but \nthat they still held their ground. \n\n\n\n466 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\n"Our fire is mowing them down by rows, but \nstill they hold on," said the adjutant \n\n"They want more! . . ." said Napoleon in a \nhoarse voice. \n\n"Sire?" asked the adjutant who had not heard \nthe remark. \n\n"They want more!" croaked Napoleon \nfrowning. "Let them have it!" \n\nEven before he gave that order the thing he \ndid not desire, and for which he gave the order \nonly because he thought it was expected of \nhim, was being done. And he fell back into \nthat artificial realmof imaginary greatness, and \nagainas a horse walking a treadmill thinks \nit is doing something for itself he submissive- \nly fulfilled the cruel, sad, gloomy, and inhuman \nrole predestined for him. \n\nAnd not for that day and hour alone were the \nmind and conscience darkened of this man on \nwhom the responsibility for what was happen- \ning lay more than on all the others who took \npart in it. Never to the end of his life could he \nunderstand goodness, beauty, or truth, or the \nsignificance of his actions which were too con- \ntrary to goodness and truth, too remote from \neverything human, for him ever to be able to \ngrasp their meaning. He could not disavow his \nactions, belauded as they were by half the world, \nand so he had to repudiate truth, goodness, and \nall humanity. \n\nNot only on that day, as he rode over the \nbattlefield strewn with men killed and maimed \n(by his will as he believed), did he reckon as \nhe looked at them how many Russians there \nwere for each Frenchman and, deceiving him- \nself, find reason for rejoicing in the calculation \nthat there were five Russians for every French- \nman. Not on that day alone did he write in a \nletter to Paris that "the battlefield was superb," \nbecause fifty thousand corpses lay there, but \neven on the island of St. Helena in the peace- \nful solitude where he said he intended to de- \nvote his leisure to an account of the great deeds \nhe had done, he wrote: \n\nThe Russian war should have been the most \npopular war of modern times: it was a war of good \nsense, for real interests, for the tranquillity and \nsecurity of all; it was purely pacific and conserva- \ntive. \n\nIt was a war for a great cause, the end of un- \ncertainties and the beginning of security. A new \nhorizon and new labors were opening out, full of \nwell-being and prosperity for all. The European \nsystem was already founded; all that remained \nwas to organize it. \n\nSatisfied on these great points and with tran- \nquillity everywhere, I too should have had my \n\n\n\nCongress and my Holy Alliance. Those ideas were \nstolen from me. In that reunion of great sovereigns \nwe should have discussed our interests like one \nfamily, and have rendered account to the peoples \nas clerk to master. \n\nEurope would in this way soon have been, in \nfact, but one people, and anyone who traveled \nanywhere would have found himself always in the \ncommon fatherland. I should have demanded the \nfreedom of all navigable rivers for everybody, that \nthe seas should be common to all, and that the \ngreat standing armies should be reduced hence- \nforth to mere guards for the sovereigns. \n\nOn returning to France, to the bosom of the \ngreat, strong, magnificent, peaceful, and glorious \nfatherland, I should have proclaimed her frontiers \nimmutable; all future wars purely defensive, all \naggrandizement antinational. I should have as- \nsociated my son in the Empire; my dictatorship \nwould have been finished, and his constitutional \nreign would have begun. \n\nParis would have been the capital of the world, \nand the French the envy of the nations! \n\nMy leisure then, and my old age, would have \nbeen devoted, in company with the Empress and \nduring the royal apprenticeship of my son, to \nleisurely visiting, with our own horses and like a \ntrue country couple, every corner of the Empire, \nreceiving complaints, redressing wrongs, and scat- \ntering public buildings and benefactions on all \nsides and everywhere. \n\nNapoleon, predestined by Providence for \nthe gloomy role of executioner of the peo- \nples, assured himself that the aim of his actions \nhad been the peoples' welfare and that he \ncould control the fate of millions and by the \nemployment of power confer benefactions. \n\n"Of four hundred thousand men who crossed the \nVistula," he wrote further of the Russian war, \n"half were Austrians, Prussians, Saxons, Poles, Ba- \nvarians, Wurttembergers, Mecklenburgers, Span- \niards, Italians, and Neapolitans. The Imperial ar- \nmy, strictly speaking, was one third composed of \nDutch, Belgians, men from the borders of the \nRhine, Piedmontese, Swiss, Genevese, Tuscans, Ro- \nmans, inhabitants of the Thirty-second Military \nDivision, of Bremen, of Hamburg, and so on: it \nincluded scarcely a hundred and forty thousand \nwho spoke French. The Russian expedition actual- \nly cost France less than fifty thousand men; the \nRussian army in its retreat from Vttna to Moscow \nlost in the various battles four times more men \nthan the French army; the burning of Moscow cost \nthe lives of a hundred thousand Russians who died \nof cold and want in the woods; finally, in its march \nfrom Moscow to the Oder the Russian army also \nsuffered from the severity of the season; so that \nby the the time it reached Vilna it numbered only \nfifty thousand, and at Kalisch less than eighteen \nthousand." \n\n\n\nBOOK TEN \n\n\n\n467 \n\n\n\nHe imagined that the war with Russia came \nabout by his will, and the horrors that occurred \ndid not stagger his soul. He boldly took the \nwhole responsibility for what happened, and \nhis darkened mind found justification in the \nbelief that among the hundreds of thousands \nwho perished there were fewer Frenchmen \nthan Hessians and Bavarians. \n\nCHAPTER XXXIX \n\nSEVERAL TENS OF THOUSANDS of the slain lay in \ndiverse postures and various uniforms on the \nfields and meadows belonging to the Davydov \nfamily and to the crown serfs those fields and \nmeadows where for hundreds of years the \npeasants of Borodin6, G6rki, Shevardino, and \nSemenovsk had reaped their harvests and pas- \ntured their cattle. At the dressing stations the \ngrass and earth were soaked with blood for a \nspace of some three acres around. Crowds of \nmen of various arms, wounded and unwound- \ned, with frightened faces, dragged themselves \nback to Mozhaysk from the one army and back \nto Valiievo from the other. Other crowds, ex- \nhausted and hungry, went forward led by their \nofficers. Others held their ground and contin- \nued to fire. \n\nOver the whole field, previously so gaily \nbeautiful with the glitter of bayonets and cloud- \nlets of smoke in the morning sun, there now \nspread a mist of damp and smoke and a strange \nacid smell of saltpeter and blood. Clouds gath- \nered and drops of rain began to fall on the dead \nand wounded, on the frightened, exhausted, \nand hesitating men, as if to say: "Enough, menl \nEnough! Cease . . . bethink yourselvesl What \nare you doing?" \n\nTo the men of both sides alike, worn out by \nwant of food and rest, it began equally to ap- \npear doubtful whether they should continue \nto slaughter one another; all the faces ex- \npressed hesitation, and the question arose in \nevery soul: "For what, for whom, must I kill \nand be killed? . . . You may go and kill whom \nyou please, but I don't want to do so any more I" \nBy evening this thought had ripened in every \nsoul. At any moment these men might have \nbeen seized with horror at what they were do- \ning and might have thrown up everything and \nrun away anywhere. \n\nBut though toward the end of the battle the \nmen felt all the horror of what they were do- \ning, though they would have been glad to \nleave off, some incomprehensible, mysterious \npower continued to control them, and they \nstill brought up the charges, loaded, aimed, \n\n\n\nand applied the match, though only one artil- \nleryman survived out of every three, and \nthough they stumbled and panted with fatigue, \nperspiring and stained with blood and pow- \nder. The cannon balls flew just as swiftly and \ncruelly from both sides, crushing human bod- \nies, and that terrible work which was not done \nby the will of a man but at the will of Him \nwho governs men and worlds continued. \n\nAnyone looking at the disorganized rear of \nthe Russian army would have said that, if only \nthe French made one more slight effort, it \nwould disappear; and anyone looking at the \nrear of the French army would have said that \nthe Russians need only make one more slight \neffort and the French would be destroyed. But \nneither the French nor the Russians made that \neffort, and the flame of battle burned slowly \nout. \n\nThe Russians did not make that effort be- \ncause they were not attacking the French. At \nthe beginning of the battle theystood blocking \nthe way to Moscow and they still did so at the \nend of the battle as at the beginning. But even \nhad the aim of the Russians been to drive the \nFrench from their positions, they could not \nhave made this last effort, for all the Russian \ntroops had been broken up, there was no part \nof the Russian army that had not suffered in \nthe battle, and though still holding their \npositions they had lost ONE HALF of their \narmy. \n\nThe French, with the memory of all their \nformer victories during fifteen years, with the \nassurance of Napoleon's invincibility, with \nthe consciousness that they had captured part \nof the battlefield and had lost only a quarter \nof their men and still had their Guards intact, \ntwenty thousand strong, might easily have \nmade that effort. The French who had attacked \nthe Russian army in order to drive it from its \nposition ought to have made that effort, for \nas long as the Russians continued to block the \nroad to Moscow as before, the aim of the \nFrench had not been attained and all their \nefforts and losses were in vain. But the French \ndid not make that effort. Some historians say \nthat Napoleon need only have used his Old \nGuards, who were intact, and the battle would \nhave been won. To speak of what would have \nhappened had Napoleon sent his Guards is \nlike talking of what would happen if autumn \nbecame spring. It could not be. Napoleon did \nnot give his Guards, not because he did not \nwant to, but because it could not be done. All \nthe generals, officers, and soldiers of the French \n\n\n\n4 68 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\narmy knew it could not be done, because the \nflagging spirit of the troops would not permit \nit. \n\nIt was not Napoleon alone who had experi- \nenced that nightmare feeling of the mighty \narm being stricken powerless, but all the gen- \nerals and soldiers of his army whether they \nhad taken part in the battle or not, after all \ntheir experience of previous battles when aft- \ner one tenth of such efforts the enemy had fled \nexperienced a similar feeling of terror before \nan enemy who, after losing HALF his men, stood \nas threateningly at the end as at the beginning \nof the battle. The moral force of the attacking \nFrench army was exhausted. Not that sort of \nvictory which is defined by the capture of pieces \nof material fastened to sticks, called standards, \nand of the ground on which the troops had \nstood and were standing, but a moral victory \nthat convinces the enemy of the moral superi- \n\n\n\nority of his opponent and of his own impotence \nwas gained by the Russians at Borodin6. The \nFrench invaders, like an infuriated animal that \nhas in its onslaught received a mortal wound, \nfelt that they were perishing, but could not \nstop, any more than the Russian army, weak- \ner by one half, could help swerving. By the im- \npetus gained, the French army was still able to \nroll forward to Moscow, but there, without \nfurther effort on the part of the Russians, it \nhad to perish, bleeding from the mortal wound \nit had received at Borodin6. The direct conse- \nquence of the battle of Borodino was Napo- \nleon's senseless flight from Moscow, his retreat \nalong the old Smolensk road, the destruction \nof the invading army of five hundred thousand \nmen, and the downfall of Napoleonic France, \non which at Borodino for the first time the \nhand of an opponent of stronger spirit had \nbeen laid. \n\n\n\nBook Eleven: 1812 \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I \n\nABSOLUTE CONTINUITY of motion is not compre- \nhensible to the human mind. Laws of motion \nof any kind become comprehensible to man \nonly when he examines arbitrarily selected el- \nements of that motion; but at the same time, \na large proportion of human error comes from \nthe arbitrary division of continuous motion \ninto discontinuous elements. There is a well- \nknown, so-called sophism of the ancients con- \nsisting in this, that Achilles could never catch \nup with a tortoise he was following, in spite of \nthe fact that he traveled ten times as fast as the \ntortoise. By the time Achilles has covered the \ndistance that separated him from the tortoise, \nthe tortoise has covered one tenth of that dis- \ntance ahead of him: when Achilles has covered \nthat tenth, the tortoise has covered another one \nhundredth, and so on forever. This problem \nseemed to the ancients insoluble. The absurd \nanswer (that Achilles could never overtake the \ntortoise) resulted from this: that motion was \narbitrarily divided into discontinuous ele- \nments, whereas the motion both of Achilles \nand of the tortoise was continuous. \n\nBy adopting smaller and smaller elements of \nmotion we only approach a solution of the \nproblem, but never reach it. Only when we \nhave admitted the conception of the infinite- \nly small, and the resulting geometrical pro- \ngression with a common ratio of one tenth, \nand have found the sum of this progression \nto infinity, do we reach a solution of the prob- \nlem. \n\nA modern branch of mathematics having \nachieved the art of dealing with the infinitely \nsmall can now yield solutions in other more \ncomplex problems of motion which used to \nappear insoluble. \n\nThis modern branch of mathematics, un- \nknown to the ancients, when dealing with \nproblems of motion admits the conception of \nthe infinitely small, and so conforms to the \nchief condition of motion (absolute continui- \nty) and thereby corrects the inevitable error \n\n\n\nwhich the human mind cannot avoid when \nit deals with separate elements of motion in- \nstead of examining continuous motion. \n\nIn seeking the laws of historical movement \njust the same thing happens. The movement of \nhumanity, arising as it does from innumerable \narbitrary human wills, is continuous. \n\nTo understand the laws of this continuous \nmovement is the aim of history. But to arrive \nat these laws, resulting from the sum of all those \nhuman wills, man's mind postulates arbitrary \nand disconnected units. The first method of \nhistory is to take an arbitrarily selected series \nof continuous events and examine it apart \nfrom others, though there is and can be no be- \nginning to any event, for one event always \nflows uninterruptedly from another. \n\nThe second method is to consider the ac- \ntions of some one man a king or a command- \neras equivalent to the sum of many individ- \nual wills; whereas the sum of individual wills \nis never expressed by the activity of a single his- \ntoric personage. \n\nHistorical science in its endeavor to draw \nnearer to truth continually takes smaller and \nsmaller units for examination. But however \nsmall the units it takes, we feel that to take \nany unit disconnected from others, or to as- \nsume a beginning of any phenomenon, or to \nsay that the will of many men is expressed by \nthe actions of any one historic personage, is in \nitself false. \n\nIt needs no critical exertion to reduce utter- \nly to dust any deductions drawn from history. \nIt is merely necessary to select some larger or \nsmaller unit as the subject of observation as \ncriticism has every right to do, seeing that \nwhatever unit history observes must always be \narbitrarily selected. \n\nOnly by taking infinitesimally small units \nfor observation (the differential of history, \nthat is, the individual tendencies of men) and \nattaining to the art of integrating them (that \nis, finding the sum of these infinitesimals) can \nwe hope to arrive at the laws of history. \n\n\n\n469 \n\n\n\n470 \n\n\n\nThe first fifteen years of the nineteenth cen- \ntury in Europe present an extraordinary move- \nment of millions of people. Men leave their \ncustomary pursuits, hasten from one side of \nEurope to the other, plunder and slaughter \none another, triumph and are plunged in de- \nspair, and for some years the whole course of \nlife is altered and presents an intensive move- \nment which first increases and then slackens. \nWhat was the cause of this movement, by what \nlaws was it governed? asks the mind of man. \n\nThe historians, replying to this question, lay \nbefore us the sayings and doings of a few dozen \nmen in a building in the city of Paris, calling \nthese sayings and doings "the Revolution"; \nthen they give a detailed biography of Napo- \nleon and of certain people favorable or hostile \nto him; tell of the influence some of these peo- \nple had on others, and say: that is why this \nmovement took place and those are its laws. \n\nBut the mind of man not only refuses to be- \nlieve this explanation, but plainly says that \nthis method of explanation is fallacious, be- \ncause in it a weaker phenomenon is taken as \nthe cause of a stronger. The sum of human \nwills produced the Revolution and Napoleon, \nand only the sum of those wills first tolerated \nand then destroyed them. \n\n"But every time there have been conquests \nthere have been conquerors; every time there \nhas been a revolution in any state there have \nbeen great men," says history. And, indeed, hu- \nman reason replies: every time conquerors ap- \npear there have been wars, but this does not \nprove that the conquerors caused the wars and \nthat it is possible to find the laws of a war in \nthe personal activity of a single man. When- \never I look at my watch and its hands point to \nten, I hear the bells of the neighbor ing church; \nbut because the bells begin to ring when the \nhands of the clock reach ten, I have no right to \nassume that the movement of the bells is caused \nby the position of the hands of the watch. \n\nWhenever I see the movement of a locomo- \ntive I hear the whistle and see the valves open- \ning and wheels turning; but I have no right to \nconclude that the whistling and the turning of \nwheels are the cause of the movement of the \nengine. \n\nThe peasants say that a cold wind blows in \nlate spring because the oaks are budding, and \nreally every spring cold winds do blow when \nthe oak is budding. But though I do not know \nwhat causes the cold winds to blow when the \noak buds unfold, I cannot agree with the peas- \nants that the unfolding of the oak buds is the \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\ncause of the cold wind, for the force of the \nwind is beyond the influence of the buds. I see \nonly a coincidence of occurrences such as hap- \npens with all the phenomena of life, and I see \nthat however much and however carefully I \nobserve the hands of the watch, and the valves \nand wheels of the engine, and the oak, I shall \nnot discover the cause of the bells ringing, the \nengine moving, or of the winds of spring. Todo \nthat I must entirely change my point of view \nand study the laws of the movement of steam, \nof the bells, and of the wind. History must do \nthe same. And attempts in this direction have \nalready been made. \n\nTo study the laws of history we must com- \npletely change the subject of our observation, \nmust leave aside kings, ministers, and generals, \nand study the common, infmitcsimally small \nelements by which the masses are moved. No \none can say in how far it is possible for man to \nadvance in this way toward an understanding \nof the laws of history; but it is evident that on- \nly along that path does the possibility of discov- \nering the laws of history lie, and that as yet \nnot a millionth part as much mental effort has \nbeen applied in this direction by historians as \nhas been devoted to describing the actions of \nvarious kings, commanders, and ministers and \npropounding the historians' own reflections \nconcerning these actions. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER II \n\nTHE FORCES of a dozen European nations burst \ninto Russia. The Russian army and people \navoided a collision till Smolensk was reached, \nand again from Smolensk to Borodin6. The \nFrench army pushed on to Moscow, its goal, its \nimpetus ever increasing as it neared its aim, \njust as the velocity of a falling body increases \nas it approaches the earth. Behind it were sev- \nen hundred miles of hunger-stricken, hostile \ncountry; ahead were a few dozen miles sepa- \nrating it from its goal. Every soldier in Napo- \nleon's army felt this and the invasion moved \non by its own momentum. \n\nThe more the Russian army retreated the \nmore fiercely a spirit of hatred of the enemy \nflared up, and while it retreated the army in- \ncreased and consolidated. At Borodin6 a col- \nlision took place. Neither army was broken \nup, but the Russian army retreated immediate- \nly after the collision as inevitably as a ball re- \ncoils after colliding with another having a \ngreater momentum, and with equal inevitabil- \nity the ball of invasion that had advanced with \nsuch momentum rolled on for some distance, \n\n\n\nBOOK ELEVEN \n\n\n\n47 1 \n\n\n\nthough the collision had deprived it of all its \nforce. \n\nThe Russians retreated eighty milesto be- \nyond Moscowand the French reached Mos- \ncow and there came to a standstill. For five \nweeks after that there was not a single battle. \nThe French did not move. As a bleeding, mor- \ntally wounded animal licks its wounds, they \nremained inert in Moscow for five weeks, and \nthen suddenly, with no fresh reason, fled back: \nthey made a dash for the Kaluga road, and \n(after a victory for at Malo-Yaroslavets the \nfield of conflict again remained theirs) without \nundertaking a single serious battle, they fled \nstill more rapidly back to Smolensk, beyond \nSmolensk, beyond the Berezina, beyond Vilna, \nand farther still. \n\nOn the eveningof the twenty-sixth of August, \nKutuzov and the whole Russian army were con- \nvinced that the battle of Borodino was a victory. \nKutuzov reported so to the Emperor. He gave \norders to prepare for a fresh conflict to finish \nthe enemy and did this not to deceive anyone, \nbut because he knew that the enemy was beat- \nen, as everyone who had taken part in the bat- \ntle knew it. \n\nBut all that evening and next day reports \ncame in one after another of unheard-of losses, \nof the loss of half the army, and a fresh battle \nproved physically impossible. \n\nIt was impossible to give battle before infor- \nmation had been collected, the wounded gath- \nered in, the supplies of ammunition replen- \nished, the slain reckoned up, new officers ap- \npointed to replace those who had been killed, \nand before the men had had food and sleep. \nAnd meanwhile, the very next morning after \nthe battle, the French army advanced of itself \nupon the Russians, carried forward by the \nforce of its own momentum now seemingly in- \ncreased in inverse proportion to the square of \nthe distance from its aim. Kutuzov's wish was \nto attack next day, and the whole army desired \nto do so. But to make an attack the wish to do \nso is not sufficient, there must also be a possi- \nbility of doing it, and that possibility did not \nexist. It was impossible not to retreat a day's \nmarch, and then in the same way it was impos- \nsible not to retreat another and a third day's \nmarch, and at last, on the first of September \nwhen the army drew near Moscow despite the \nstrength of the feeling that had arisen in all \nranks the force of circumstances compelled it \nto retire beyond Moscow. And the troops re- \ntired one more, last, day's march, and aban- \ndoned Moscow to the enemy. \n\n\n\nFor people accustomed to think that plans \nof campaign and battles are made by generals \nas any one of us sitting over a map in his \nstudy may imagine how he would have ar- \nranged things in this or that battle the ques- \ntions present themselves: Why did Kutuzov \nduring the retreat not do this or that? Why did \nhe not take up a position before reaching Fill? \nWhy did he not retire at once by the Kaluga \nroad, abandoning Moscow? and so on. People \naccustomed to think in that way forget, or do \nnot know, the inevitable conditions which al- \nways limit the activities of any commander in \nchief. The activity of a commander in chief \ndoes not at all resemble the activity we imagine \nto ourselves when we sit at ease in our studies \nexamining some campaign on the map, with \na certain number of troops on this and that \nside in a certain known locality, and begin our \nplans from some given moment. A commander \nin chief is never dealing with the beginning of \nany event the position from which we always \ncontemplate it. The commander in chief is \nalways in the midst of a series of shifting events \nand so he never can at any moment consider \nthe whole import of an event that is occurring. \nMoment by moment the event is imperceptibly \nshaping itself, and at every moment of thiscon- \ntinuous, uninterrupted shaping of events the \ncommander in chief is in the midst of a most \ncomplex play of intrigues, worries, contingen- \ncies, authorities, projects, counsels, threats, and \ndeceptions and is continually obliged to reply \nto innumerable questions addressed to him, \nwhich constantly conflict with one another. \n\nLearned military authorities quite seriously \ntell us that Kutuzov should have moved his ar- \nmy to the Kaluga road long before reaching \nFiH, and that somebody actually submitted \nsuch a proposal to him. But a commander in \nchief, especially at a difficult moment, has al- \nways before him not one proposal but dozens \nsimultaneously. And all these proposals, based \non strategics and tactics, contradict each other. \n\nA commander in chiefs business, it would \nseem, is simply to choose one of these projects. \nBut even that he cannot do. Events and time \ndo not wait. For instance, on the twenty-eighth \nit is suggested to him to cross to the Kaluga \nroad, but just then an adjutant gallops up from \nMilorddovich asking whether he is to engage \nthe French or retire. An order must be given \nhim at once, that instant. And the order to re- \ntreat carries us past the turn to the Kaluga \nroad. And after the adjutant comes the com- \nmissary general asking where the stores are to \n\n\n\n47* \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nbe taken, and the chief of the hospitals asks \nwhere the wounded are to go, and a courier \nfrom Petersburg brings a letter from the sov- \nereign which does not admit of the possibility \nof abandoning Moscow, and the commander \nin chief's rival, the man who is undermining \nhim (and there are always not merely one but \nseveral such), presents a new project diametri- \ncally opposed to that of turning to the Kaluga \nroad, and the commander in chief himself \nneeds sleep and refreshment to maintain his \nenergy, and a respectable general who has \nbeen overlooked in the distribution of rewards \ncomes to complain, and the inhabitants of the \ndistrict pray to be defended, and an officer sent \nto inspect the locality comes in and gives a re- \nport quite contrary to what was said by the \nofficer previously sent; and a spy, a prisoner, \nand a general who has been on reconnaissance, \nall describe the position of the enemy's army \ndifferently. People accustomed to misunder- \nstand or to forget these inevitable conditions \nof a commander in chiefs actions describe to \nus, for instance, the position of the army at \nFill and assume that the commander in chief \ncould, on the first of September, quite freely \ndecide whether to abandon Moscow or defend \nit; whereas, with the Russian army less than \nfour miles from Moscow, no such question \nexisted. When had that question been settled? \nAt Drissa and at Smolensk and most palpably \nof all on the twenty-fourth of August at She- \nvardino and on the twenty-sixth at liorodino, \nand each day and hour and minute of the \nretreat from Borodin6 to Fill. \n\nCHAPTER III \n\nWHEN ERMOLOV, having been sent by Kutuzov \nto inspect the position, told the field marshal \nthat it was impossible to fight there before \nMoscow and that they must retreat, Kutuzov \nlooked at him in silence. \n\n"Give me your hand," said he and, turning \nit over so as to feel the pulse, added: "You are \nnot well, my dear fellow. Think what you are \nsaying!" \n\nKutuzov could not yet admit the possibility \nof retreating beyond Moscow without a battle. \n\nOn the Poklonny Hill, four miles from the \nDorogomilov gate of Moscow, Kutuzov got out \nof his carriage and sat down on a bench by the \nroadside. A great crowd of generals gathered \nround him, and Count Rostopchin, who had \ncome out from Moscow, joined them. This \nbrilliant company separated into several \ngroups who all discussed the advantages and \n\n\n\ndisadvantages of the position, the state of the \narmy, the plans suggested, the situation of \nMoscow, and military questions generally. \nThough they had not been summoned for the \npurpose, and though it was not so called, they \nall felt that this was really a council of war. \nThe conversations all dealt with public ques- \ntions. If anyone gave or asked for personal \nnews, it was done in a whisper and they im- \nmediately reverted to general matters. No jokes, \nor laughter, or smiles even, were seen among \nall these men. They evidently all made an ef- \nfort to hold themselves at the height the situa- \ntion demanded. And all these groups, while \ntalking among themselves, tried to keep near \nthe commander in chief (whose bench formed \nthe center of the gathering) and to speak so \nthat he might overhear them. The commander \nin chief listened to what was being said and \nsometimes asked them to repeat their remarks, \nbut did not himself take part in the conversa- \ntions or express any opinion. After hearing \nwhat was being said by one or other of these \ngroups he generally turned away with an air \nof disappointment, as though they were not \nspeaking of anything he wished to hear. Some \ndiscussed the position that had been chosen, \ncriticizing not the position itself so much as \nthe mental capacity of those who had chosen \nit. Others argued that a mistake had been made \nearlier and that a battle should have been \nfought two days before. Others again spoke of \nthe battle of Salamanca, which was described \nby Crosart, a newly arrived Frenchman in a \nSpanish uniform. (This Frenchman and one \nof the German princes serving with the Rus- \nsian army were discussing the siege of Sara- \ngossaand considering the possibility of defend- \ning Moscow in a similar manner.) Count Ros- \ntopchin was telling a fourth group that he was \nprepared to die with the city train bands under \nthe walls of the capital, but that he still could \nnot help regretting having been left in igno- \nrance of what was happening, and that had he \nknown it sooner things would have been dif- \nferent. ... A fifth group, displaying the pro- \nfundity of their strategic perceptions, discussed \nthe direction the troops would now have to \ntake. A sixth group was talking absolute non- \nsense. Kutiizov's expression grew more and \nmore preoccupied and gloomy. From all this \ntalk he sawonly one thing: that to defend Mos- \ncow was a physical impossibility in the full \nmeaning of those words, that is to say, so ut- \nterly impossible that if any senseless command- \ner were to give orders to fight, confusion would \n\n\n\nresult but the battle would still not take place. \nIt would not take place because the command- \ners not merely all recognized the position to be \nimpossible, but in their conversations were \nonly discussing what would happen after its \ninevitable abandonment. How could the com- \nmanders lead their troops to a field of battle \nthey considered it impossible to hold? The \nlower-grade officers and even the soldiers (who \ntoo reason) also considered the position im- \npossible and therefore could not go to fight, \nfully convinced as they were of defeat. If Ben- \nnigsen insisted on the position being defended \nand others still discussed it, the question was \nno longer important in itself but only as a pre- \ntext for disputes and intrigue. This Kutuzov \nknew well. \n\nBennigsen, who had chosen the position, \nwarmly displayed his Russian patriotism (Ku- \ntuzov could not listen to this without wincing) \nby insisting that Moscow must be defended. \nHis aim was as clear as daylight to Kutuzov: if \nthe defense failed, to throw the blame on Ku- \ntuzov who had brought the army as far as the \nSparrow Hills without giving battle; if it suc- \nceeded, to claim the success as his own; or if \nbattle were not given, to clear himself of the \ncrime of abandoning Moscow. But this intrigue \ndid not now occupy the old man's mind. One \nterrible question absorbed him and to that \nquestion he heard no reply from anyone. The \nquestion for him now was: "Have I really al- \nlowed Napoleon to reach Moscow, and when \ndid I do so? When was it decided? Can it have \nbeen yesterday when I ordered Platov to retreat, \nor was it the evening before, when I had a nap \nand told Bennigsen to issue orders? Or was it \nearlier still? . . . When, when was this terrible \naffair decided? Moscow must be abandoned. \nThe army must retreat and the order to do so \nmust be given." To give that terrible order \nseemed to him equivalent to resign ing the com- \nmand of the army. And not only did he love \npower to which he was accustomed (the hon- \nours awarded to Prince Prozorovski, under \nwhom he had served in Turkey, galled him), \nbut he was convinced that he was destined to \nsave Russia and that that was why, against the \nEmperor's wish and by the will of the people, \nhe had been chosen commander in chief. He \nwas convinced that he alone could maintain \ncommand of the army in these difficult cir- \ncumstances, and that in all the world he alone \ncould encounter the invincible Napoleon with- \nout fear, and he was horrified at the thought of \nthe order he had to issue. But something had \n\n\n\nBOOK ELEVEN 473 \n\nto be decided, and these conversations around \nhim which were assuming too free a character \nmust be stopped. \n\nHe called the most important generals to \nhim. \n\n"My head, be it good or bad, must depend \non itself," said he, rising from the bench, and \nhe rode to Fill where his carriages were wait- \ning. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV \n\nTHE COUNCIL OF WAR began to assemble at \ntwo in the afternoon in the better and roomier \npart of Andrew Savostyanov's hut. The men, \nwomen, and children of the large peasant fam- \nily crowded into the back room across the pas- \nsage. Only MaLisha, Andrew's six-yearold \ngranddaughter whom his Serene Highness had \npetted and to whom he had given a lump of \nsugar while drinking his tea, remained on the \ntop of the brick oven in the larger room. Ma- \nlasha looked down from the oven with shy de- \nlight at the faces, uniforms, and decorations \nof the generals, who one after another came \ninto the room and sat clown on the broad \nbenches in the corner under the icons. "Grand- \ndad" himself, as Malasha in her own mind \ncalled Kutuzov, sat apart in a dark corner be- \nhind the oven. lie sat, sunk deep in a folding \narmchair, and continually cleared his throat \nand pulled at the collar of his coat which, \nthough it was unbuttoned, still seemed to \npinch his neck. Those who entered went up \none by one to the field marshal; he pressed the \nhands of some and nodded to others. His ad- \njutant Kaysarov was about to draw back the \ncurtain of the window facing Kutuzov, but the \nlatter moved his hand angrily and Kaysdrov \nunderstood that his Serene Highness did not \nwish his face to be seen. \n\nRound the peasant's deal table, on which lay \nmaps, plans, pencils, and papers, so many peo- \nple gathered that the orderlies brought in an- \nother bench and put it beside the table. Erm6- \nlov, Kaysdrov, and Toll, who had just arrived, \nsat down on this bench. In the foremost place, \nimmediately under the icons, sat Barclay de \nTolly, his high forehead merging into his bald \ncrown. He had a St. George's Cross round his \nneck and looked pale and ill. He had been \nfeverish for two days and was now shivering \nand in pain. Beside him sat Uvdrov, who with \nrapid gesticulations was giving him some in- \nformation, speaking in low tones as they all \ndid. Chubby little Dokhtiirov was listening at- \ntentively with eyebrows raised and arms fold- \n\n\n\n474 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\ned on his stomach. On the other side sat Count \nOstermann-Tolst6y, seemingly absorbed in his \nown thoughts. His broad head with its bold \nfeatures and glittering eyes was resting on his \nhand. Ravski, twitching forward the black \nhair on his temples as was his habit, glanced \nnow at Kutuzov and now at the door with a \nlook of impatience. Konovnitsyn's firm, hand- \nsome, and kindly face was lit up by a tender, \nsly smile. His glance met Maldsha's, and the \nexpression of his eyes caused the little girl to \nsmile. \n\nThey were all waiting for Bennigsen, who \non the pretext of inspecting the position was \nfinishing his savory dinner. They waited for \nhim from four till six o'clock and did not be- \ngin their deliberations all that time but talked \nin low tones of other matters. \n\nOnly when Bennigsen had entered the hut \ndid Kutuzov leave his corner and draw toward \nthe table, but not near enough for the candles \nthat had been placed there to light up his face. \n\nBennigsen opened the council with the ques- \ntion: "Are we to abandon Russia's ancient and \nsacred capital without a struggle, or are we to \ndefend it?" A prolonged and general silence \nfollowed. There was a frown on every face and \nonly Kutuzov's angry grunts and occasional \ncough broke the silence. All eyes were gazing \nat him. Mal&amp;sha too looked at "Granddad." \nShe was nearest to him and saw how his face \npuckered; he seemed about to cry, but this did \nnot last long. \n\n"Russia's ancient and sacred capital!" he \nsuddenly said, repeating Bennigsen's words in \nan angry voice and thereby drawing attention \nto the false note in them. "Allow me to tell you, \nyour excellency, that that question has no \nmeaning fora Russian." (He lurched hisheavy \nbody forward.) "Such a question cannot be \nput; it is senseless! The question I have asked \nthese gentlemen to meet to discuss is a military \none. The question is that of saving Russia. Is \nit better to give up Moscow without a battle, \nor by accepting battle to risk losing the army \nas well as Moscow? That is the question on \nwhich I want your opinion," and he sank back \nin his chair. \n\nThe discussion began. Bennigsen did not \nyet consider his game lost. Admitting the view \nof Barclay and others that a defensive battle \nat Fili was impossible, but imbued with Rus- \nsian patriotism and the love of Moscow, he \nproposed to move troops from the right to the \nleft flank during the night and attack the \nFrench right flank the following day. Opin- \n\n\n\nions were divided, and arguments were ad- \nvanced for and against that project. Ermolov, \nDokhturov, and Ravski agreed with Bennig- . \nsen. Whether feeling it necessary to make a \nsacrifice before abandoning the capital or \nguided by other, personal considerations, these \ngenerals seemed not to understand that this \ncouncil could not alter the inevitable course of \nevents and that Moscow was in effect already \nabandoned. The other generals, however, un- \nderstood it and, leaving aside the question of \nMoscow, spoke of the direction the army should \ntake in its retreat. Matesha, who kept her eyes \nfixed on what was going on before her, under- \nstood the meaning of the council differently. \nIt seemed to her that it was only a personal \nstruggle between "Granddad" and "Long-coat" \nas she termed Bennigsen. She saw that they \ngrew spiteful when they spoke to one another, \nand in her heart she sided with "Granddad." \nIn the midst of the conversation she noticed \n"Granddad" give Bennigsen a quick, subtle \nglance, and then to her joy she saw that "Grand- \ndad" said something to "Long-coat" which set- \ntled him. Bennigsen suddenly reddened and \npaced angrily up and down the room. What \nso affected him was Kutuzov's calm and quiet \ncomment on the advantage or disadvantage of \nBennigsen's proposal to move troops by night \nfrom the right to the left flank to attack the \nFrench right wing. \n\n"Gentlemen," said Kutuzov, "I cannot ap- \nprove of the count's plan. Moving troops in \nclose proximity to an enemy is always danger- \nous, and military history supports that view. \nFor instance . . ." Kutuzov seemed to reflect, \nsearching for an example, then with a clear, \nnai've look at Bennigsen he added: "Oh yes; \ntake the battle of Friedland, which I think the \ncount well remembers, and which was . . . not \nfully successful, only because our troops were \nrearranged too near the enemy. . . ." \n\nThere followed a momentary pause, which \nseemed very long to them all. \n\nThe discussion recommenced, but pauses fre- \nquently occurred and they all felt that there \nwas no more to be said. \n\nDuring one of these pauses Kuttizov heaved \na deep sigh as if preparing to speak. They all \nlooked at him. \n\n"Well, gentlemen, I see that it is I who will \nhave to pay for the broken crockery," said he, \nand rising slowly he moved to the table. "Gen- \ntlemen, I have heard your views. Some of you \nwill not agree with me. But I," he paused, "by \nthe authority entrusted to me by my Sovereign \n\n\n\nBOOK ELEVEN \n\n\n\n475 \n\n\n\nand country, order a retreat." \n\nAfter that the generals began to disperse \nwith the solemnity and circumspect silence of \npeople who are leaving after a funeral. \n\nSome of the generals, in low tones and in a \nstrain very different from the way they had \nspoken during the council, communicated \nsomething to their commander in chief. \n\nMalasha, who had long been expected for \nsupper, climbed carefully backwards down \nfrom the oven, her bare little feet catching at \nits projections, and slipping between the legs \nof the generals she darted out of the room. \n\nWhen he had dismissed the generals Kutu- \nzov sat a long time with his elbows on the \ntable, thinking always of the same terrible \nquestion: "When, when did the abandonment \nof Moscow become inevitable? When was that \ndone which settled the matter? And who was \nto blame for it?" \n\n"I did not expect this/' said he to his adju- \ntant Schneider when the latter came in late \nthat night. "I did not expect this! I did not \nthink this would happen." \n\n"You should take some rest, your Serene \nHighness," replied Schneider. \n\n"But nol They shall eat horseflesh yet, like \nthe Turks I" exclaimed Kutiizov without reply- \ning, striking the table with his podgy fist. \n"They shall too, if only . . ." \n\nCHAPTER V \n\nAT THAT VERY TIME, in circumstances even more \nimportant than retreating without a battle, \nnamely the evacuation and burning of Mos- \ncow, Rostopchfn, who is usually represented \nas being the instigator of that event, acted in \nan altogether different manner from Kutiizov. \n\nAfter the battle of Borodin6 the abandon- \nment and burning of Moscow was as inevi- \ntable as the retreat of the army beyond Moscow \nwithout fighting. \n\nEvery Russian might have predicted it, not \nby reasoning but by the feeling implanted in \neach of us and in our fathers. \n\nThe same thing that took place in Moscow \nhad happened in all the towns and villages on \nRussian soil beginning with Smolensk, with- \nout the participation of Count Rostopchfn and \nhis broadsheets. The people awaited the en- \nemy unconcernedly, did not riot or become ex- \ncited or tear anyone to pieces, but faced its \nfate, feeling within it the strength to find what \nit should do at that most difficult moment. \nAnd as soon as the enemy drew near the weal thy \nclasses went away abandoning their property, \n\n\n\nwhile the poorer remained and burned and \ndestroyed what was left. \n\nThe consciousness that this would be so and \nwould always be so was and is present in the \nheart of every Russian. And a consciousness of \nthis, and a foreboding that Moscow would be \ntaken, was present in Russian Moscow society \nin 1812. Those who had quitted Moscow al- \nready in July and at the beginning of August \nshowed that they expected this. Those who \nwent away, taking what they could and aban- \ndoning their houses and half their belong- \nings, did so from the latent patriotism which \nexpresses itself not by phrases or by giving \none's children to save the fatherland and \nsimilar unnatural exploits, but unobtrusively, \nsimply, organically, and therefore in the way \nthat always produces the most powerful re- \nsults. \n\n"It is disgraceful to run away from danger; \nonly cowards are running away from Moscow," \nthey were told. In his broadsheets Rostopchin \nimpressed on them that to leave Moscow was \nshameful. They were ashamed to be called \ncowards, ashamed to leave, but still they left, \nknowing it had to be done. Why did they go? \nIt is impossible to suppose that Rostopchfn \nhad scared them by his accounts of horrors Na- \npoleon had committed in conquered countries. \nThe first people to go away were the rich edu- \ncated people who knew quite well that Vienna \nand Berlin had remained intact and that dur- \ning Napoleon's occupation the inhabitants \nhad spent their time pleasantly in the com- \npany of the charming Frenchmen whom the \nRussians, and especially the Russian ladies, \nthen liked so much. \n\nThey went away because for Russians there \ncould be no question as to whether things \nwould go well or ill under French rule in Mos- \ncow. It was out of the question to be under \nFrench rule, it would be the worst thing that \ncould happen. They went away even before \nthe battle of Borodin6 and still more rapidly \nafter it, despite Rostopchin's calls to defend \nMoscow or the announcement of his intention \nto take the wonder-working icon of the Iberi- \nan Mother of God and go to fight, or of the \nballoons that were to destroy the French, and \ndespite all the nonsense Rostopchfn wrote in \nhis broadsheets. They knew that it was for the \narmy to fight, and that if it could not succeed \nit would not do to take young ladies and house \nserfs to the Three Hills quarter of Moscow to \nfight Napoleon, and that they must go away, \nsorry as they were to abandon their property \n\n\n\n476 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nto destruction. They went away without think- \ning of the tremendous significance of that im- \nmense and wealthy city being given over to \ndestruction, for a great city with wooden build- \nings was certain when abandoned by its in- \nhabitants to be burned. They went away each \non his own account, and yet it was only in con- \nsequence of their going away that the momen- \ntous event was accomplished that will always \nremain the greatest glory of the Russian peo- \nple. The lady who, afraid of being stopped by \nCount Rostopchin's orders, had already in \nJune moved with her Negroes and her women \njesters from Moscow to her Saratov estate, with \na vague consciousness that she was not Bona- \nparte's servant, was really, simply, and truly \ncarrying out the great work which saved Russia. \nBut Count Rostopchin, who now taunted those \nwho left Moscow and now had the govern- \nment offices removed; now distributed quite \nuseless weapons to the drunken rabble; now \nhad processions displaying the icons, arid now \nforbade Father Augustin to remove icons or \nthe relics of saints; now seized all the private \ncarts in Moscow and on one hundred and \nthirty-six of them removed the balloon that \nwas being constructed by Leppich; now hinted \nthat he would burn Moscow and related how \nhe had set fire to his own house; now wrote a \nproclamation to the French solemnly upbraid- \ning them for having destroyed his Orphanage; \nnow claimed the glory of having hinted that \nhe would burn Moscow and now repudiated \nthe deed; now ordered the people to catch all \nspies and bring them to him, and now re- \nproached them for doing so; now expelled all \nthe French residents from Moscow, and now \nallowed Madame Aubert-Chalme' (the center \nof the whole French colony in Moscow) to re- \nmain, but ordered the venerable old postmas- \nter Klyucharev to be arrested and exiled for no \nparticular offense; now assembled the people \nat the Three Hills to fight the French and now, \nto get rid of them, handed over to them a man \nto be killed and himself drove away by a back \ngate; now declared that he would not survive \nthe fall of Moscow, and now wrote French \nverses in albums concerning his share in the \naffair this man did not understand the mean- \ning of what was happening but merely wanted \nto do something himself that would astonish \npeople, to perform some patriotically heroic \nfeat; and like a child he made sport of the mo- \nmentous and unavoidable event the abandon- \nment and burning of Moscow and tried with \nhis puny hand now to speed and now to stay \n\n\n\nthe enormous, popular tide that bore him \nalong with it. \n\nCHAPTER VI \n\nHEL&amp;NE, having returned with the court from \nVilna to Petersburg, found herself in a difficult \nposition. \n\nIn Petersburg she had enjoyed the special \nprotection of a grandee who occupied one of \nthe highest posts in the Empire. In Vilna she \nhad formed an intimacy with a young foreign \nprince. When she returned to Petersburg both \nthe magnate and the prince were there, and \nboth claimed their rights. He'lene was faced by \na new problem how to preserve her intimacy \nwith both without offending either. \n\nWhat would have seemed difficult or even \nimpossible to another woman did not cause \nthe least embarrassment to Countess Bezukho- \nva, who evidently deserved her reputation of \nbeing a very clever woman. Had she attempted \nconcealment, or tried to extricate herself from \nher awkward position by cunning, she would \nhave spoiled her case by acknowledging her- \nself guilty. But Hellene, like a really great man \nwho can do whatever he pleases, at once as- \nsumed her own position to be correct, as she \nsincerely believed it to be, and that everyone \nelse was to blame. \n\nThe first time the young foreigner allowed \nhirnselt to reproach her, she lifted her beauti- \nful head and, half turning to him, said firmly: \n"That's just like a man selfish and cruel! I \nexpected nothing else. A woman sacrifices her- \nself for you, she suffers, and this is her reward! \nWhat right have you, monseigneur, to demand \nan account of my attachments and friendships? \nHe is a man who has been more than a father \nto me I" The prince was about to say some- \nthing, but He'lene interrupted him. \n\n"Well, yes," said she, "it may be that he has \nother sentiments for me than those of a father, \nbut that is not a reason for me to shut my door \non him. I am not a man, that I should repay \nkindness with ingratitude! Know, monsei- \ngneur, that in all that relates to my intimate \nfeelings I render account only to God and to \nmy conscience," she concluded, layinghcr hand \non her beautiful, fully expanded bosom and \nlooking up to heaven. \n\n"But for heaven's sake listen to mel" \n\n"Marry me, and I will be your slavel" \n\n"But that's impossible." \n\n"You won't deign to demean yourself by \nmarrying me, you . . ." said He'lfcne, beginning \nto cry. \n\n\n\nThe prince tried to comfort her, but Hlene, \nas if quite distraught, said through her tears \nthat there was nothing to prevent her marry- \ning, that there were precedents (there were up \nto that time very few, but she mentioned Na- \npoleon and some other exalted personages), \nthat she had never been her husband's wife, \nand that she had been sacrificed. \n\n"But the law, religion . . .".said the prince, \nalready yielding. \n\n"The law, religion . . . What have they been \ninvented for if they can't arrange that?" said \n\n\n\nThe prince was surprised that so simple \nan idea had not occurred to him, and he ap- \nplied for advice to the holy brethren of the \nSociety of Jesus, with whom he was on inti- \nmate terms. \n\nA few days later at one of those enchanting \nfetes which Hlenc gave at her country house \non the Stone Island, the charming Monsieur \nde Jobert, a man no longer young, with snow- \nwhite hair and brilliant black eyes, a Jesuit d \nrobe courte, 1 was presented to her, and in the \ngarden by the light of the illuminations and to \nthe sound of music talked to her for a long \ntime of the love of God, of Christ, of the Sacred \nHeart, and of the consolations the one true \nCatholic religion affords in this world and the \nnext. Htf'lcne was touched, and more than once \ntears rose to her eyes and to those of Monsieur \nde Jobert and their voices trembled. A dance, \nfor which her partner came to seek her, put an \nend to her discourse with her future directeur \nde conscience, but the next evening Monsieur \nde Jobert came to see Helene when she was \nalone, and after that often came again. \n\nOne day he took the countess to a Roman \nCatholic church, where she knelt down before \nthe altar to which she was led. The enchant- \ning, middle-aged Frenchman laid his hands on \nher head and, as she herself afterward de- \nscribed it, she felt something like a fresh breeze \nwafted into her soul. It was explained to her \nthat this was la grdce. \n\nAfter that a long-frocked abb was brought \nto her. She confessed to him, and he absolved \nher from her sins. Next day she received a box \ncontaining the Sacred Host, which was left at \nher house for her to partake of. A few days \nlater Helene learned with pleasure that she \nhad now been admitted to the true Catholic \nChurch and that in a few days the Pope him- \nself would hear of her and would send her a \ncertain document. \n\n1 Lay member of the Society of Jesus. \n\n\n\nBOOK ELEVEN 477 \n\nAll that was done around her and to her at \nthis time, all the attention devoted to her by \nso many clever men and expressed in such \npleasant, refined ways, and the state of dove- \nlike purity she was now in (she wore only \nwhite dresses and white ribbons all that time) \ngave her pleasure, but her pleasure did not \ncause her for a moment to forget her aim. And \nas it always happens in contests of cunning \nthat a stupid person gets the better of cleverer \nones, Htflt-ne having realized that the main \nobject of all these words and all this trouble \nwas, after converting her to Catholicism, to \nobtain money from her for Jesuit institutions \n(as to which she received indications) before \nparting with her money insisted that the vari- \nous operations necessary to free her from her \nhusband should be performed. In her view the \naim of every religion was merely to preserve \ncertain proprieties while affording satisfaction \nto human desires. And with this aim, in one \nof her talks with her Father Confessor, she in- \nsisted on an answer to the question, in how far \nwas she bound by her marriage? \n\nThey were sitting in the twilight by a win- \ndow in the drawing room. The scent of flowers \ncame in at the window. Hc*lcne was wearing a \nwhite dress, transparent over her shoulders and \nbosom. The abbe*, a well-fed man with a plump, \nclean-shaven chin, a pleasant firm mouth, and \nwhite hands meekly folded on his knees, sat \nclose to Helene and, with a subtle smile on his \nlips and a peaceful look of delight at her \nbeauty, occasionally glanced at her face as he \nexplained his opinion on the subject. He*lene \nwith an uneasy smile looked at his curly hair \nand his plump, clean-shaven, blackish cheeks \nand every moment expected the conversation \nto take a fresh turn. But the abbe 1 , though he \nevidently enjoyed the beauty of his compan- \nion, was absorbed in his mastery of the matter. \n\nThe course of the Father Confessor's argu- \nments ran as follows: "Ignorant of the import \nof what you were undertaking, you made a \nvow of conjugal fidelity to a man who on his \npart, by entering the married state without \nfaith in the religious significance of marriage, \ncommitted an act of sacrilege. That marriage \nlacked the dual significance it should have had. \nYet in spite of this your vow was binding. You \nswerved from it. What did you commit by so \nacting? A venial, or a mortal, sin? A venial sin, \nfor you acted without evil intention. If now \nyou married again with the object of bearing \nchildren, your sin might be forgiven. But the \nquestion is again a twofold one: firstly . , ." \n\n\n\n478 \n\nBut suddenly Hlne, who was getting bored, \nsaid with one of her bewitching smiles: "But I \nthink that having espoused the true religion I \ncannot be bound by what a false religion laid \nupon me." \n\nThe director of her conscience was astounded \nat having the case presented to him thus with \nthe simplicity of Columbus' egg. He was de- \nlighted at the unexpected rapidity of his pu- \npil's progress, but could not abandon the edi- \nfice of argument he had laboriously constructed. \n\n"Let us understand one another, Countess," \nsaid he with a smile, and began refuting his \nspiritual daughter's arguments. \n\nCHAPTER VII \n\nHELENE UNDERSTOOD that the question was very \nsimple and easy from the ecclesiastical point \nof view, and that her directors were making \ndifficulties only because they were apprehen- \nsive as to how the matter would be regarded \nby the secular authorities. \n\nSo she decided that it was necessary to pre- \npare the opinion of society. She provoked the \njealousy of the elderly magnate and told him \nwhat she had told her other suitor; that is, she \nput the matter so that the only way for him to \nobtain a right over her was to marry her. The \nelderly magnate was at first as much taken \naback by this suggestion of marriage with a \nwoman whose husband was alive, as the young- \ner man had been, but He"lene's imperturbable \nconviction that it was as simple and natural as \nmarrying a maiden had its effect on him too. \nHad Hellene herself shown the least sign of \nhesitation, shame, or secrecy, her cause would \ncertainly have been lost; but not only did she \nshow no signs of secrecy or shame, on the con- \ntrary, with good-natured naivete she told her \nintimate friends (and these were all Peters- \nburg) that both the prince and the magnate \nhad proposed to her and that she loved both \nand was afraid of grieving either. \n\nA rumor immediately spread in Petersburg, \nnot that Helene wanted to be divorced from \nher husband (had such a report spread many \nwould have opposed so illegal an intention) \nbut simply that the unfortunate and interest- \ning Hellene was in doubt which of the two \nmen she should marry. The question was no \nlonger whether this was possible, but only \nwhich was the better match and how the mat- \nter would be regarded at court. There were, it \nis true, some rigid individuals unable to rise to \nthe height of such a question, who saw in the \nproject a desecration of the sacrament of mar- \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nriage, but there were not many such and they \nremained silent, while the majority were inter- \nested in Hellene's good fortune and in the \nquestion which match would be the more ad- \nvantageous. Whether it was right or wrong to \nremarry while one had a husband living they \ndid not discuss, for that question had evi- \ndently been settled by people "wiser than you \nor me," as they said, and to doubt the correct- \nness of that decision would be to risk exposing \none's stupidity and incapacity to live in society. \n\nOnly MArya Dmitrievna Akhrosimova, who \nhad come to Petersburg that summer to see \none of her sons, allowed herself plainly to ex- \npress an opinion contrary to the general one. \nMeeting Hellene at a ball she stopped her in \nthe middle of the room and, amid general si- \nlence, said in her gruff voice: "So wives of liv- \ning men have started marrying again! Perhaps \nyou think you have invented a novelty? You \nhave been forestalled, my dearl It was thought \nof long ago. It is done in all the brothels," and \nwith these words Mdrya Dmitrievna, turning \nup her wide sleeves with her usual threatening \ngesture and glancing sternly round, moved \nacross the room. \n\nThough people were afraid of Marya Dmi- \ntrievna she was regarded in Petersburg as a \nbuffoon, and so of what she had said they only \nnoticed, and repeated in a whisper, the one \ncoarse word she had used, supposing the whole \nsting of her remark to lie in that word. \n\nPrince Vasili, who of late very often forgot \nwhat he had said and repeated one and the \nsame thing a hundred times, remarked to his \ndaughter whenever he chanced to see her: \n\n"Helene, I have a word to say to you," and \nhe would lead her aside, drawing her hand \ndownward. "I have heard of certain projects \nconcerning . . . you know. Well, my dear child, \nyou know how your father's heart rejoices to \nknow that you . . . You have suffered so much. \n. . . But, my dear child, consult only your own \nheart. That is all I have to say," and conceal- \ning his unvarying emotion he would press his \ncheek against his daughter's and move away. \n\nBilfbin, who had not lost his reputation of \nan exceedingly clever man, and who was oneof \nthe disinterested friends so brilliant a woman \nas Helene always hasmen friends who can \nnever change into lovers once gave her his \nview of the matter at a small and intimate \ngathering. \n\n"Listen, Bilibin," said Helene (she always \ncalled friends of that sort by their surnames), \nand she touched his coat sleeve with her white, \n\n\n\nBOOK ELEVEN \n\n\n\n479 \n\n\n\nberinged fingers. "Tell me, as you would a \nsister, what I ought to do. Which of the two?" \n\nBilibin wrinkled up the skin over his eye- \nbrows and pondered, with a smile on his lips. \n\n"You are not taking me unawares, you know," \nsaid he. "As a true friend, I have thought and \nthought again about your affair. You see, if \nyou marry the prince" he meant the younger \nman and he crooked one finger, "you forever \nlose the chance of marrying the other, and you \nwill displease the court besides. (You know \nthere is some kind of connection.) But if you \nmarry the old count you will make his last \ndays happy, and as widow of the Grand . . . the \nprince would no longer be making a misalli- \nance by marrying you," and Bilfbin smoothed \nout his forehead. \n\n"That's a true friend I" said Hlene beam- \ning, and again touching Bilfbin's sleeve. "But \nI love them, you know, and don't want to dis- \ntress either of them. I would give my life for \nthe happiness of them both." \n\nBilibin shrugged his shoulders, as much as \nto say that not even he could help in that dif- \nficulty. \n\n"Unemaitresse-femme!* That's what is called \nputting things squarely. She would like to be \nmarried to all three at the same time," thought \nhe. \n\n"But tell me, how will your husband look \nat the matter?" Bilibin asked, his reputation \nbeing so well established that he did not fear \nto ask so naive a question. "Will he agree?" \n\n"Oh, he loves me so!" said Hlne, who for \nsome reason imagined that Pierre too loved \nher. "He will do anything for me." \n\nBilibin puckered his skin in preparation for \nsomething witty. \n\n"Even divorce you?" said he. \n\nHelene laughed. \n\nAmong those who ventured to doubt the \njustifiability of the proposed marriage was He 1 - \nlne's mother, Princess Kurdgina. She was con- \ntinually tormented by jealousy of her daugh- \nter, and now that jealousy concerned a sub- \nject near to her own heart, she could not rec- \noncile herself to the idea. She consulted a Rus- \nsian priest as to the possibility of divorce and \nremarriage during a husband's lifetime, and \nthe priest told her that it was impossible, and \nto her delight showed her a text in the Gospel \nwhich (as it seemed to him) plainly forbids \nremarriage while the husband is alive. \n\nArmed with these arguments, which ap- \npeared to her unanswerable, she drove to her \n\n1 A masterly woman. \n\n\n\ndaughter's early one morning so as to find her \nalone. \n\nHaving listened to her mother's objections, \nHelene smiled blandly and ironically. \n\n"But it says plainly: 'Whosoever shall marry \nher that is divorced . . .' " said the old prin- \ncess. \n\n"Ah, Maman, ne dites pas de bStises. Vous \nne comprenez rien. Dans ma position fat des \ndevoirs,"* said Helene changing from Rus- \nsian, in which language she always felt that \nher case did not sound quite clear, into French \nwhich suited it better. \n\n"But, my dear . . ." \n\n"Oh, Mamma, how is it you don't understand \nthat the Holy Father, who has the right to \ngrant dispensations . . ." \n\nJust then the lady companion who lived \nwith H^lene came in to announce that Hi? \nHighness was in the ballroom and wished tc \nsee her. \n\n"Non, dites-lui que je ne veux pas le voir \nque je suis furieuse centre lui&gt; parce qu'il m' c \nmanque parole" 8 \n\n"Comtesse, a tout peche misMcorde" * saic \na fair-haired young man with a long face anc \nnose, as he entered the room. \n\nThe old princess rose respectfully and curt \nsied. The young man who had entered took nc \nnotice of her. The princess nodded to hei \ndaughter and sidled out of the room. \n\n"Yes, she is right," thought the old princess \nall her convictions dissipated by the appear \nance of His Highness. "She is right, but how i: \nit that we in our irrecoverable youth did no \nknow it? Yet it is so simple," she thought as sru \ngot into her carriage. \n\nBy the beginning of August Hlne's affair \nwere clearly defined and she wrote a letter t&lt; \nher husbandwho, as she imagined, loved he \nvery much informing him of her intention t&lt; \nmarry N.N. and of her having embraced th&lt; \none true faith, and asking him to carry out al \ndie formalities necessary for a divorce, whicl \nwould be explained to him by the bearer o \nthe letter. \n\nAnd so I pray God to have you, my friend, ii \nHis holy and powerful keeping Your frien \nHcHene. \n\n8 "Oh, Mamma, don't talk nonsense! You don' \nunderstand anything. In my position I have obli \ngations." \n\n*"No, tell him I don't wish to see him, I ar \nfurious with him for not keeping his word to ine. \n* "Countess, there is mercy for every sin. \n\n\n\n480 \n\nThis letter was brought to Pierre's house \nwhen he was on the field of Borodin6. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII \n\nTOWARD THE END of the battle of Borodin6, \nPierre, having run down from Rae"vski's bat- \ntery a second time, made his way through a \ngully to Knyazk6vo with a crowd of soldiers, \nreached the dressing station, and seeing blood \nand hearing cries and groans hurried on, still \nentangled in the crowds of soldiers. \n\nThe one thing he now desired with his whole \nsoul was to get away quickly from the terrible \nsensations amid which he had lived that day \nand return to ordinary conditions of life and \nsleep quietly in a room in his own bed. He felt \nthat only in the ordinary conditions of life \nwould he be able to understand himself and \nall he had seen and felt. But such ordinary \nconditions of life were nowhere to be found. \n\nThough shells and bullets did not whistle \nover the road along which he was going, still \non all sides there was what there had been on \nthe field of battle. There were still the same \nsuffering, exhausted, and sometimes strangely \nindifferent faces, the same blood, the same sol- \ndiers' overcoats, the same sounds of firing \nwhich, though distant now, still aroused terror, \nand besides this there were the foul air and the \ndust. \n\nHaving gone a couple of miles along the \nMozhaysk road, Pierre sat down by the road- \nside. \n\nDusk had fallen, and the roar of guns died \naway. Pierre lay leaning on his elbow for a long \ntime, gazing at the shadows that moved past \nhim in the darkness. He was continually imag- \nining that a cannon ball was flying toward him \nwith a terrific whizz, and then he shuddered \nand sat up. He had no idea how long he had \nbeen there. In the middle of the night three \nsoldiers, having brought some firewood, set- \ntled down near him and began lighting a fire. \n\nThe soldiers, who threw sidelong glances at \nPierre, got the fire to burn and placed an iron \npot on it into which they broke some dried \nbread and put a little dripping. The pleasant \nodor of greasy viands mingled with the smell \nof smoke. Pierre sat up and sighed. The three \nsoldiers were eating and talking among them- \nselves, taking no notice of him. \n\n"And who may you be?" one of them sud- \ndenly asked Pierre, evidently meaning what \nPierre himself had in mind, namely: "If you \nwant to eat we'll give you some food, only let \nus know whether you are an honest man." \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n"I, I ..." said Pierre, feeling it necessary to \nminimize his social position as much as possi- \nble so as to be nearer to the soldiers and better \nunderstood by them. "By rights I am a militia \nofficer, but my men are not here. I came to the \nbattle and have lost them." \n\n"There now!" said one of the soldiers. \n\nAnother shook his head. \n\n"Would you like a little mash?" the first sol- \ndier asked, and handed Pierre a wooden spoon \nafter licking it clean. \n\nPierre sat down by the fire and began eating \nthe mash, as they called the food in the caul- \ndron, and he thought it more delicious than \nany food he had ever tasted. As he sat bending \ngreedily over it, helping himself to large spoon- \nfuls and chewing one after another, his face \nwas lit up by the fire and the soldiers looked \nat him in silence. \n\n"Where have you to go to? Tell us!" said \none of them. \n\n"To Mozhdysk." \n\n"You're a gentleman, aren't you?" \n\n"Yes." \n\n"And what's your name?" \n\n"Peter Kirilych." \n\n"Well then, Peter Kirilych, come along with \nus, we'll take you there." \n\nIn the total darkness the soldiers walked \nwith Pierre to Mozhdysk. \n\nBy the time they got near Mozhdysk and be- \ngan ascending the steep hill into the town, the \ncocks were already crowing. Pierre went on \nwith the soldiers, quite forgetting that his inn \nwas at the bottom of the hill and that he had \nalready passed it. He would not soon have re- \nmembered this, such was his state of forgetful- \nness, had he not halfway up the hill stumbled \nupon his groom, who had been to look for him \nin the town and was returning to the inn. The \ngroom recognized Pierre in the darkness by \nhis white hat. \n\n"Your excellency!" he said. "Why, we were \nbeginning to despair! How is it you are on \nfoot? And where are you going, please?" \n\n"Oh, yes!" said Pierre. \n\nThe soldiers stopped. \n\n"So you've found your folk?" said one of \nthem. "Well, good-by, Peter Kirilych-isn't it?" \n\n"Good-by, Peter Kirilychl" Pierre heard the \nother voices repeat. \n\n"Good-by!" he said and turned with his \ngroom toward the inn. \n\n"I ought to give them something!" he \nthought, and felt in his pocket. "No, better \nnotl" said another, inner voice. \n\n\n\nBOOK ELEVEN \n\n\n\n481 \n\n\n\nThere was not a room to be had at the inn, \nthey were all occupied. Pierre went out into \nthe yard and, covering himself up head and \nall, lay down in his carriage. \n\nCHAPTER IX \n\nSCARCELY HAD PIERRE laid his head on the pil- \nlow before he felt himself falling asleep, but \nsuddenly, almost with the distinctness of re- \nality, he heard the boom, boom, boom of fir- \ning, the thud of projectiles, groans and cries, \nand smelled blood and powder, and a feeling \nof horror and dread of death seized him. Filled \nwith fright he opened his eyes and lifted his \nhead from under his cloak. All was tranquil \nin the yard. Only someone's orderly passed \nthrough the gateway, splashing through the \nmud, and talked to the innkeeper. Above \nPierre's head some pigeons, disturbed by the \nmovement he had made in sitting up, fluttered \nunder the dark roof of the penthouse. The \nwhole courtyard was permeated by a strong \npeaceful smell of stable yards, delightful to \nPierre at that moment. He could see the clear \nstarry sky between the dark roofs of two pent- \nhouses. \n\n"Thank God, there is no more of that!" he \nthought, covering up his head again. "Oh, \nwhat a terrible thing is fear, and how shame- \nfully I yielded to it! But they . . . they were \nsteady and calm all the time, to the end . . ." \nthought he. \n\nThey, in Pierre's mind, were the soldiers, \nthose who had been at the battery, those who \nhad given him food, and those who had prayed \nbefore the icon. They, those strange men he \nhad not previously known, stood out clearly \nand sharply from everyone else. \n\n"To be a soldier, just a soldier!" thought \nPierre as he fell asleep, "to enter communal \nlife completely, to be imbued by what makes \nthem what they are. But how cast off all the \nsuperfluous, devilish burden of my outer man? \nThere was a time when I could have done it. I \ncould have run away from my father, as I \nwanted to. Or 1 might have been sent to serve \nas a soldier after the duel with D61okhov." \nAnd the memory of the dinner at the English \nClub when he hacl challenged Dolokhov flashed \nthrough Pierre's mind, and then he remem- \nbered his benefactor at Torzhok. And now a \npicture of a solemn meeting of the lodge pre- \nsented itself to his mind. It was taking place at \nthe English Club and someone near and dear \nto him sat at the end of the table. "Yes, that is \nhel It is my benefactor. But he died!" thought \n\n\n\nPierre. "Yes, he died, and I did not know he \nwas alive. How sorry I am that he died, and \nhow glad I am that he is alive again!" On one \nside of the table sat Anatole, Dolokhov, Nes- \nvftski, Denisov, and others like them (in his \ndream the category to which these men be- \nlonged was as clearly defined in his mind as \nthe category of those he termed they), and he \nheard those people, Anatole and Dolokhov, \nshouting and singing loudly; yet through their \nshouting the voice of his benefactor was heard \nspeaking all the time and the sound of his \nwords was as weighty and uninterrupted as the \nbooming on the battlefield, but pleasant and \ncomforting. Pierre did not understand what \nhis benefactor was saying, but he knew (the \ncategories of thoughts were also quite distinct \nin his dream) that he was talking of goodness \nand the possibility of being what they were. \nAnd they with their simple, kind, firm faces \nsurrounded his benefactor on all sides. But \nthough they were kindly they did not look at \nPierre and did not know him. Wishing to \nspeak and to attract their attention, he got up, \nbut at that moment his legs grew cold and \nbare. \n\nHe felt ashamed, and with one arm covered \nhis legs from whichhiscloakhad in factslipped. \nFor a moment as he was rearranging his cloak \nPierre opened his eyes and saw the same pent- \nhouse roofs, posts, and yard, but now they were \nall bluish, lit up, and glittering with frost or \ndew. \n\n"It is dawn," thought Pierre. "But that's not \nwhat I want. I want to hear and understand \nmy benefactor's words." Again he covered him- \nself up with his cloak, but now neither the \nlodge nor his benefactor was there. There were \nonly thoughts clearly expressed in words \nthoughts that someone was uttering or that he \nhimself was formulating. \n\nAfterwards when he recalled those thought? \nPierre was convinced that someone outside \nhimself had spoken them, though the impres \nsions of that day had evoked them. He had \nnever, it seemed to him, been able to think \nand express his thoughts like that when awake \n\n"To endure war is the most difficult subor \nd ination of man's freedom to the law of God/ \nthe voice had said. "Simplicity is submission tc \nthe will of God; you cannot escape from Him \nAnd they are simple. They do not talk, but act \nThe spoken word is silver but the unspoken ii \ngolden. Man can be master of nothing whil&lt; \nhe fears death, but he who does not fear it pos \nsesses all. If there were no suffering, man woulc \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nnot know his limitations, would not know \nhimself. The hardest thing [Pierre went on \nthinking, or hearing, in his dream] is to be \nable in your soul to unite the meaning of all. \nTo unite all?" he asked himself. "No, not to \nunite. Thoughts cannot be united, but to har- \nness all these thoughts together is what we \nneed! Yes, one must harness them, must har- \nness them!" he repeated to himself with in- \nward rapture, feeling that these words and they \nalone expressed what he wanted to say and \nsolved the question that tormented him. \n\n"Yes, one must harness, it is time to harness." \n\n"Time to harness, time to harness, your ex- \ncellency! Your excellency!" some voice was re- \npeating. "We must harness, it is time to har- \nness. . . ." \n\nIt was the voice of the groom, trying to wake \nhim. The sun shone straight into Pierre's face. \nHe glanced at the dirty innyard in the middle \nof which soldiers were watering their lean \nhorses at the pump while carts were passing \nout of the gate. Pierre turned away with re- \npugnance, and closing his eyes quickly fell \nback on the carriage seat. "No, I don't want \nthat, I don't want to see and understand that. \nI want to understand what was revealing itself \nto me in my dream. One second more and I \nshould have understood it all! But what am 1 \nto do? Harness, but how can I harness every- \nthing?" and Pierre felt with horror that the \nmeaning of all he had seen and thought in the \ndream had been destroyed. \n\nThe groom, the coachman, and the innkeep- \ner told Pierre that an officer had come with \nnews that the French were already near Moz- \nhiysk and that our men were leaving it. \n\nPierre got up and, having told them to har- \nness and overtake him, went on foot through \nthe town. \n\nThe troops were moving on, leaving about \nten thousand wounded behind them. There \nwere wounded in the yards, at the windows of \nthe houses, and the streets were crowded with \nthem. In the streets, around carts that were to \ntake some of the wounded away, shouts, curses, \nand blows could be heard. Pierre offered the \nuse of his carriage, which had overtaken him, \nto a wounded general he knew, and drove with \nhim to Moscow. On the way Pierre was told \nof the death of his brother-in-law Anatole and \nof that of Prince Andrew. \n\nCHAPTER X \n\nON THE THIRTIETH OF AUGUST Pierre reached \nMoscow. Close to the gates of the city he was \n\n\n\nmet by Count Rostopchfn's adjutant. \n\n"We have been looking for you everywhere," \nsaid the adjutant. "The count wants to see you \nparticularly. He asks you to come to him at \nonce on a very important matter." \n\nWithout going home Pierre took a cab and \ndrove to see the Moscow commander in chief. \n\nCount Rostopchfn had only that morning \nreturned to town from his summer villa at So- \nk61niki. The anteroom and reception room of \nhis house were full of officials who had been \nsummoned or had come for orders. Vasflchi- \nkov and Pldtov had already seen the count and \nexplained to him that it was impossible to de- \nfend MoscoW and that it would have to be sur- \nrendered. Though this news was being con- \ncealed from the inhabitants, the officialsthe \nheads of the various government departments \nknew that Moscow would soon be in the en- \nemy's hands, just as Count Rostopchin himself \nknew it, and to escape personal responsibility \nthey had all come to the governor to ask how \nthey were to deal with their various depart- \nments. \n\nAs Pierre was entering the reception room \na courier from the army came out of Rostop- \nchin's private room. \n\nIn answer to questions with which he was \ngreeted, the courier made a despairing gesture \nwith his hand and passed through the room. \n\nWhile waiting in the reception room Pierre \nwith weary eyes watched the various officials, \nold and young, military and civilian, who were \nthere. They all seemed dissatisfied and uneasy. \nPierre went up to a group of men, one of \nwhom he knew. After greeting Pierre they con- \ntinued their conversation. \n\n"If they're sent out and brought back again \nlater on it will do no harm, but as things are \nnow one can't answer for anything." \n\n"But you see what he writes . . ." said an- \nother, pointing to a printed sheet he held in \nhis hand. \n\n"That's another matter. That's necessary for \nthe people," said the first. \n\n"What is it?" asked Pierre. \n\n"Oh, it's a fresh broadsheet." \n\nPierre took it and began reading. \n\nHis Serene Highness has passed through Moz- \nhiysk in order to join up with the troops moving \ntoward him and has taken up a strong position \nwhere the enemy will not soon attack him. Forty- \neight guns with ammunition have been sent him \nfrom here, and his Serene Highness says he will \ndefend Moscow to the last drop of blood and is \neven ready to fight in the streets. Do not be upset, \n\n\n\nbrothers, that the law courts are closed; things \nhave to be put in order, and we will deal with vil- \nlains in our own way! When the time comes I shall \nwant both town and peasant lads and will raise \nthe cry a day or two beforehand, but they are not \nwanted yet so I hold my peace. An ax will be use- \nful, a hunting spear not bad, but a three-pronged \nfork will be best of all: a Frenchman is no heavier \nthan a sheaf of rye. Tomorrow after dinner I shall \ntake the Iberian icon of the Mother of God to the \nwounded in the Catherine Hospital where we will \nhave some water blessed. That will help them to \nget well quicker. I, too, am well now: one of my \neyes was sore but now I am on the lookout with \nboth. \n\n"But military men have told me that it is \nimpossible to fight in the town/' said Pierre, \n"and that the position . . ." \n\n"Well, of course! That's what we were say- \ning," replied the first speaker. \n\n"And what does he mean by 'One of my \neyes was sore but now I am on the lookout with \nboth'?" asked Pierre. \n\n"The count had a sty," replied the adjutant \nsmiling, "and was very much upset when I told \nhim people had come to ask what was the mat- \nter with him. By the by, Count," he added \nsuddenly, addressing Pierre with a smile, "we \nheard that you have family troubles and that \nthe countess, your wife . . ." \n\n"I have heard nothing," Pierre replied un- \nconcernedly. "But what have you heard?" \n\n"Oh, well, you know people often invent \nthings. I only say what I heard." \n\n"But what did you hear?" \n\n"Well, they say," continued the adjutant \nwith the same smile, "that the countess, your \nwife, is preparing to go abroad. I expect it's \nnonsense. . . ." \n\n"Possibly," remarked Pierre, looking about \nhim absent-mindedly. "And who is that?" he \nasked, indicating a short old man in a clean \nblue peasant overcoat, with a big snow-white \nbeard and eyebrows and a ruddy face. \n\n"He? That's a tradesman, that is to say, he's \nthe restaurant keeper, Vereshchdgin. Perhaps \nyou have heard of that affair with the procla- \nmation." \n\n"Oh, so that is Vereshchgin!" said Pierre, \nlooking at the firm, calm face of the old man \nand seeking any indication of his being a \ntraitor. \n\n"That's not he himself, that's the father of \nthe fellow who wrote the proclamation," said \nthe adjutant. "The young man is in prison \nand I expect it will go hard with him." \n\nAn old gentleman wearing a star and anoth- \n\n\n\nBOOK ELEVEN 483 \n\ner official, a German wearing a cross round his \n\n\n\nneck, approached the speaker. \n\n"It's a complicated story, you know," said \nthe adjutant. "That proclamation appeared \nabout two months ago. The count was in- \nformed of it. He gave orders to investigate the \nmatter. Gabriel Ivdnovich here made the in- \nquiries. The proclamation had passed through \nexactly sixty-three hands. He asked one, 'From \nwhom did you get it?' 'From so-and-so.' He went \nto the next one. 'From whom did you get it?' \nand so on till he reached Vereshch^gin, a half- \neducated tradesman, you know, 4 a pet of a \ntrader,' " said the adjutant smiling. "They \nasked him, 'Who gave it you?' And the point is \nthat we knew whom he had it from. He could \nonly have had it from the Postmaster. But evi- \ndently they had come to some understanding. \nHe replied: 'From no one; I made it up my- \nself.' They threatened and questioned him, \nbut he stuck to that: 'I made it up myself.' And \nso it was reported to the count, who sent for \nthe man. 'From whom did you get the procla- \nmation?' 'I wrote it myself.' Well, you know \nthe count," said the adjutant cheerfully, with a \nsmile of pride, "he flared up dreadfullyand \njust think of the fellow's audacity, lying, and \nobstinacy!" \n\n"And the count wanted him to say it was \nfrom Klyucharev? I understand!" said Pierre. \n\n"Not at all," rejoined the adjutant in dis- \nmay. "Klyucharev had his own sins to answer \nfor without that and that is why he has been \nbanished. But the point is that the count was \nmuch annoyed. 'How could you have written \nit yourself?' said he, arid he took up the Ham- \nburg Gazette that was lying on the table. \n'Here it is! You did not write it yourself but \ntranslated it, and translated it abominably, be- \ncause you don't even know French, you fool.' \nAnd what do you think? 'No,' said he, 'I have \nnot read any papers, I made it up myself.' 'If \nthat's so, you're a traitor and I'll have you \ntried, and you'll be hanged! Say from whom \nyou had it.' 'I have seen no papers, I made it \nup myself.' And that was the end of it. The \ncount had the father fetched, but the fellow \nstuck to it. He was sent for trial and con- \ndemned to hard labor, I believe. Now the fa- \nther has come to intercede for him. But he's a \ngood-for-nothing lad! You know that sort of \ntradesman's son, a dandy and lady-killer. He \nattended some lectures somewhere and imag- \nines that the devil is no match for him. That's \nthe sort of fellow he is. His father keeps a cook- \nshop here by the Stone Bridge, and you know \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nthere was a large icon of God Almighty painted \nwith a scepter in one hand and an orb in the \nother. Well, he took that icon home with him \nfor a few days and what did he do? He found \nsome scoundrel of a painter . . ." \n\nCHAPTER XI \n\nIN THE MIDDLE of this fresh talc Pierre was \nsummoned to the commander in chief. \n\nWhen he entered the private room Count \nRostopchin, puckering his face, was rubbing \nhis forehead and eyes with his hand. A short \nman was saying something, but when Pierre \nentered he stopped speaking and went out. \n\n"Ah, how do you do, great warrior?" said \nRostopchin as soon as the short man had left \nthe room. "We have heard of your prowess. \nBut that's not the point. Between ourselves, \nmon cher, do you belong to the Masons?" he \nwent on severely, as though there were some- \nthing wrong about it which he nevertheless \nintended to pardon. Pierre remained silent. "I \nam well informed, my friend, but I am aware \nthat there are Masons and Masons and I hope \nthat you are not one of those who on pretense \nof saving mankind wish to ruin Russia." \n\n"Yes, I am a Mason," Pierre replied. \n\n"There, you see, mon cher! I expect you \nknow that Messrs. Spcranski and Magnitski \nhave been deported to their proper place. Mr. \nKlyucharev has been treated in the same way, \nand so have others who on the plea of building \nup the temple of Solomon have tried to de- \nstroy the temple of their fatherland. You can \nunderstand that there are reasons for this and \nthat I could not have exiled the Postmaster \nhad he not been a harmful person. It has now \ncome to my knowledge that you lent him your \ncarriage for his removal from town, and that \nyou have even accepted papers from him for \nsafe custody. I like you and don't wish you any \nharm and as you are only half my age I ad- \nvise you, as a father would, to cease all com- \nmunication with men of that stamp and to \nleave here as soon as possible." \n\n"But what did Klyucharevdo wrong, Count?" \nasked Pierre. \n\n"That is for me to know, but not for you to \nask," shouted Rostopchfn. \n\n"If he is accused of circulating Napoleon's \nproclamation it is not proved that he did so," \nsaid Pierre without looking at Rostopchfn, "and \nVereshchdgin ..." \n\n"There we are!" Rostopchin shouted at \nPierre louder than before, frowning suddenly. \n"Vereshch^gin is a renegade and a traitor who \n\n\n\nwill be punished as he deserves," said he with \nthe vindictive heat with which people speak \nwhen recalling an insult. "But I did not sum- \nmon you to discuss my actions, but to give you \nadvice or an order if you prefer it. I beg you \nto leave the town and break off all communica- \ntion with such men as Klyucharev. And I will \nknock the nonsense outof anybody" but prob- \nably rcali/ing that he was shouting at Beziik- \nhov who so far was not guilty of anything, he \nadded, taking Pierre's hand in a friendly man- \nner, "We arc on the eve of a public disaster \nand I haven't time to be polite to everybody \nwho has business with me. My head is some- \ntimes in a whirl. Well, mon cher, what are you \ndoing personally?" \n\n"Why, nothing," answered Pierre without \nraising his eyes or changing the thoughtful ex- \npression of his face. \n\nThe count frowned. \n\n"A word of friendly advice, mon cher. Be off \nas soon as you can, that's all I have to tell you. \nHappy he who has ears to hear. Good-by, my \ndear fellow. Oh, by the by! "he shouted through \nthe doorway after Pierre, "is it true that the \ncountess has fallen into the clutches of the \nholy fathers of the Society of Jesus?" \n\nPierre did not answer and left Rostopchfn's \nroom more sullen and angry than he had ever \nbefore shown himself. \n\nWhen he reached home it was already get- \nting dark. Some eight people had come to see \nhim that evening: thesecretary of a committee, \nthe colonel of his battalion, his steward, his \nmajor-domo, and various petitioners. They all \nhad business with Pierre and wanted decisions \nfrom him. Pierre did not understand and was \nnot interested in any of these questions and \nonly answered them in order to get rid of these \npeople. When left alone at last he opened and \nread his wife's letter. \n\n"They, the soldiers at the battery, Prince \nAndrew killed . . . that old man . . . Simplicity \nis submission to God. Suffering is necessary . . . \nthe meaning of all ... one must harness . . . \nmy wife is getting married . . . One must for- \nget and understand . . ." And going to his bed \nhe threw himself on it without undressing and \nimmediately fell asleep. \n\nWhen he awoke next morning the major- \ndomo came to inform him that a special mes- \nsenger, a police officer, had come from Count \nRostopchin to know whether Count Beziikhov \nhad left or was leaving the town. \n\nA dozen persons who had business with \nPierre were awaiting him in the drawing room. \n\n\n\nBOOK ELEVEN \n\n\n\n485 \n\n\n\nPierre dressed hurriedly and, instead of going \nto see them, went to the back porch and out \nthrough the gate. \n\nFrom that time till the end of the destruc- \ntion of Moscow no one of Beziikhov's house- \nhold, despite all the search they made, saw \nPierre again or knew where he was. \n\nCHAPTER XII \n\nTHE Ros'i6vs remained in Moscow till the first \nof September, that is, till the eve of the en- \nemy's entry into the city. \n\nAfter P(kya had joined Oboldnski's regi- \nment of Cossacks and left for Belaya Tserkov \nwhere that regiment was forming, the countess \nwas seized with terror. The thought that both \nher sons were at the war, had both gone from \nunder her wing, that today or tomorrow either \nor both of them might be killed like the three \nsons of one of her acquaintances, struck her \nthat summer for the first time with cruel clear- \nness. She tried to get Nicholas back and wished \nto go herself to join P(kya, or to get him an ap- \npointment somewhere in Petersburg, but nei- \nther of these proved possible. Ptya could not \nreturn unless his regiment did so or unless he \nwas transferred to another regiment on active \nservice. Nicholas was somewhere with the army \nand had not sent a word since his last letter, in \nwhich he had given a detailed account of his \nmeeting with Princess Mary. The countess did \nnot sleep at night, or when she did fall asleep \ndreamed that she saw her sons lying dead. Aft- \ner many consultations and conversations, the \ncount at last devised means to tranquillize her. \nHe got Ptya transferred from Obolenski's regi- \nment to Beziikhov's, which was in training \nnear Moscow. Though Pd-tya would remain in \nthe service, this transfer would give the coun- \ntess the consolation of seeing at least one of \nher sons under her wing, and she hoped to ar- \nrange matters for her P(hya so as not to let him \ngo again, but always get him appointed to \nplaces where he could not possibly take part \nin a battle. As long as Nicholas alone was in \ndanger the countess imagined that she loved \nher first-born more than all her other children \nand even reproached herself for it; but when \nher youngest: the scapegrace who had been \nbad at lessons, was always breaking things in \nthe house and making himself a nuisance to \neverybody, that snub-nosed Ptya with his \nmerry black eyes and fresh rosy cheeks where \nsoft down was just beginning to show when \nhe was thrown amid those big, dreadful, cruel \nmen who were fighting somewhere about some- \n\n\n\nthing and apparently finding pleasure in it- \nthen his mother thought she loved him more, \nmuch more, than all her other children. The \nnearer the time came for Ptya to return, the \nmore uneasy grew the countess. She began to \nthink she would never live to see such happi- \nness. The presence of Sonya, of her beloved \nNatasha, or even of her husband irritated her. \n"What do I want with them? I want no one \nbut P6tya," she thought. \n\nAt the end of August the Rost6vs received \nanother letter from Nicholas. He wrote from \nthe province ot Vor6nezh where he had been \nsent to procure remounts, but that letter did \nriot set the countess at ease. Knowing that one \nson was out of danger she became the more \nanxious about Ptya. \n\nThough by the twentieth of August nearly \nall the Rostovs' acquaintances had left Mos- \ncow, and though everybody tried to persuade \nthe countess to get away as quickly as possible, \n.she would not hear of leaving before her treas- \nure, her adored Pe*tya, returned. On the twenty- \neighth of August he arrived. The passionate \ntenderness with which his mother received \nhim did not please the sixteen-year-old officer. \nThough she concealed from him her intention \nof keeping him under her wing, Petya guessed \nher designs, and instinctively fearing that he \nmight give way to emotion when with her \nmight "become womanish" as he termed it to \nhimselfhe treated her coldly, avoided her, \nand during his stay in Moscow attached him- \nself exclusively to Natasha for whom he had al- \nways had a particularly brotherly tenderness, \nalmost lover-like. \n\nOwing to the count's customary carelessness \nnothing was ready for their departure by the \ntwenty-eighth of August and the carts that \nwere to come from their Ryazdn and Moscow \nestates to remove their household belongings \ndid not arrive till the thirtieth. \n\nFrom the twenty-eighth till the thirty- first \nall Moscow was in a bustle and commotion. \nEvery day thousands of men wounded at Boro- \ndin6 were brought in by the Dorogomilov gate \nand taken to various parts of Moscow, and \nthousands of carts conveyed the inhabitants \nand their possessions out by the other gates. \nIn spite of Rostopchfn's broadsheets, or be- \ncause of them or independently of them, the \nstrangest and most contradictory rumors were \ncurrent in the town. Some said that no one was \nto be allowed to leave the city, others on the \ncontrary said that all the icons had been taken \nout of the churches and everybody was to be \n\n\n\n486 WAR AND \n\nordered to leave. Some said there had been an- \nother battle after Borodino at which the French \nhad been routed, while others on the contrary \nreported that the Russian army had been de- \nstroyed. Some talked about the Moscow militia \nwhich, preceded by the clergy, would go to the \nThree Hills; others whispered that Augustin * \nhad been forbidden to leave, that traitors had \nbeen seized, that the peasants were rioting and \nrobbing people on their way from Moscow, \nand so on. But all this was only talk; in reality \n(though the Council of Filf, at which it was \ndecided to abandon Moscow, had not yet been \nheld) both those who went away and those who \nremained behind felt, though they did not \nshow it, that Moscow would certainly be aban- \ndoned, and that they ought to get away as \nquickly as possible and save their belongings. \nIt was felt that everything would suddenly \nbreak up and change, but up to the first of \nSeptember nothing had done so. As a criminal \nwho is being led to execution knows that he \nmust die immediately, but yet looks about him \nand straightens the cap that is awry on his \nhead, so Moscow involuntarily continued its \nwonted life, though it knew that the time of its \ndestruction was near when the conditions of \nlife to which its people were accustomed to \nsubmit would be completely upset. \n\nDuring the three days preceding the occupa- \ntion of Moscow the whole Rostov family was \nabsorbed in various activities. The head of the \nfamily, Count Ilyd Rost6v, continually drove \nabout the city collecting the current rumors \nfrom all sides and gave superficial and hasty \norders at home about the preparations for their \ndeparture. \n\nThe countess watched the things being \npacked, was dissatisfied with everything, was \nconstantly in pursuit of Ptya who was always \nrunning away from her, and was jealous of \nNatisha with whom he spent all his time. S6n- \nya alone directed the practical side of matters \nby getting things packed. But of late S6nya \nhad been particularly sad and silent. Nicholas' \nletter in which he mentioned Princess Mary \nhad elicited, in her presence, joyous comments \nfrom the countess, who saw an intervention of \nProvidence in this meeting of the princess and \nNicholas. \n\n"I was never pleased at Bolk6nski's engage- \nment to Natdsha," said the countess, "but I al- \nways wanted Nicholas to marry the princess, \nand had a presentiment that it would happen. \nWhat a good thing it would bel" \n\n1 Archbishop of Moscow. TR. \n\n\n\nPEACE \n\nS6nya felt that this was true: that the only \npossibility of retrieving the Rostovs' affairs was \nby Nicholas marrying a rich woman, and that \nthe princess was a good match. It was very bit- \nter for her. But despite her grief, or perhaps \njust because of it, she took on herself all the \ndifficult work of directing the storingand pack- \ning of their things and was busy for whole days. \nThe count and countess turned to her when \nthey had any orders to give. Ptya and Nata- \nsha on the contrary, far from helping their \nparents, were generally a nuisance and a hin- \ndrance to everyone. Almost all day long the \nhouse resounded with their running feet, their \ncries, and their spontaneous laughter. They \nlaughed and were gay not because there was \nany reason to laugh, but because gaiety and \nmirth were in their hearts and so everything \nthat happened was a cause for gaiety and \nlaughter to them. P&lt;hya was in high spirits be- \ncause having left home a boy he had returned \n(as everybody told him) a fine young man, be- \ncause he was at home, because he had left Be*- \nlaya Tscrkov where there was no hope of soon \ntaking part in a battle and had come to Mos- \ncow where there was to be fighting in a few \ndays, and chiefly because Natdsha, whose lead \nhe always followed, was in high spirits. Nata- \nsha was gay because she had been sad too long \nand now nothing reminded her of the cause of \nher sadness, and because she was feeling well. \nShe was also happy because she had someone \nto adore her: the adoration of others was a \nlubricant the wheels of her machine needed to \nmake them run freely and Pchya adored her. \nAbove all, they were gay because there was a \nwar near Moscow, there would be fighting at \nthe town gates, arms were being given out, \neverybody was escaping going away some- \nwhere, and in general something extraordinary \nwas happening, and that is always exciting, \nespecially to the young. \n\nCHAPTER XIII \n\nON SATURDAY, the thirty-first of August, every- \nthing in the Rost6vs' house seemed topsy-turvy. \nAll the doors were open, all the furniture was \nbeing carried out or moved about, and the \nmirrors and pictures had been taken down. \nThere were trunks in the rooms, and hay, \nwrapping paper, and ropes were scattered \nabout. The peasants and house serfs carrying \nout the things were treading heavily on the \nparquet floors. The yard was crowded with \npeasant carts, some loaded high and already \ncorded up, others still empty. \n\n\n\nBOOK ELEVEN \n\n\n\n487 \n\n\n\nThe voices and footsteps of the many serv- \nants and of the peasants -who had come with \nthe carts resounded as they shouted to one an- \nother in the yard and in the house. The count \nhad been out since morning. The countess had \na headache brought on by all the noise and \nturmoil and was lying down in the new sitting \nroom with a vinegar compress on her head. \nPdtya was not at home, he had gone to visit a \nfriend with whom he meant to obtain a trans- \nfer from the militia to the active army. S6nya \nwas in the ballroom looking after the packing \nof the glass and china. Natdsha was sitting on \nthe floor of her dismantled room with dresses, \nribbons, and scarves strewn all about her, gaz- \ning fixedly at the floor and holding in her \nhands the old ball dress (already out of fash- \nion) which she had worn at her first Petersburg \nball. \n\nNatasha was ashamed of doing nothing when \neveryone else was so busy, and several times \nthat morning had tried to set to work, but her \nheart was not in it, and she could not and did \nnot know how to do anything except with all \nher heart and all her might. For a while she \nhad stood beside S6nya while the china was \nbeing packed and tried to help, but soon gave \nit up and went to her room to pack her own \nthings. At first she found it amusing to give \naway dresses and ribbons to the maids, but \nwhen that was done and what was left had still \nto be packed, she found it dull. \n\n"Dunydsha, you packl You will, won't you, \ndear?" And when Dunydsha willingly prom- \nised to do it all for her, Natasha sat down on \nthe floor, took her old ball dress, and fell into \na reverie quite unrelated to what ought to \nhave occupied her thoughts now. She was \nroused from her reverie by the talk of the maids \nin the next room (which was theirs) and by \nthe sound of their hurried footsteps going to \nthe back porch. Natdsha got up and looked \nout of the window. An enormously long row \nof carts full of wounded men had stopped in \nthe street. \n\nThe housekeeper, the old nurse, the cooks, \ncoachmen, maids, footmen, postilions, and \nscullions stood at the gate, staring at the \nwounded. \n\nNatdsha, throwing a clean pocket handker- \nchief over her hair and holding an end of it in \neach hand, went out into the street. \n\nThe former housekeeper, old Mdvra Kuz- \nminichna, had stepped out of the crowd by \nthe gate, gone up to a cart with a hood con- \nstructed of bast mats, and was speaking to a \n\n\n\npale young officer who lay inside. Natdsha \nmoved a few steps forward and stopped shyly, \nstill holding her handkerchief, and listened to \nwhat the housekeeper was saying. \n\n"Then you have nobody in Moscow?" she \nwas saying. "You would be more comfortable \nsomewhere in a house ... in ours, for instance \n. . . the family are leaving." \n\n"I don't know if it would be allowed," re- \nplied the officer in a weak voice. "Here is our \ncommanding officer . . . ask him," and he \npointed to a stout major who was walking back \nalong the street past the row of carts. \n\nNatdsha glanced with frightened eyes at the \nface of the wounded officer and at once went \nto meet the major. \n\n"May the wounded men stay in our house?" \nshe asked. \n\nThe major raised his hand to his cap with a \nsmile. \n\n"Which one do you want, Ma'am'selle?"said \nhe, screwing up his eyes and smiling. \n\nNatdsha quietly repeated her question, and \nher face and whole manner were so serious, \nthough she was still holding the ends of her \nhandkerchief, that the major ceased smiling \nand after some reflection as if considering in \nhow far the thing was possiblereplied in the \naffirmative. \n\n"Oh yes, why not? They may," he said. \nWith a slight inclination of her head, Natd- \nsha stepped back quickly to Mdvra Kuzminich- \nna, who stood talking compassionately to the \nofficer. \n\n"They may. He says they mayl" whispered \nNatdsha. \n\nThe cart in which the officer lay was turned \ninto the Rostovs* yard, and dozens of carts \nwith wounded men t&gt;egan at the invitation of \nthe townsfolk ttf turn into the yards and to \ndraw up at the entrances of the houses in Po- \nvarskdya Street. Natdsha was evidently pleased \nto be dealing with new people outside the ordi- \nnary routine of her life. She and Mdvra Kuz- \nminichna tried to get as many of the wounded \nas possible into their yard. \n\n"Your Papa must be told, though," said Md- \nvra Kuzminichna. \n\n"Never mind, never mind, what does it mat- \nter? For one day we can move into the draw- \ning room. They can have all our half of the \nhouse." \n\n"There now, young lady, you do take things \ninto your head! Even if we put them into the \nwing, the men's room, or the nurse's room, we \nmust ask permission." \n\n\n\n488 \n\n"Well, I'll ask." \n\nNatdsha ran into the house and went on tip- \ntoe through the half-open door into the sitting \nroom, where there was a smell of vinegar and \nHoffman's drops. 1 \n\n"Are you asleep, Mamma?" \n\n"Oh, what sleep?" said the countess, \nwaking up just as she was dropping into a \ndoze. \n\n"Mamma darlingl" said Natdsha, kneeling \nby her mother and bringing her face close to \nher mother's, "I am sorry, forgive me, I'll nev- \ner do it again; I woke you up! Mavra Kuzmfn- \nichna has sent me: they have brought some \nwounded here officers. Will you let them \ncome? They have nowhere to go. I knew you'd \nlet them come . . ." she said quickly all in one \nbreath. \n\n"What officers? Whom have they brought? I \ndon't understand anything about it," said the \ncountess. \n\nNatdsha laughed, and the countess too smiled \nslightly. \n\n"I knew you'd give permission ... so I'll tell \nthem," and, having kissed her mother, Nata- \nsha got up and went to the door. \n\nIn the hall she met her father, who had re- \nturned with bad news. \n\n"We've stayed too long! "said the count with \ninvoluntary vexation. "The Club is closed and \nthe police are leaving." \n\n"Papa, is it all right I've invited some of \nthe wounded into the house?" said Natdsha. \n\n"Of course it is," he answered absently. \n"That's not the point. I beg you not to indulge \nin trifles now, but to help to pack, and tomor- \nrow we must go, go, go! . . ." \n\nAnd the count gave a similar order to the \nmajor-domo and the servants. \n\nAt dinner Ptya having returned home told \nthem the news he had heard. He said the peo- \nple had been getting arms in the Kremlin, and \nthat though Rostopchin's broadsheet had said \nthat he would sound a call two or three days \nin advance, the order had certainly already \nbeen given for everyone to go armed to the \nThree Hills tomorrow, and that there would \nbe a big battle there. \n\nThe countess looked with timid horror at \nher son's eager, excited face as he said this. She \nrealized that if she said a word about his not \ngoing to the battle (she knew he enjoyed the \nthought of the impending engagement) he \nwould say something about men, honor, and \nthe fatherland something senseless, masculine, \n\n1 A medicine much used in Russia. TR. \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\nand obstinate which there would be no con- \ntradicting, and her plans would be spoiled; \nand so, hoping to arrange to leave before then \nand take Pe* tya with her as their protector and \ndefender, she did not answer him, but after \ndinner called the count aside and implored \nhim with tears to take her away quickly, that \nvery night if possible. With a woman's invol- \nuntary loving cunning she, who till then had \nnot shown any alarm, said that she would die \nof fright if they did not leave that very night. \nWithout any pretense she was now afraid of \neverything. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV \n\nMADAME SCHOSS, who had been out to visit her \ndaughter, increased the countess' fears still \nmore by telling what she had seen at a spirit \ndealer's in Myasnftski Street. When returning \nby that street she had been unable to pass be- \ncause of a drunken crowd rioting in front of \nthe shop. She had taken a cab and driven home \nby a side street and the cabman had told her \nthat the people were breaking open the bar- \nrels at the drink store, having received orders \nto do so. \n\nAfter dinner the whole Rost6v household \nset to work with enthusiastic haste packing \ntheir belongings and preparing for their de- \nparture. The old count, suddenly setting to \nwork, kept passing from the yard to the house \nand back again, shouting confused instructions \nto the hurrying people, and flurrying themstill \nmore. Pctya directed things in the yard. S6nya, \nowing to the count's contradictory orders, lost \nher head and did not know what to do. The \nservants ran noisily about the house and yard, \nshouting and disputing. Natdsha, with the ar- \ndor characteristic of all she did, suddenly set \nto work too. At first her intervention in the \nbusiness of packing was received skeptically. \nEverybody expected some prank from her and \ndid not wish to obey her; but she resolutely \nand passionately demanded obedience, grew \nangry and nearly cried because they did not \nheed her, and at last succeeded in making them \nbelieve her. Her first exploit, which cost her \nimmense effort and established her authority, \nwas the packing of the carpets. The count had \nvaluable Gobelin tapestries and Persian carpets \nin the house. When Natdsha set to work two \ncases were standing open in the ballroom, one \nalmost full up with crockery, the other with \ncarpets. There was also much china standing \non the tables, and still more was being brought \n\n\n\nBOOK ELEVEN \n\nin from the storeroom. A third case was needed \nand servants had gone to fetch it. \n\n"S6nya, wait a bit we'll pack everything in- \nto these," said Natdsha. \n\n"You can't, Miss, we have tried to," said the \nbutler's assistant. \n\n"No, wait a minute, please." \n\nAnd Natdsha began rapidly taking out of \nthe case dishes and plates wrapped in paper. \n\n"The dishes must go in here among the car- \npets," said she. \n\n"Why, it's a mercy if we can get the carpets \nalone into three cases," said the butler's assist- \nant. \n\n"Oh, wait, please!" And Natdsha began \nrapidly and deftly sorting out the things. \n"These aren't needed," said she, putting aside \nsome plates of Kiev ware. "These yes, these \nmust go among the carpets," she said, referring \nto the Saxony china dishes. \n\n"Don't, Natdsha! Leave it alone! We'll get \nit all packed," urged S6nya reproachfully. \n\n"What a young lady she is!" remarked the \nmajor-domo. \n\nBut Natdsha would not give in. She turned \neverything out and began quickly repacking, \ndeciding that the inferior Russian carpets and \nunnecessary crockery should not be taken at \nall. When everything had been taken out of \nthe cases, they recommenced packing, and it \nturned out that when the cheaper things not \nworth taking had nearly all been rejected, the \nvaluable ones really did all go into the two \ncases. Only the lid of the case containing the \ncarpets would not shut down. A few more \nthings might have been taken out, but Natd- \nsha insisted on having her own way. She \npacked, repacked, pressed, made the butler's \nassistant and P^tya whom she had drawn in- \nto the business of packing press on the lid, \nand made desperate efforts herself. \n\n"That's enough, Natdsha," said S6nya. "I \nsee you were right, but just take out the top \none." \n\n"I won't!" cried Natdsha, with one hand \nholding back the hair that hung over her per- \nspiring face, while with the other she pressed \ndown the carpets. "Now press, Pe'tya! Press, \nVasflich, press hard!" she cried. \n\nThe carpets yielded and the lid closed; Na- \ntdsha, clapping her hands, screamed with de- \nlight and tears fell from her eyes. But this only \nlasted a moment. She at once set to work afresh \nand they now trusted her completely. The \ncount was not angry even when they told him \nthat Natdsha had countermanded an order of \n\n\n\n489 \n\nhis, and the servants now came to her to ask \nwhether a cart was sufficiently loaded, and \nwhether it might be corded up. Thanks to Na- \ntasha's directions the work now Tvent on ex- \npeditiously, unnecessary things were left, and \nthe most valuable packed as compactly as pos- \nsible. \n\nBut hard as they all worked till quite late \nthat night, they could not get everything \npacked. The countess had fallen asleep and \nthe count, having put off their departure till \nnext morning, went to bed. \n\nS6nya and Natasha slept in the sitting room \nwithout undressing. \n\nThat night another wounded man was \ndriven down the Povarskdya, and Mdvra Kuz- \nmfnichna, who was standing at the gate, had \nhim brought into the Rost6vs' yard. Mdvra \nKuzminichna concluded that he w;is a very im- \nportant man. He was being conveyed in a ca- \nIdchevfitli a raised hood, and was quite covered \nby an apron. On the box beside the driver sat \na venerable old attendant. A doctor and two \nsoldiers followed the carriage in a cart. \n\n"Please come in here. The masters are going \naway and the whole house will be empty," said \nthe old woman to the old attendant. \n\n"Well, perhaps," said he with a sigh. "We \ndon't expect to get him home alive! We have \na house of our own in Moscow, but it's a long \nway from here, and there's nobody living in \nit." \n\n"Do us the honor to come in, there's plenty \nof everything in the master's house. Come in," \nsaid Mdvra Kuzmfnichna. "Is he very ill?" she \nasked. \n\nThe attendant made a hopeless gesture. \n\n"We don't expect to get him home! We must \nask the doctor." \n\nAnd the old servant got down from the box \nand went up to the cart. \n\n"All right!" said the doctor. \n\nThe old servant returned to the cal&amp;che, \nlooked into it, shook his head disconsolately, \ntold the driver to turn into the yard, and \nstopped beside Mdvra Kuzminichna. \n\n"O, Lord Jesus Christ!" she murmured. \n\nShe invited them to take the wounded man \ninto the house. \n\n"The masters won't object . . ." she said. \n\nBut they had to avoid carrying the man up- \nstairs, and so they took him into the wing and \nput him in the room that had been Madame \nSchoss'. \n\nThis wounded man was Prince Andrew Bol- \nk6nski. \n\n\n\n49&lt;&gt; \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV \n\nMoscow's LAST DAY had come. It was a clear \nbright autumn day, a Sunday. The church bells \neverywhere were ringing for service, just as \nusual on Sundays. Nobody seemed yet to re- \nalize what awaited the city. \n\nOnly two things indicated the social condi- \ntion of Moscow the rabble, that is the poor \npeople, and the price of commodities. An \nenormous crowd of factory hands, house serfs, \nand peasants, with whom some officials, semi- \nnarists, and gentry were mingled, had gone \nearly that morning to the Three Hills. Having \nwaited there for Rostopchfn who did not turn \nup, they became convinced that Moscow would \nbe surrendered, and then dispersed all about \nthe town to the public houses and cookshops. \nPrices too that day indicated the state of af- \nfairs. The price of weapons, of gold, of carts \nand horses, kept rising, but the value of paper \nmoney and city articles kept falling, so that \nby midday there were instances of carters re- \nmoving valuable goods, such as cloth, and re- \nceiving in payment a half of what they carted, \nwhile peasant horses were fetching five hun- \ndred rubles each, and furniture, mirrors, and \nbronzes were being given away for nothing. \n\nIn the Rostovs' staid old-fashioned house the \ndissolution of former conditions of life was but \nlittle noticeable. As to the serfs the only indi- \ncation was that three out of their huge retinue \ndisappeared during the night, but nothing was \nstolen; and as to the value of their possessions, \nthe thirty peasant carts that had come in from \ntheir estates and which many people envied \nproved to be extremely valuable and they were \noffered enormous sums of money for them. \nNot only were huge sums offered for the horses \nand carts, but on the previous evening and \nearly in the morning of the first of September, \norderlies and servants sent by wounded officers \ncame to the Rost6vs' yard, and wounded men \ndragged themselves there from the Rost6vs' \nand from neighboring houses where they were \naccommodated, entreating the servants to try \nto get them a lift out of Moscow. The major- \ndomo to whom these en treaties were addressed, \nthough he was sorry for the wounded, resolute- \nly refused, saying that he dare not even men- \ntion the matter to the count. Pity these wound- \ned men as one might, it was evident that if \nthey were given one cart there would be no \nreason to refuse another, or all the carts and \none's own carriages as well. Thirty carts could \nnot save all the wounded and in the general \ncatastrophe one could not disregard oneself and \n\n\n\none's own family. So thought the major-domo \non his master's behalf. \n\nOn waking up that morning Count Ilyd Ros- \nt6v left his bedroom softly, so as not to wake \nthe countess who had fallen asleep only toward \nmorning, and came out to the porch in his \nlilac silk dressing gown. In the yard stood the \ncarts ready corded. The carriages were at the \nfront porch. The major-domo stood at the porch \ntalking to an elderly orderly and to a pale \nyoung officer with a bandaged arm. On seeing \nthe count the major-domo made a significant \nand stern gesture to them both to go away. \n\n"Well, Vasflich, is everything ready?" asked \nthe count, and stroking his bald head he looked \ngood-naturedly at the officer and the orderly \nand nodded to them. (He liked to see new \nfaces.) \n\n"We can harness at once, your excellency." \n\n"Well, that's right. As soon as the countess \nwakes we'll be off, God willing! What is it, \ngentlemen?" he added, turning to the officer. \n"Are you staying in my house?" \n\nThe officer came nearer and suddenly his face \nflushed crimson. \n\n"Count, be so good as to allow me . . . for \nGod's sake, to get into some corner of one of \nyour carts I I have nothing here with me. ... I \nshall be all right on a loaded cart " \n\nBefore the officer had finished speaking the \norderly made the same request on behalf of \nhis master. \n\n"Oh, yes, yes, yes!" said the count hastily. "I \nshall be very pleased, very pleased. Vasilich, \nyou'll see to it. Just unload one or two carts. \nWell, what of it ... do what's necessary . . ." \nsaid the count, muttering some indefinite or- \nder. \n\nBut at the same moment an expression of \nwarm gratitude on the officer's face had al- \nready sealed the order. The count looked \naround him. In the yard, at the gates, at the \nwindow of the wings, wounded officers and \ntheir orderlies were to be seen. They were all \nlooking at the count and moving toward the \nporch. \n\n"Please step into the gallery, your excel- \nlency," said the major-domo. "What are your \norders about the pictures?" \n\nThe count went into the house with him, \nrepeating his order not to refuse the wounded \nwho asked for a lift. \n\n"Well, never mind, some of the things can \nbe unloaded," he added in a soft, confidential \nvoice, as though afraid of being overheard. \n\nAt nine o'clock the countess woke up, and \n\n\n\nBOOK \n\nMatrena Timoteevna, who had been her lady's \nmaid before her marriage and now performed \na sort of chief gendarme's duty for her, came \nto say that Madame Schoss was much offended \nand the young ladies' summer dresses could \nnot be left behind. On inquiry, the countess \nlearned that Madame Schoss was offended be- \ncause her trunk had been taken down from \nits cart, and all the loads were being uncorded \nand the luggage taken out of the carts to make \nroom for wounded men whom the count in the \nsimplicity of his heart had ordered that they \nshould take with them. The countess sent for \nher husband. \n\n"What is this, my dear? I hear that the lug- \ngage is being unloaded/' \n\n"You know, love, I wanted to tell you . . . \nCountess dear ... an officer came to me to ask \nfor a few carts for the wounded. After all, ours \nare things that can be bought but think what \nbeing left behind means to them! . . . Really \nnow, in our own yardwe asked them in our- \nselves and there are officers among them. . . . \nYou know, I think, my dear ... let them be \ntaken . . . where's the hurry?" \n\nThe count spoke timidly, as he always did \nwhen talking of money matters. The countess \nwas accustomed to this tone as a precursor of \nnews of something detrimental to the chil- \ndren's interests, such as the building of a new \ngallery or conservatory, the inauguration of a \nprivate theater or an orchestra. She was accus- \ntomed always to oppose anything announced \nin that timid tone and considered it her duty \nto do so. \n\nShe assumed her dolefully submissive man- \nner and said to her husband: ''Listen to me, \nCount, you have managed matters so that we \nare getting nothing for the house, and now you \nwish to throw away all our all the children's \nproperty 1 You said yourself that we have a \nhundred thousand rubles' worth of things in \nthe house. I don't consent, my dear, I don't! Do \nas you please! It's the government's business to \nlook after the wounded; they know that. Look \nat the Lopukhfns opposite, they cleared out \neverything two days ago. That's what other peo- \nple do. It's only we who are such fools. If you \nhave no pity on me, have some for the chil- \ndren." \n\nFlourishing his arms in despair the count \nleft the room without replying. \n\n"Papa, what are you doing that for?" asked \nNatasha, who had followed him into her \nmother's room. \n\n"Nothing! What business is it of yours?" \n\n\n\nELEVEN 491 \n\nmuttered the count angrily. \n\n"But I heard," said Natdsha. "Why does \nMamma object?" \n\n"What business is it of yours?" cried the \ncount. \n\nNatdsha stepped up to the window and pon- \ndered. \n\n"Papa! Here's Berg coming to see us," said \nshe, looking out of the window. \n\nCHAPTER XVI \n\nBERG, the Rost6vs' son-in-law, was already a \ncolonel wearing the orders of Vladimir and \nAnna, and he still filled the quiet and agree- \nable post of assistant to the head of the staff of \nthe assistant commander of the first division \nof the Second Army. \n\nOn the first of September he had come to \nMoscow from the army. \n\nHe had nothing to do in Moscow, but he had \nnoticed that everyone in the army was asking \nfor leave to visit Moscow and had something \nto do there. So he considered it necessary to \nask for leave of absence for family and domes- \ntic reasons. \n\nBerg drove up to his father-in-law's house \nin his spruce little trap with a pair of sleek \nroans, exactly like those of a certain prince. He \nlooked attentively at the carts in the yard and \nwhile going up to the porch took out a clean \npocket handkerchief and tied a knot in it. \n\nFrom the anteroom Berg ran with smooth \nthough impatient steps into the drawing room, \nwhere he embraced the count, kissed the hands \nof Natdsha and S6nya, and hastened to inquire \nafter "Mamma's" health. \n\n"Health, at a time like this?" said the count. \n"Come, tell us the news! Is the army retreating \nor will there be another battle?" \n\n"God Almighty alone can decide the fate of \nour fatherland, Papa," said Berg. "The army \nis burning with a spirit of heroism and the \nleaders, so to say, have now assembled in coun- \ncil. No one knows what is coming. But in gen- \neral I can tell you, Papa, that such a heroic \nspirit, the truly antique valor of the Russian \narmy, which they which it" (he corrected \nhimself) "has shown or displayed in the battle \nof the twenty-sixththere are no words worthy \nto do it justice! I tell you, Papa" (he smote \nhimself on the breast as a general he had heard \nspeaking had done, but Berg did it a trifle late \nfor he should have struck his breast at the words \n"Russian army"), "I tell you frankly that we, \nthe commanders, far from having to urge the \nmen on or anything of that kind, could hardly \n\n\n\n49* \n\n\n\nrestrain those . . . those . . . yes, those exploits \nof antique valor," he went on rapidly. "Gen- \neral Barclay de Tollyrisked his life everywhere \nat the head of the troops, I can assure you. Our \ncorps was stationed on a hillside. You can im- \nagine!" \n\nAnd Berg related all that he remembered of \nthe various talcs he had heard those days. Na- \ntdsha watched him with an intent gaze that \nconfused him, as if she were trying to find in \nhis face the answer to some question. \n\n"Altogether such heroism as was displayed \nby the Russian warriors cannot be imagined or \nadequately praised! "said Berg, glancing round \nat Natasha, and as if anxious to conciliate her, \nreplying to her intent look with a smile. " 'Rus- \nsia is not in Moscow, she lives in the hearts of \nher sons!' Isn't it so, Papa?" said he. \n\nJust then the countess came in from the sit- \nting room with a weary and dissatisfied expres- \nsion. Berg hurriedly jumped up, kissed her \nhand, asked about her health, and, swaying his \nhead from side to side to express sympathy, re- \nmained standing beside her. \n\n"Yes, Mamma, I tell you sincerely that these \nare hard and sad times for every Russian. But \nwhy are you so anxious? You have still time to \nget away. . . ." \n\n"I can't think what the servants are about," \nsaid the countess, turning to her husband. "I \nhave just been told that nothing is ready yet. \nSomebody after all must see to things. One \nmisses Mitenka at such times. There won't be \nany end to it." \n\nThe count was about to say something, but \nevidently restrained himself. He got up from \nhis chair and went to the door. \n\nAt that moment Berg drew out his handker- \nchief as if to blow his nose and, seeing the knot \nin it, pondered, shaking his head sadly and sig- \nnificantly. \n\n"And I have a great favor to ask of you, Pa- \npa," said he. \n\n"Hm . . ." said the count, and stopped. \n\n"I was driving past Yusupov's house just \nnow," said Berg with a laugh, "when the stew- \nard, a man I know, ran out and asked me \nwhether I wouldn't buy something. I went in \nout of curiosity, you know, and there is a small \nchiffonier and a dressing table. You know how \ndear Ve"ra wanted a chiffonier like that and \nhow we had a dispute about it." (At the men- \ntion of the chiffonier and dressing table Berg \ninvoluntarily changed his tone to one of pleas- \nure at his admirable domestic arrangements.) \n"And it's such a beautyl It pulls out and has \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\na secret English drawer, you know! And dear \nVera has long wanted one. I wish to give her a \nsurprise, you see. I saw so many of those peas- \nant carts in your yard. Please let me have one, \nI will pay the man well, and . , ." \n\nThe count frowned and coughed. \n\n"Ask the countess, I don't give orders." \n\n"If it's inconvenient, please don't," said \nBerg. "Only I so wanted it, for dear Wra's \nsake." \n\n"Oh, go to the devil, all of you! To the devil, \nthe devil, the devil . . . !" cried the old count. \n"My head's in a whirl!" \n\nAnd he left the room. The countess began to \ncry. \n\n"Yes, Mammal Yes, these are very hard \ntimes!" said Berg. \n\nNatdsha left the room with her father and, \nas if finding it difficult to reach some decision, \nfirst followed him and then ran downstairs. \n\nPetya was in the porch, engaged in giving \nout weapons to the servants who were to leave \nMoscow. The loaded carts were still standing \nin the yard. Two of them had been uncorded \nand a wounded officer was climbing into one \nof them helped by an orderly. \n\n"Do you know what it's about?" Pdtya asked \nNatasha. \n\nShe understood that he meant what were \ntheir parents quarreling about. She did not \nanswer. \n\n"It's because Papa wanted to give up all the \ncarts to the wounded," said Pdtya. "Vasilich \ntold me. I consider . . ." \n\n"I consider," Natdsha suddenly almost shout- \ned, turning her angry face to Petya,"! consider \nit so horrid, so abominable, so ... I don't know \nwhat. Are we despicable Germans?" \n\nHer throat quivered with convulsive sobs \nand, afraid of weakening and letting the force \nof her anger run to waste, she turned and \nrushed headlong up the stairs. \n\nBerg was sitting beside the countess consol- \ning her with the respectful attention of a rela- \ntive. The count, pipe in hand, was pacing up \nand down the room, when Natasha, her face \ndistorted by anger, burst in like a tempest and \napproached her mother with rapid steps. \n\n"It's horrid! It's abominable!" she screamed. \n"You can't possibly have ordered it!" \n\nBerg and the countess looked at her, per- \nplexed and frightened. The count stood still \nat the window and listened. \n\n"Mamma, it's impossible: see what is going \non in the yard I" she cried. "They will be \nleft! . . ." \n\n\n\nBOOK ELEVEN \nyou? Who are \n\n\n\n493 \n\n\n\n"What's the matter with \n'they'? What do you want?" \n\n"Why, the wounded! It's impossible, Mam- \nma. It's monstrous! . . . No, Mamma darling, \nit's not the thing. Please forgive me, darling. \n. . . Mamma, what does it matter what we take \naway? Only look what is going on in the yard \n. . . Mamma! . . . It's impossible!" \n\nThe count stood by the window and listened \nwithout turning round. Suddenly he sniffed \nand put his face closer to the window. \n\nThe countess glanced at her daughter, saw \nher face full of shame for her mother, saw her \nagitation, and understood why her husband \ndid not turn to look at her now, and she glanced \nround quite disconcerted. \n\n"Oh, do as you like! Am I hindering any- \none?" she said, not surrendering at once. \n\n"Mamma, darling, forgive me!" \n\nBut the countess pushed her daughter away \nand went up to her husband. \n\n"My dear, you order what is right. . . . You \nknow I don't understand about it," said she, \ndropping her eyes shamefacedly. \n\n"The eggs . . . the eggs are teaching the hen \n. . ." muttered the count through tears of joy, \nand he embraced his wife who was glad to hide \nher look of shame on his breast. \n\n"Papa! Mamma! May I see to it? May I? \n. . ." asked Natdsha. "We will still take all the \nmost necessary things." \n\nThe count nodded affirmatively, and Na- \ntdsha, at the rapid pace at which she used to \nrun when playing at tag, ran through the ball- \nroom to the anteroom and downstairs into the \nyard. \n\nThe servants gathered round Natdsha, but \ncould not believe the strange order she brought \nthem until the count himself, in his wile's \nname, confirmed the order to give up all the \ncarts to the wounded and take the trunks to the \nstorerooms. When they understood that order \nthe servants set to work at this new task with \npleasure and zeal. It no longer seemed strange \nto them but on the contrary it seemed the only \nthing that could be done, just as a quarter of \nan hour before it had not seemed strange to \nanyone that the wounded should be left be- \nhind and the goods carted away but that had \nseemed the only thing to do. \n\nThe whole household, as if to atone for not \nhaving done it sooner, set eagerly to work at \nthe new task of placing the wounded in the \ncarts. The wounded dragged themselves out of \ntheir rooms and stood with pale but happy \nfaces round the carts. The news that carts were \n\n\n\nto be had spread to the neighboring houses, \nfrom which wounded men began to come into \nthe Rost6vs' yard. Many of the wounded \nasked them not to unload the carts but only to \nlet them sit on the top of the things. But the \nwork of unloading, once started, could not be \narrested. It seemed not to matter whether all \nor only half the things were left behind. Cases \nfull of china, bronzes, pictures, and mirrors \nthat had been so carefully packed the night \nbefore now lay about the yard, and still they \nwent on searching for and finding possibili- \nties of unloading this or that and letting the \nwounded have another and yet another cart. \n\n"We can take four more men," said the \nsteward. "They can have my trap, or else what \nis to become of them?" \n\n"Let them have my wardrobe cart," said the \ncountess. "Dunyasha can go with me in the \ncarriage." \n\nThey unloaded the wardrobe cart and sent \nit to take wounded men from a house two \ndoors off. The whole household, servants in- \ncluded, was bright and animated. Natdsha was \nin a state of rapturous excitement such as she \nhad not known for a long time. \n\n"What could we fasten this onto?" asked the \nservants, trying to fix a trunk on the narrow \nfootboard behind a carriage. "We must keep \nat least one cart." \n\n"What's in it?" asked Natasha. \n\n"The count's books." \n\n"Leave it, Vasilich will put it away. It's not \nwanted." \n\nThe phaeton was full of people and there \nwas a doubt as to where Count Peter could sit. \n\n"On the box. You'll sit on the box, won't you, \nPtya?" cried Natdsha. \n\nS6nya too was busy all this time, but the aim \nof her efforts was quite different from Natd- \nsha's. She was putting away the things that had \nto be left behind and making a list of them as \nthe countess wished, and she tried to get as \nmuch taken away with them as possible. \n\nCHAPTER XVII \n\nBEFORE TWO O'CLOCK in the afternoon the Ros- \nt6vs' four carriages, packed full and with the \nhorses harnessed, stood at the front door. One \nby one the carts with the wounded had moved \nout of the yard. \n\nThe caliche in which Prince Andrew was be- \ning taken attracted S6nya's attention as it passed \nthe front porch. With the help of a maid she \nwas arranging a seat for the countess in the \nhuge high coach that stood at the entrance. \n\n\n\n494 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\n"Whose caleche is that?" she inquired, lean- \ning out of the carriage window. \n\n"Why, didn't you know, Miss?" replied the \nmaid. "The wounded prince: he spent the \nnight in our house and is going with us." \n\n"But who is it? What's his name?" \n\n"It's our intended that was Prince Bolk6n- \nski himself! They say he is dying," replied the \nmaid with a sigh. \n\nS6nya jumped out of the coach and ran to \nthe countess. The countess, tired out and al- \nready dressed in shawl and bonnet for her \njourney, was pacing up and down the drawing \nroom, waiting for the household to assemble \nfor the usual silent prayer with closed doors \nbefore starting. Natdsha was not in the room. \n\n"Mamma," said S6nya, "Prince Andrew is \nhere, mortally wounded. He is going with us." \n\nThe countess opened her eyes in dismay and, \nseizing S6nya's arm, glanced around. \n\n"Natasha?" she murmured. \n\nAt that moment this news had only one sig- \nnificance for both of them. They knew their \nNatdsha, and alarm as to what would happen \nif she heard this news stifled all sympathy for \nthe man they both liked. \n\n"Natdsha does not know yet, but he is go- \ning with us," said S6nya. \n\n"You say he is dying?" \n\nS6nya nodded. \n\nThe countess put her arms around S6nya \nand began to cry. \n\n"The ways of God are past finding out!" she \nthought, feeling that the Almighty Hand, \nhitherto unseen, was becoming manifest in all \nthat was now taking place. \n\n"Well, Mamma? Everything is ready. What's \nthe matter?" asked Natdsha, as with animated \nface she ran into the room. \n\n"Nothing," answered the countess. "If ev- \nerything is ready let us start." \n\nAnd the countess bent over her reticule to \nhide her agitated face. S6nya embraced Na- \ntsha and kissed her. \n\nNatdsha looked at her inquiringly. \n\n"What is it? What has happened?" \n\n"Nothing . . . No . . ." \n\n"Is it something very bad for me? What is \nit?" persisted Natdsha with her quick intuition. \n\nSonya sighed and made no reply. The \ncount, Pdtya, Madame Schoss, Mdvra Kuzmf- \nnichna, and Vasflich came into the drawing \nroom and, having closed the doors, they all \nsat down and remained for some moments \nsilently seated without looking at one an- \nother. \n\n\n\nThe count was the first to rise, and with a \nloud sigh crossed himself before the icon. All \nthe others did the same. Then the count em- \nbraced Mdvra Kuzmfnichna and Vasflich, who \nwere to remain in Moscow, and while they \ncaught at his hand and kissed his shoulder he \npatted their backs lightly with some vaguely \naffectionate and comforting words. The count- \ness went into the oratory and there S6nya found \nher on her knees before the icons that had been \nleft here and there hanging on the wall. (The \nmost precious ones, with which some family \ntradition was connected, were being taken with \nthem.) \n\nIn the porch and in the yard the men whom \nPtya had armed with swords and daggers, with \ntrousers tucked inside their high boots and \nwith belts and girdles tightened, were taking \nleave of those remaining behind. \n\nAs is always the case at a departure, much \nhad been forgotten or put in the wrong place, \nand for a long time two menservants stood one \non each side of the open door and the carnage \nsteps waiting to help the countess in, while \nmaids rushed with cushions and bundles from \nthe house to the carriages, the caleche, the pha- \neton, and back again. \n\n"They always will forget every thingl" said \nthe countess. "Don't you know I can't sit like \nthat?" \n\nAnd Dunyasha, with clenched teeth, with- \nout replying but with an aggrieved look on her \nface, hastily got into the coach to rearrange the \nseat. \n\n"Oh, those servants!" said the count, sway- \ning his head. \n\nEfim, the old coachman, who was the only \none the countess trusted to drive her, sat \nperched up high on the box and did not so \nmuch as glance round at what was going on be- \nhind him. From thirty years' experience he \nknew it would be some time yet before the or- \nder, "Be off, in God's name!" would be given \nhim: and he knew that even when it was said \nhe would be stopped once or twice more while \nthey sent back to fetch something that had \nbeen forgotten, and even after that he would \nagain be stopped and the countess herself \nwould lean out of the window and beg him \nfor the love of heaven to drive carefully down \nthe hill. He knew all this and therefore waited \ncalmly for what would happen, with more pa- \ntience than the horses, especially the near one, \nthe chestnut Falcon, who was pawing the \nground and champing his bit. At last all were \nseated, the carriage steps were folded and \n\n\n\nBOOK ELEVEN \n\n\n\n495 \n\n\n\npulled up, the door was shut, somebody was \nsent for a traveling case, and the countess \nleaned out and said what she had to say. Then \nEfim deliberately doffed his hat and began \ncrossing himself. The postilion and all the oth- \ner servants did the same. "Off, in God's name!" \nsaid Efim, putting on his hat. "Start!" The \npostilion started the horses, the off pole horse \ntugged at his collar, the high springs creaked, \nand the body of the coach swayed. The foot- \nman sprang onto the box of the moving coach \nwhich jolted as it passed out of the yard onto \nthe uneven roadway; the other vehicles jolted \nin their turn, and the procession of carriages \nmoved up the street. In the carriages, the cale- \nche f and the phaeton, all crossed themselves as \nthey passed the church opposite the house. \nThose who were to remain in Moscow walked \non either side of the vehicles seeing the trav- \nelers off. \n\nRarely had Natasha experienced so joyful a \nfeeling as now, sitting in the carriage beside \nthe countess and gazing at the slowly receding \nwalls of forsaken, agitated Moscow. Occasion- \nally she leaned out of the carriage window and \nlooked back and then forward at the long train \nof wounded in front of them. Almost at the \nhead of the line she could see the raised hood \nof Prince Andrew's caliche. She did not know \nwho was in it, but each time she looked at the \nprocession her eyes sought that caleche. She \nknew it was right in front. \n\nIn Kiidrino, from the Nikftski, Prdsnya, and \nPodnovinsk Streets came several other trains \nof vehicles similar to the Rost6vs', and as they \npassed along the Sad6vaya Street the carriages \nand carts formed two rows abreast. \n\nAs they were going round the Siikharev wa- \nter tower Natasha, who was inquisitively and \nalertly scrutinizing the people driving or walk- \ning past, suddenly cried out in joyful surprise: \n\n"Dear me! Mamma, S6nya, look, it's he!" \n\n"Who? Who?" \n\n"Look! Yes, on my word, it's Bezukhov!" \nsaid Natdsha, putting her head out of the car- \nriage and staring at a tall, stout man in a coach- \nman's long coat, who from his manner of walk- \ning and moving was evidently a gentleman in \ndisguise, and who was passing under the arch \nof the Siikharev tower accompanied by a small, \nsallow-faced, beardless old man in a frieze coat. \n\n"Yes, it really is Bezukhov in a coachman's \ncoat, with a queer-looking old boy. Really," \nsaid Natdsha, "look, lookl" \n\n"No, it's not he. How can you talk such non- \nsense?" \n\n\n\n"Mamma," screamed Natdsha, "I'll stake my \nhead it's he! I assure you! Stop, stop!" she cried \nto the coachman. \n\nBut the coachman could not stop, for from \nthe Meshchdnski Street came more carts and \ncarriages, and the Rost6vs were being shouted \nat to move on and not block the way. \n\nIn fact, however, though now much farther \noff than before, the Rost6vs all saw Pierre or \nsomeone extraordinarily like him in a coach- \nman's coat, going down the street with head \nbent and a serious face beside a small, beard- \nless old man who looked like a footman. That \nold man noticed a face thrust out of the car- \nriage window gazing at them, and respectfully \ntouching Pierre's elbow said something to him \nand pointed to the carriage. Pierre, evidently \nengrossed in thought, could not at first under- \nstand him. At length when he had understood \nand looked in the direction the old man indi- \ncated, he recognized Natdsha, and following \nhis first impulse stepped instantly and rapidly \ntoward the coach. But having taken a dozen \nsteps he seemed to remember something and \nstopped. \n\nNatdsha's face, leaning out of the window, \nbeamed with quizzical kindliness. \n\n"Peter Kirilovich, come here! We have rec- \nognized you! This is wonderful!" she cried, \nholding out her hand to him. "What are you \ndoing? Why are you like this?" \n\nPierre took her outstretched hand and kissed \nit awkwardly as he walked along beside her \nwhile the coach still moved on. \n\n"What is the matter, Count?" asked the \ncountess in a surprised and commiserating \ntone. \n\n"What? What? Why? Don't ask me," said \nPierre, and looked round at Natdsha whose \nradiant, happy expression of which he was \nconscious without looking at her filled him \nwith enchantment. \n\n"Are you remaining in Moscow, then?" \n\nPierre hesitated. \n\n"In Moscow?" he said in a questioning tone. \n"Yes, in Moscow. Goodby!" \n\n"Ah, if only I were a man! I'd certainly stay \nwith you. How splendid!"said Natdsha. "Mam- \nma, if you'll let me, I'll stay!" \n\nPierre glanced absently at Natdsha and was \nabout to say something, but the countess inter- \nrupted him. \n\n"You were at the battle, we heard." \n\n"Yes, I was," Pierre answered. "There will \nbe another battle tomorrow . . ." he began, but \nNatdsha interrupted him. \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\n"But what is the matter with you, Count? \nYou are not like yourself. . . ." \n\n"Oh, don't ask me, don't ask me! I don't \nknow myself. Tomorrow . . . But no! Good-by, \ngood-byl" he muttered. "It's an awful time!" \nand dropping behind the carriage he stepped \nonto the pavement. \n\nNatdsha continued to lean out of the win- \ndow for a long time, beaming at him with her \nkindly, slightly quizzical, happy smile. \n\nCHAPTER XVIII \n\nFOR THE LASTTWO DAYS, ever since leavinghome, \nPierre had been living in the empty house of \nhis deceased benefactor, Bazddev. This is how \nit happened. \n\nWhen he woke up on the morning after his \nreturn to Moscow and his interview with \nCount Rostopchfn, he could not for some time \nmake out where he was and what was expected \nof him. When he was informed that among \nothers awaiting him in his reception room \nthere was a Frenchman who had brought a let- \nter from his wife, the Countess Hellene, he felt \nsuddenly overcome by that sense of confusion \nand hopelessness to which he was apt to suc- \ncumb. He felt that everything was now at an \nend, all was in confusion and crumbling to \npieces, that nobody was right or wrong, the \nfuture held nothing, and there was no escape \nfrom this position. Smiling unnaturally and \nmuttering to himself, he first sat down on the \nsofa in an attitude of despair, then rose, went \nto the door of the reception room and peeped \nthrough the crack, returned flourishing his \narms, and took up a book. His major-domo \ncame in a second time to say that the French- \nman who had brought the letter from the \ncountess was very anxious to see him if only \nfor a minute, and that someone from Bazdev's \nwidow had called to ask Pierre to take charge \nof her husband's books, as she herself was leav- \ning for the country. \n\n"Oh, yes, in a minute; wait ... or no! No, of \ncourse ... go and say I will come directly/' \nPierre replied to the major-domo. \n\nBut as soon as the man had left the room \nPierre took up his hat which was lying on the \ntable and went out of his study by the other \ndoor. There was no one in the passage. He \nwent along the whole length of this passage to \nthe stairs and, frowning and rubbing his fore- \nhead with both hands, went down as far as the \nfirst landing. The hall porter was standing at \nthe front door. From the landing where Pierre \nstood there was a second staircase leading to \n\n\n\nthe back entrance. He went down that stair- \ncase and out into the yard. No one had seen \nhim. But there were some carriages waiting, \nand as soon as Pierre stepped out of the gate \nthe coachmen and the yard porter noticed him \nand raised their caps to him. When he felt he \nwas being looked at he behaved like an ostrich \nwhich hides its head in a bush in order not to \nbe seen: he hung his head and quickening his \npace went down the street. \n\nOf all the affairs awaiting Pierre that day \nthe sorting of Joseph Bazd^ev's books and \npapers appeared to him the most necessary. \n\nHe hired the first cab he met and told the \ndriver to go to the Patriarch's Ponds, where \nthe widow Bazdev's house was. \n\nContinually turning round to look at the \nrows of loaded carts that were making their \nway from all sides out of Moscow, and balanc- \ning his bulky body so as not to slip out ^f the \nramshackle old vehicle, Pierre, experiencing \nthe joyful feeling of a boy escaping from school, \nbegan to talk to his driver. \n\nThe man told him that arms were being dis- \ntributed today at the Krdmlin and that tomor- \nrow everyone would be sent out beyond the \nThree Hills gates and a great battle would be \nfought there. \n\nHaving reached the Patriarch's Ponds Pierre \nfound the Bazddevs' house, where he had not \nbeen for a long time past. He went up to the \ngate. Gerasim, that sallow beardless old man \nPierre had seen at Torzh6k five years before \nwith Joseph Ba/dcev, came out in answer to \nhis knock. \n\n"At home?" asked Pierre. \n\n"Owing to the present state of things Sophia \nDanilovna has gone to theTorzhok estate with \nthe children, your excellency." \n\n"I will come in all the same, I have to look \nthrough the books," said Pierre. \n\n"Be so good as to step in. Makar Alex^evich, \nthe brother of my late master may the king- \ndom of heaven be his has remained here, but \nhe is in a weak state as you know," said the old \nservant. \n\nPierre knew that Makar Alex^evich was \nJoseph Bazddev's half-insane brother and a \nhard drinker. \n\n"Yes, yes, I know. Let us go in . . ." said \nPierre and entered the house. \n\nA tall, bald-headed old man with a red nose, \nwearing a dressing gown and with galoshes on \nhis bare feet, stood in the anteroom. On seeing \nPierre he muttered something angrily and \nwent away along the passage. \n\n\n\nBOOK ELEVEN \n\n"He was a very clever man but has now \ngrown quite feeble, as your honor sees," said \nGerasim. "Will you step into the study?" Pierre \nnodded. "As it was sealed up so it has remained, \nbut Sophia Danilovna gave orders that if any- \none should come from you they were to have \nthe books." \n\nPierre went into that gloomy study which he \nhad entered with such trepidation in his bene- \nfactor's lifetime. The room, dusty and un- \ntouched since the death of Joseph Bazd^ev, was \nnow even gloomier. \n\nGerdsim opened one of the shutters and left \nthe room on tiptoe. Pierre went round the \nstudy, approached the cupboard in which the \nmanuscripts were kept, and took out what had \nonce been one of the most important, the holy \nof holies of the order. This was the authentic \nScotch Acts with Bazdev's notes and explana- \ntion.. He sat down at the dusty writing table, \nand, having laid the manuscripts before him, \nopened them out, closed them, finally pushed \nthem away, and resting his head on his hand \nsank into meditation. \n\nGerdsim looked cautiously into the study \nseveral times and saw Pierre always sitting in \nthe same attitude. \n\nMore than two hours passed and Gerasim \ntook the liberty of making a slight noise at the \ndoor to attract his attention, but Pierre did \nnot hear him. \n\n"Is the cabman to be discharged, your hon- \nor?" \n\n"Oh yes!" said Pierre, rousing himself and \nrising hurriedly. "Look here," he added, tak- \ning Gerasim by a button of his coat and look- \ning down at the old man with moist, shining, \nand ecstatic eyes, "I say, do you know that \nthere is going to be a battle tomorrow?" \n\n"We heard so," replied the man. \n\n"I beg you not to tell anyone who I am, and \nto do what I ask you." \n\n"Yes, your excellency," replied Gerasim. \n"Will you have something to eat?" \n\n"No, but I want something else. I want peas- \nant clothes and a pistol," said Pierre, unex- \npectedly blushing. \n\n"Yes, your excellency," said Gcrdsim after \nthinking for a moment. \n\nAll the rest of that day Pierre spent alone in \nhis benefactor's study, and Gerasim heard him \npacing restlessly from one corner to another \nand talking to himself. And he spent the night \non a bed made up for him there. \n\nGerasim, being a servant who in his time \nhad seen many strange things, accepted Pierre's \n\n\n\n497 \n\ntaking up his residence in the house without \nsurprise, and seemed pleased to have someone \nto wait on. That same eveningwithout even \nasking himself what they were wanted for he \nprocured a coachman's coat and cap for Pierre, \nand promised to get him the pistol next day. \nMakar Alex^evich came twice that evening \nshuffling along in his galoshes as far as the \ndoor and stopped and looked ingratiatingly at \nPierre. But as soon as Pierre turned toward \nhim he wrapped his dressing gown around him \nwith a shamefaced and angry look and hurried \naway. It was when Pierre (wearing the coach- \nman's coat which Gerdsim had procured for \nhim and had disinfected by steam) was on his \nway with the old man to buy the pistol at the \nSiikharev market that he met the Rost6vs. \n\nCHAPTER XIX \n\nKUTUZOV'S ORDER to retreat through Moscow \nto the Ryazan road was issued at night on the \nfirst of September. \n\nThe first troops started at once, and during \nthe night they marched slowly and steadily \nwithout hurry. At daybreak, however, those \nnearing the town at the Dorogomilov bridge \nsaw ahead of them masses of soldiers crowding \nand hurrying across the bridge, ascending on \nthe opposite side and blocking the streets and \nalleys, while endless masses of troops were bear- \ning down on them from behind, and an un- \nreasoning hurry and alarm overcame them. \nThey all rushed forward to the bridge, onto \nit, and to the fords and the boats. Kutiizov \nhimself had driven round by side streets to the \nother side of Moscow. \n\nBy ten o'clock in the morning of the second \nof September, only the rearguard remained in \nthe Dorogomilov suburb, where they had am- \nple room. The main army was on the other \nside of Moscow or beyond it. \n\nAt that very time, at ten in the morning of \nthe second of September, Napoleon was stand- \ning among his troops on the Pokl6nny Hill \nlooking at the panorama spread out before \nhim. From the twenty-sixth of August to the \nsecond of September, that is from the battle of \nBorodinti to the entry of the French into Mos- \ncow, during the whole of that agitating, mem- \norable week, there had been the extraordi- \nnary autumn weather that always comes as a \nsurprise, when the sun hangs low and gives \nmore heat than in spring, when everything \nshines so brightly in the rare clear atmosphere \nthat the eyes smart, when the lungs are strength- \nened and refreshed by inhaling the aromatic \n\n\n\n498 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nautumn air, when even the nights are warm, \nand when in those dark warm nights, golden \nstars startle and delight us continually by fall- \ning from the sky. \n\nAt ten in the morning of the second of Sep- \ntember this weather still held. \n\nThe brightness of the morning was magical. \nMoscow seen from the Pokl6nny Hill lay spa- \nciously spread out with her river, her gardens, \nand her churches, and she seemed to be living \nher usual life, her cupolas glittering like stars \nin the sunlight. \n\nThe view of the strange city with its pecul- \niar architecture, such as he had never seen be- \nfore, filled Napoleon with the rather envious \nand uneasy curiosity men feel when they see \nan alien form of life that has no knowledge of \nthem. This city was evidently living with the \nfull force of its own life. By the indefinite signs \nwhich, even at a distance, distinguish a living \nbody from a dead one, Napoleon from the Po- \nk!6nny Hill perceived the throb of life in the \ntown and felt, as it were, the breathing of that \ngreat and beautiful body. \n\nEvery Russian looking at Moscow feels her \nto be a mother; every foreigner who sees her, \neven if ignorant of her significance as the \nmother city, must feel her feminine character, \nand Napoleon felt it. \n\n"Cette ville asiatique aux innombrables 4g- \nUses, Moscou la saint e. La voil&amp; done en fin , \ncette fameuse ville! II etait temps" * said he, \nand dismounting he ordered a plan of Moscow \nto be spread out before him, and summoned \nLelorgne d'Ideville, the interpreter. \n\n"A town captured by the enemy is like a \nmaid who has lost her honor," thought he (he \nhad said so to Tuchk6v at Smolensk). From \nthat point of view he gazed at the Oriental \nbeauty he had not seen before. It seemed \nstrange to him that his long-felt wish, which \nhad seemed unattainable, had at last been re- \nalized. In the clear morning light he gazed \nnow at the city and now at the plan, consider- \ning its details, and the assurance of possessing \nit agitated and awed him. \n\n"But could it be otherwise?" he thought. \n"Here is this capital at my feet. Where is Alex- \nander now, and of what is he thinking? A \nstrange, beautiful, and majestic city; and a \nstrange and majestic moment! In what light \nmust I appear to them!" thought he, thinking \nof his troops. "Here she is, the reward for all \n\n1 "That Asiatic city of the innumerable churches, \nholy Moscow! Here it is then at last, that famous \ncity. It was high time." \n\n\n\nthose fainthearted rnen, M he reflected, glanc- \ning at those near him and at the troops who \nwere approaching and forming up. "One word \nfrom me, one movement of my hand, and that \nancient capital of the Tsars would perish. But \nmy clemency is always ready to descend upon \nthe vanquished. I must be magnanimous and \ntruly great. But no, it can't be true that I am \nin Moscow," he suddenly thought. "Yet here \nshe is lying at my feet, with her golden domes \nand crosses scintillating and twinkling in the \nsunshine. But I shall spare her. On the ancient \nmonuments of barbarism and despotism I will \ninscribe great words of justice and mercy. . . . \nIt is just this which Alexander will feel most \npainfully, I know him." (It seemed to Napo- \nleon that the chief import of what was taking \nplace lay in the personal struggle between him- \nself and Alexander.) "From the height of the \nKremlin yes, there is the Kremlin, yes I will \ngive them just laws; I will teach them the \nmeaning of true civilization, I will make gen- \nerations of boyars remember their conqueror \nwith love. I will tell the deputation that I did \nnot, and do not, desire war, that I have waged \nwar only against the false policy of their court; \nthat I love and respect Alexander and that in \nMoscow I will accept terms of peace worthy \nof myself and of my people. I do not wish to \nutilize the fortunes of war to humiliate an \nhonored monarch. 'Boyars,' I will say to them, \n'I do not desire war, I desire the peace and \nwelfare of all my subjects.' However, I know \ntheir presence will inspire me, and I shall speak \nto them as I always do: clearly, impressively, \nand majestically. But can it be true that I am \nin Moscow? Yes, there she lies." \n\n"Qu r on m'amene les boyars" a said he to his \nsuite. \n\nA general with a brilliant suite galloped off \nat once to fetch the boyars. \n\nTwo hours passed. Napoleon had lunched \nand was again standing in the same place on \nthe Pokl6nny Hill awaiting the deputation. \nHis speech to the boyars had already taken \ndefinite shape in his imagination. That speech \nwas full of dignity and greatness as Napoleon \nunderstood it. \n\nHe was himself carried away by the tone of \nmagnanimity he intended to adopt toward \nMoscow. In his imagination he appointed days \nfor assemblies at the palace of the Tsars, at \nwhich Russian notables and his own would \nmingle. He mentally appointed a governor, \none who would win the hearts of the people. \n\n1 "Bring the boyars to me." \n\n\n\nBOOK ELEVEN \n\nHaving learned that there were many chari- \ntable institutions in Moscow he mentally de- \ncided that he would shower favors on them all. \nHe thought that, as in Africa he had to put on \na burnoose and sit in a mosque, so in Moscow \nhe must be beneficent like the Tsars. And in \norder finally to touch the hearts of the Rus- \nsiansand being like all Frenchmen unable to \nimagine anything sentimental without a refer- \nence to ma ch&amp;re, ma tendre, ma pauvre m&amp;re * \nhe decided that he would place an inscrip- \ntion on all these establishments in large letters: \n"This establishment is dedicated to my dear \nmother." Or no, it should be simply: Maison \nde ma Mtrefhe concluded. "But am I really \nin Moscow? Yes, here it lies before me, but \nwhy is the deputation from the city so long in \nappearing?" he wondered. \n\nMeanwhile an agitated consultation was be- \ning carried on in whispers among his generals \nand marshals at the rear of his suite. Those \nsent to fetch the deputation had returned with \nthe news that Moscow was empty, that every- \none had left it. The faces of those who were \nnot conferring together were pale and per- \nturbed. They were not alarmed by the fact that \nMoscow had been abandoned by its inhabi- \ntants (grave as that fact seemed), but by the \nquestion how to tell the Emperor without \nputting him in the terrible position of appear- \ning ridiculous that he had been awaiting the \nboyars so long in vain: that there were drunk- \nen mobs left in Moscow but no one else. Some \nsaid that a deputation of some sort must be \nscraped together, others disputed that opinion \nand maintained that the Emperor should first \nbe carefully and skillfully prepared, and then \ntold the truth. \n\n"He will have to be told, all the same," said \nsome gentlemen of the suite. "But, gentlemen \n\n\n\n499 \n\ndrawn out was beginning to lose its sublimity, \ngave a sign with his hand. A single report of a \nsignaling gun followed, and the troops, who \nwere already spread out on different sides of \nMoscow, moved into the city through the Tver, \nKaluga, and Dorogomflov gates. Faster and \nfaster, vying with one another, they moved at \nthe double or at a trot, vanishing amid the \nclouds of dust they raised and making the air \nring with a deafening roar of mingling shouts. \nDrawn on by the movement of his troops \nNapoleon rode with them as far as the Doro- \ngomilov gate, but there again stopped and, dis- \nmounting from his horse, paced for a long \ntime by the Kammer-Kolle'zski rampart, await- \ning the deputation. \n\n\n\nThe position was the more awkward because \nthe Emperor, meditating upon his magnani- \nmous plans, was pacing patiently up and down \nbefore the outspread map, occasionally glanc- \ning along the road to Moscow from under his \nlifted hand with a bright and proud smile. \n\n"But it's impossible . . ." declared the gentle- \nmen of the suite, shrugging their shoulders but \nnot venturing to utter the implied word le \nridicule. . . . \n\nAt last the Emperor, tired of futile expecta- \ntion, his actor's instinct suggesting to him that \nthe sublime moment having been too long \n\n1 "My dear, my tender, my poor mother." \n1 "House of my Mother." \n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX \n\nMEANWHILE Moscow was empty. There were \nstill people in it, perhaps a fiftieth part of its \nformer inhabitants had remained, but it was \nempty. It was empty in the sense that a dying \nqueenless hive is empty. \n\nIn a queenless hive no life is left though to \na superficial glance it seems as much alive as \nother hives. \n\nThe bees circle round a queenless hive in the \nhot beams of the midday sun as gaily as around \nthe living hives; from a distance it smells of \nhoney like the others, and bees fly in and out \nin the same way. But one has only to observe \nthat hive to realize that there is no longer \nany life in it. The bees do not fly in the same \nway, the smell and the sound that meet the \nbeekeeper are not the same. To the beekeep- \ner's tap on the wall of the sick hive, instead \nof the former instant unanimous humming \nof tens of thousands of bees with their ab- \ndomens threateningly compressed, and pro- \nducing by the rapid vibration of their wings \nan aerial living sound, the only reply is a dis- \nconnected buzzing from different parts of the \ndeserted hive. From the alighting board, in- \nstead of the former spirituous fragrant smell of \nhoney and venom, and the warm whiffs of \ncrowded life, comes an odor of emptiness and \ndecay mingling with the smell of honey. There \nare no longer sentinels sounding the alarm \nwith their abdomens raised, and ready to die \nin defense of the hive. There is no longer the \nmeasured quiet sound of throbbing activity, \nlike the sound of boiling water, but diverse \ndiscordant sounds of disorder. In and out of \nthe hive long black robber bees smeared with \nhoney fly timidly and shiftily. They do not \nsting, but crawl away from danger. Formerly \n\n\n\n5 oo \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nonly bees laden with honey flew into the hive, \nand they flew out empty; now they fly out \nladen. The beekeeper opens the lower part of \nthe hive and peers in. Instead of black, glossy \nbeestamed by toil, clinging to one another's \nlegs and drawing out the wax, with a ceaseless \nhum of labor that used to hang in long clus- \nters down to the floor of the hive, drowsy \nshriveled bees crawl about separately in vari- \nous directions on the floor and walls of the \nhive. Instead of a neatly glued floor, swept by \nthe bees with the fanning of their wings, there \nis a floor littered with bits of wax, excrement, \ndying bees scarcely moving their legs, and dead \nones that have not been cleared away. \n\nThe beekeeper opens the upper part of the \nhive and examines the super. Instead of serried \nrows of bees sealing up every gap in the combs \nand keeping the brood warm, he sees the skill- \nful complex structures of the combs, but no \nlonger in their former state of purity. All is \nneglected and foul. Black robber bees are \nswiftly and stealthily prowling about the \ncombs, and the short home bees, shriveled and \nlistless as if they were old, creep slowly about \nwithout trying to hinder the robbers, having \nlost all motive and all sense of life. Drones, \nbumblebees, wasps, and butterflies knock awk- \nwardly against the walls of the hive in their \nflight. Here and there among the cells con- \ntaining dead brood and honey an angry buzz- \ning can sometimes be heard. Here and there a \ncouple of bees, by force of habit and custom \ncleaning out the brood cells, with efforts be- \nyond their strength laboriously drag away a \ndead bee or bumblebee without knowing why \nthey do it. In another corner two old bees are \nlanguidly fighting, or cleaning themselves, or \nfeeding one another, without themselves know- \ning whether they do it with friendly or hostile \nintent. In a third place a crowd of bees, crush- \ning one another, attack some victim and fight \nand smother it, and the victim, enfeebled or \nkilled, drops from above slowly and lightly as \na feather, among the heap of corpses. The \nkeeper opens the two center partitions to ex- \namine the brood cells. In place of the former \nclose dark circles formed by thousands of bees \nsitting back to back and guarding the high \nmystery of generation, he sees hundreds of \ndull, listless, and sleepy shells of bees. They \nhave almost all died unawares, sitting in the \nsanctuary they had guarded and which is now \nno more. They reek of decay and death. Only \na few of them still move, rise, and feebly fly to \nsettle on the enemy's hand, lacking the spirit \n\n\n\nto die stinging him; the rest are dead and fall \nas lightly as fish scales. The beekeeper closes \nthe hive, chalks a mark on it, and when he \nhas time tears out its contents and burns it \nclean. \n\nSo in the same way Moscow was empty when \nNapoleon, weary, uneasy, and morose, paced \nup and down in front of the Kdmmer-Kollez- \nski rampart, awaiting what to his mind was a \nnecessary, if but formal, observance of the \nproprieties a deputation. \n\nIn various corners of Moscow there still re- \nmained a few people aimlessly moving about, \nfollowing their old habits and hardly aware of \nwhat they were doing. \n\nWhen with due circumspection Napoleon \nwas informed that Moscow was empty, he \nlooked angrily at his informant, turned away, \nand silently continued to walk to and fro. \n\n"My carriage!" he said. \n\nHe took his seat beside the aide-de-camp on \nduty and drove into the suburb. "Moscow de- \nserted!" he said to himself. "What an incredi- \nble event!" \n\nHe did not drive into the town, but put up \nat an inn in the Dorogomilov suburb. \n\nThe coup de theatre had not come off. \n\nCHAPTER XXI \n\nTHE RUSSIAN TROOPS were passing through \nMoscow from two o'clock at night till two in \nthe afternoon and bore away with them the \nwounded and the last of the inhabitants who \nwere leaving. \n\nThe greatest crush during the movement of \nthe troops took place at the Stone, Moskva, \nand,Yatiza bridges. \n\nWhile the troops, dividing into two parts \nwhen passing around the Kremlin, were throng- \ning the Moskvil and the Stone bridges, a great \nmany soldiers, taking advantage of the stop- \npage and congestion, turned back from the \nbridges and slipped stealthily and silently past \nthe church of Vasili the Beatified and under \nthe Borovitski gate, back up the hill to the \nRed Square where some instinct told them \nthey could easily take things not belonging to \nthem. Crowds of the kind seen at cheap sales \nfilled all the passages and alleys of the Bazaar. \nBut there were no dealers with voices of ingra- \ntiating affability inviting customers to enter; \nthere were no hawkers, nor the usual motley \ncrowd of female purchasers but only soldiers, \nin uniforms and overcoats though without \nmuskets, entering the Bazaar empty-handed \nand silently making their way out through \n\n\n\nBOOK ELEVEN \n\n\n\n501 \n\n\n\nits passages with bundles. Tradesmen and \ntheir assistants (of whom there were but \nfew) moved about among the soldiers quite \nbewildered. They unlocked their shops and \nlocked them up again, and themselves carried \ngoods away with the help of their assistants. On \nthe square in front of the Bazaar were drum- \nmers beating the muster call. But the roll of \nthe drums did not make the looting soldiers \nrun in the direction of the drum as formerly, \nbut made them, on the contrary, run farther \naway. Among the soldiers in the shops and \npassages some men were to be seen in gray \ncoats, with closely shaven heads. 1 Two officers, \none with a scarf over his uniform and mounted \non a lean, dark-gra'y horse, the other in an \novercoat and on foot, stood at the corner of \nthe Ilyfnka Street, talking. A third officer gal- \nloped up to them. \n\n"The general orders them all to be driven \nout at once, without fail. This is outrageous! \nHalf the men have dispersed." \n\n"Where are you off to? ... Where? . . ." he \nshouted to three infantrymen without muskets \nwho, holding up the skirts of their overcoats, \nwere slipping past him into the Bazaar pas- \nsage. "Stop, you rascals!" \n\n"But how are you going to stop them?" re- \nplied another officer. "There is no getting \nthem together. The array should push on be- \nfore the rest bolt, that's all!" &gt;T \n\n"How can one push on? They are stuck \nthere, wedged on the bridge, and don't move. \nShouldn't we put a cordon round to prevent \nthe rest from running away?" \n\n"Come, go in there and drive them out!" \nshouted the senior officer. \n\nThe officer in the scarf dismounted, called \nup a drummer, and went with him into the \narcade. Some soldiers started running away in \na group. A shopkeeper with red pimples on his \ncheeks near the nose, and a calm, persistent, \ncalculating expression on his plump face, hur- \nriedly and ostentatiously approached the of- \nficer, swinging his arms. \n\n"Your honor!" said he. "Be so good as to \nprotect us! We won't grudge trifles, you are \nwelcome to anything we shall be delighted! \nPray! . . . I'll fetch a piece of cloth at once for \nsuch an honorable gentleman, or even two \npieces with pleasure. For we feel how it is; but \nwhat's all this sheer robbery! If you please, \ncould not guards be placed if only to let us \nclose the shop. . . ." \n\n1 Prisoners who had been released from jail. \nTR. \n\n\n\nSeveral shopkeepers crowded round the of- \nficer. \n\n"Eh, what twaddle!" said one of them, a \nthin, stern-looking man. "When one's head is \ngone one doesn't weep for one's hair! Take \nwhat any of you like!" And flourishing his \narm energetically he turned sideways to the \nofficer. \n\n"It's all very well for you, Ivdn Sidorych, to \ntalk," said the first tradesman angrily. "Please \nstep inside, your honor!" \n\n"Talk indeed!" cried the thin one. "In my \nthree shops here I have a hundred thousand \nrubles' worth of goods. Can they be saved when \nthe army has gone? Eh, what people! 'Against \nGod's might our hands can't fight.' " \n\n"Come inside, your honor!" repeated the \nfirst tradesman, bowing. \n\nThe officer stood perplexed and his face \nshowed indecision. \n\n"It's not my business!" he exclaimed, and \nstrode on quickly down one of the passages. \n\nFrom one open shop came the sound of \nblows and vituperation, and just as the officer \ncame up to it a man in a gray coat with a shav- \nen head was flung out violently. \n\nThis man, bent double, rushed past the \ntradesman and the officer. The officer pounced \non the soldiers who were in the shops, but at \nthat moment fearful screams reached them \nfrom the huge crowd on the Moskvi bridge \nand the officer ran out into the square. \n\n"What is it? What is it?" he asked, but his \ncomrade was already galloping off past Vasili \nthe Beatified in the direction from which the \nscreams carne. \n\nThe officer mounted his horse and rode aft- \ner him. When he reached the bridge he saw \ntwo unlhnbered guns, the infantry crossing \nthe bridge, several overturned carts, and fright- \nened and laughing faces among the troops. Be- \nside the cannon a cart was standing to which \ntwo horses were harnessed. Four borzois with \ncollars were pressing close to the wheels. The \ncart was loaded high, and at the very top, be- \nside a child's chair with its legs in the air, sat \na peasant woman uttering piercing and des- \nperate shrieks. He was told by his fellow officers \nthat the screams of the crowd and the shrieks of \nthe woman were due to the fact that General \nErm61ov, coming up to the crowd and learning \nthat soldiers were dispersing among the shops \nwhile crowds of civilians blocked the bridge, \nhad ordered two guns to be unlimbered and \nmade a show of firing at the bridge. The crowd, \ncrushing one another, upsetting carts, and \n\n\n\n502 \n\nshouting and squeezing desperately, had \ncleared off the bridge and the troops were now \nmoving forward. \n\nCHAPTER XXII \n\nMEANWHILE, the city itself was deserted. There \nwas hardly anyone in the streets. The gates \nand shops were all closed, only here and there \nround the taverns solitary shouts or drunken \nsongs could be heard. Nobody drove through \nthe streets and footsteps were rarely heard. \nThe Povarskdya was quite still and deserted. \nThe huge courtyard of the RosttWs' house was \nlittered with wisps of hay and with dung from \nthe horses, and not a soul was to be seen there. \nIn the great drawing room of the house, which \nhad been left with all it contained, were two \npeople. They were the yard porter Ignat, and \nthe pageboy Mishka, Vasilich's grandson who \nhad stayed in Moscow with his grandfather. \nMishka had opened the clavichord and was \nstrumming on it with one finger. The yard \nporter, his arms akimbo, stood smiling with \nsatisfaction before the large mirror. \n\n"Isn't it fine, eh, Uncle Ignat?" said the boy, \nsuddenly beginning to strike the keyboard with \nboth hands. \n\n"Only fancy!" answered Ignat, surprised at \nthe broadening grin on his face in the mirror. \n\n"Impudence! Impudence!" they heard be- \nhind them the voice of Mavra Kuzmfnichna \nwho had entered silently. "How he's grinning, \nthe fat mug! Is that what you're here for? \nNothing's cleared away down there and Vasi- \nlich is worn out. Just you wait a bit!" \n\nIgnat left off smiling, adjusted his belt, and \nwent out of the room with meekly downcast \neyes. \n\n"Aunt, I did it gently," said the boy. \n\n"I'll give you something gently, you monkey \nyou!" cried Mdvra Kuzminichna, raising her \narm threateningly. "Go and get the samovar to \nboil for your grandfather." \n\nMdvra Kuzmfnichna flicked the dust off the \nclavichord and closed it, and with a deep sigh \nleft the drawing room and locked its main \ndoor. \n\nGoing out into the yard she paused to con- \nsider where she should go next to drink tea \nin the servants' wing with Vasflich, or into the \nstoreroom to put away what still lay about. \n\nShe heard the sound of quick footsteps in the \nquiet street. Someone stopped at the gate, and \nthe latch rattled as someone tried to open it. \n\nMavra Kuzminichna went to the gate. \n\n"Who do you want?" \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n"The count Count Ilya Andrevich Ros- \nt6v." \n\n"And who are you?" \n\n"An officer, I have to see him," came the \nreply in a pleasant, well-bred Russian voice. \n\nMavra Kuzmfnichna opened the gate and \nan officer of eighteen, with the round face of a \nRost6v, entered the yard. \n\n"They have gone away, sir. Went away yes- \nterday at vespertime," said Mdvra Kuzminich- \nna cordially. \n\nThe young officer standing in the gateway, \nas if hesitating whether to enter or not, clicked \nhis tongue. \n\n"Ah, how annoying!" he muttered. "I should \nhave come yesterday Ah, what a pity." \n\nMeanwhile, Mdvra Kuzminichna was atten- \ntively and sympathetically examining the fa- \nmiliar Rost6v features of tlie young man's face, \nhis tattered coat and trodden-down boots. \n\n"What did you want to see the count for?" \nshe asked. \n\n"Oh well ... it can't be helped!" said he in \na tone of vexation and placed his hand on the \ngate as if to leave. \n\nHe again paused in indecision. \n\n"You see," he suddenly said, "I am a kins- \nman of the count's and he has been very kind \nto me. As you see" (he glanced with an amused \nair and good-natured smile at his coat and \nboots) "my things are worn out and I have no \nmoney, so I was going to ask the count . . ." \n\nMdvra Kuzmfnichna did not let him finish. \n\n"Just wait a minute, sir. One little moment," \nsaid she. \n\nAnd as soon as the officer let go of the gate \nhandle she turned and, hurrying away on her \nold legs, went through the back yard to the \nservants' quarters. \n\nWhile Mdvra Kuzmfnichna was running to \nher room the officer walked about the yard gaz- \ning at his worn-out boots with lowered head \nand a faint smile on his lips. "What a pity I've \nmissed Uncle! What a nice old woman! Where \nhas she run off to? And how am I to find the \nnearest way to overtake my regiment, which \nmust by now be getting near the Rog6zhski \ngate?" thought he. Just then Mdvra Kuzmi- \nnichna appeared from behind the corner of \nthe house with a frightened yet resolute look, \ncarrying a rolled-up check kerchief in her \nhand. While still a few steps from the officer \nshe unfolded the kerchief and took out of it a \nwhite twenty- five-ruble assignat and hastily \nhanded it to him. \n\n"If his excellency had been at home, as a \n\n\n\nBOOK ELEVEN \n\nkinsman he would of course . . . but as it is . . ." \n\nMdvra Kuzminichna grew abashed and con- \nfused. The officer did not decline, but took the \nnote quietly and thanked her. \n\n"If the count had been at home . . ." Ma" vra \nKuzmfnichna went on apologetically. "Christ \nbe with you, sir! May God preserve you!" said \nshe, bowing as she saw him out. \n\nSwaying his head and smiling as if amused \nat himself, the officer ran almost at a trot \nthrough the deserted streets toward the Yauza \nbridge to overtake his regiment. \n\nBut Ma* vra Kuzminichna stood at the closed \ngate for some time with moist eyes, pensively \nswaying her head and feeling an unexpected \nflow of motherly tenderness and pity for the \nunknown young officer. \n\n\n\n53 \n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII \n\nFROM AN UNFINISHED HOUSE on the Varvdrka, \nthe ground floor of which was a dramshop, \ncame drunken shouts and songs. On benches \nround the tables in a dirty little room sat some \nten factory hands. Tipsy and perspiring, with \ndim eyes and wide-open mouths, they were all \nlaboriously singing some song or other. They \nwere singing discordantly, arduously, and with \ngreat effort, evidently not because they wished \nto sing, but because they wanted to show they \nwere drunk and on a spree. One, a tall, fair- \nhaired lad in a clean blue coat, was standing \nover the others. His face with its fine straight \nnose would have been handsome had it not \nbeen for his thin, compressed, twitching lips \nand dull, gloomy, fixed eyes. Evidently pos- \nsessed by some idea, he stood over those who \nwere singing, and solemnly and jerkily flour- \nished above their heads his white arm with the \nsleeve turned up to the elbow, trying unnatu- \nrally to spread out his dirty fingers. The sleeve \nof his coat kept slipping down and he always \ncarefully rolled it up again with his left hand, \nas if it were most important that the sinewy- \nwhite arm he was flourishing should be bare. \nIn the midst of the song cries were heard, and \nfighting and blows in the passage and porch. \nThe tall lad waved his arm. \n\n"Stop it!" he exclaimed peremptorily. \n"There's a fight, lads!" And, still rolling up his \nsleeve, he went out to the porch. \n\nThe factory hands followed him. These \nmen, who under the leadership of the tall lad \nwere drinking in the dramshop that morning, \nhad brought the publican some skins from the \nfactory and for this had had drink served them. \nThe blacksmiths from a neighboring smithy, \n\n\n\nhearing the sounds of revelry in the tavern . \nand supposing it to have been broken into, \nwished to force their way in too and a fight in \nthe porch had resulted. \n\nThe publican was fighting one of the smiths \nat the door, and when the workmen came out \nthe smith, wrenching himself free from the \ntavernkecper, fell face downward on the pave- \nment. \n\nAnother smith tried to enter the doorway, \npressing against the publican with his chest. \n\nThe lad with the turned-up sleeve gave the \nsmith a blow in the face and cried wildly: \n"They're fighting us, lads!" \n\nAt that moment the first smith got up and, \nscratching his bruised face to make it bleed, \nshouted in a tearful voice: "Police! Murder! \n. . . They've killed a man, lads!" \n\n"Oh, gracious me, a man beaten to death- \nkilled! . . ." screamed a woman coming out of \na gate close by. \n\nA crowd gathered round the bloodstained \nsmith. \n\n"Haven't you robbed people enough tak- \ning their last shirts?" said a voice addressing \nthe publican. "What have you killed a man \nfor, you thief?" \n\nThe tall lad, standing in the porch, turned \nhis bleared eyes from the publican to the smith \nand back again as if considering whom he \nought to fight now. \n\n"Murderer!" he shouted suddenly to the \npublican. "Bind him, lads!" \n\n"I daresay you would like to bind me!" \nshouted the publican, pushing away the men \nadvancing on him, and snatching his cap from \nhis head he flung it on the ground. \n\nAs if this action had some mysterious and \nmenacing significance, the workmen surround- \ning the publican paused in indecision. \n\n"I know the law very well, mates! I'll take \nthe matter to the captain of police. You think \nI won't get to him? Robbery is not permitted \nto anybody nowadays!" shouted the publican, \npicking up his cap. \n\n"Come along then! Come along then!" the \npublican and the tall young fellow repeated \none after the other, and they moved up the \nstreet together. \n\nThe bloodstained smith went beside them. \nThe factory hands and others followed be- \nhind, talking and shouting. \n\nAt the corner of the Moroseyka, opposite a \nlarge house with closed shutters and bearing a \nbootmaker's signboard, stood a score of thin, \nworn-out, gloomy-faced bootmakers, wearing \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\noveralls and long tattered coats. \n\n"He should pay folks off properly/' a thin \nworkingman, with frowning brows and a \nstraggly beard, was saying. \n\n"But he's sucked our blood and now he thinks \nhe's quit of us. He's been misleading us all \nthe week and now that he's brought us to this \npass he's made off." \n\nOn seeing the crowd and the bloodstained \nman the workman ceased speaking, and with \neager curiosity all the bootmakers joined the \nmoving crowd. \n\n"Where are all the folks going?" \n\n"Why, to the police, of course!" \n\n"I say, is it true that we have been beaten?" \n"And what did you think? Look what folks \nare saying." \n\nQuestions and answers were heard. The pub- \nlican, taking advantage of the increased crowd, \ndropped behind and returned to his tavern. \n\nThe tall youth, not noticing the disappear- \nance of his foe, waved his bare arm and went \non talking incessantly, attracting general at- \ntention to himself. It was around him that the \npeople chiefly crowded, expecting answers \nfrom him to the questions that occupied all \ntheir minds. \n\n"He must keep order, keep the law, that's \nwhat the government is there for. Am I not \nright, good Christians?" said the tall youth, \nwith a scarcely perceptible smile. "He thinks \nthere's no government! How can one do with- \nout government? Or else there would be plenty \nwho'd rob us." \n\n"Why talk nonsense?" rejoined voices in the \ncrowd. "Will they give up Moscow like this? \nThey told you that for fun, and you believed \nit! Aren't there plenty of troops on the march? \nLet him in, indeed! That's what the govern- \nment is for. You'd better listen to what people \nare saying," said some of the mob pointing to \nthe tall youth. \n\nBy the wall of China-Town a smaller group \nof people were gathered round a man in a \nfrieze coat who held a paper in his hand. \n\n"An ukase, they are reading an ukdsel Read- \ning an ukise!" cried voices in the crowd, and \nthe people rushed toward the reader. \n\nThe man in the frieze coat was reading the \nbroadsheet of August 31. When the crowd col- \nlected round him he seemed confused, but at \nthe demand of the tall lad who had pushed his \nway up to him, he began in a rather tremulous \nvoice to read the sheet from the beginning. \n\n"Early tomorrow I shall go to his Serene \nHighness/' he read ("Sirin Highness" said the \n\n\n\ntall fellow with a triumphant smile on his lips \nand a frown on his brow), "to consult with him, \nto act, and to aid the army to exterminate \nthese scoundrels. We too will take part . . ." \nthe reader went on, and then paused ("Do \nyou see," shouted the youth victoriously, "he's \n\ngoing to clear up the whole affair for you "), \n\n"in destroying them, and will send these visi- \ntors to the devil. I will come back to dinner, \nand we'll set to work. We will do, completely \ndo, and undo these scoundrels." \n\nThe last words were read out in the midst \nof complete silence. The tall lad hung his head \ngloomily. It was evident that no one had un- \nderstood the last part. In particular, the words \n"I will come back to dinner," evidently dis- \npleased both reader and audience. The peo- \nple's minds were tuned to a high pitch and \nthis was too simple and needlessly comprehen- \nsibleit was what any one of them might have \nsaid and therefore was what an ukase emanat- \ning from the highevSt authority should not say. \n\nThey all stood despondent and silent. The \ntall youth moved his lips and swayed from side \nto side. \n\n"We should ask him . . . that's he himself!" \n. . . "Yes, ask him indeed!" . . . "Why not? He'll \nexplain" . . . voices in the rear of the crowd \nwere suddenly heard saying, and the general \nattention turned to the police superintendent's \ntrap which drove into the square attended by \ntwo mounted dragoons. \n\nThe superintendent of police, who hadgone \nthat morning by Count Rostopchin's orders to \nburn the barges and had in connection with \nthat matter acquired a large sum of money \nwhich was at that moment in his pocket, on \nseeing a crowd bearing down upon him told \nhis coachman to stop. \n\n"What people are these?" he shouted to the \nmen, who were moving singly and timidly in \nthe direction of his trap. \n\n"What people are these?" he shouted again, \nreceiving no answer. \n\n"Your honor . . ." replied the shopman in \nthe frieze coat, "your honor, in accord with \nthe proclamation of his highest excellency the \ncount, they desire to serve, not sparing their \nlives, and it is not any kind of riot, but as his \nhighest excellence said . . ." \n\n"The count has not left, he is here, and an \norder will be issued concerning you," said the \nsuperintendent of police. "Go on!" he ordered \nhis coachman. \n\nThe crowd halted, pressing around those \nwho had heard what the superintendent had \n\n\n\nBOOK ELEVEN \n\n\n\n55 \n\n\n\nsaid, and looking at the departing trap. \n\nThe superintendent of police turned round \nat that moment with a scared look, said some- \nthing to his coachman, and his horses increased \ntheir speed. \n\n"It's a fraud, lads! Lead the way to him, \nhimself!" shouted the tall youth. "Don't let \nhim go, lads! Let him answer us! Keep him!" \nshouted different voices, and the people dashed \nin pursuit of the trap. \n\nFollowing the superintendent of police and \ntalking loudly the crowd went in the direction \nof the Lubyanka Street. \n\n"There now, the gentry and merchants have \ngone away and left us to perish. Do they think \nwe're dogs?" voices in the crowd were heard \nsaying more and more frequently. \n\nCHAPTER XXIV \n\nON THE EVENING of the first of September, after \nhis interview with Kutuzov, Count Rostopchin \nhad returned to Moscow mortified and of- \nfended because he had not been invited to at- \ntend the council of war, and because Kutuzov \nhad paid no attention to his offer to take part \nin the defense of the city; amazed also at the \nnovel outlook revealed to him at the camp, \nwhich treated the tranquillity of the capital \nand its patriotic fervor as not merely secondary \nbut quite irrelevant and unimportant matters. \nDistressed, offended, and surprised by all this, \nRostopchfn had returned to Moscow. After \nsupper he lay down on a sofa without undress- \ning, and was awakened soon after midnight \nby a courier bringing him a letter from Kutu- \nzov. This letter requested the count to send \npolice officers to guide the troops through the \ntown, as the army was retreating to the Ryazan \nroad beyond Moscow. This was not news to \nRostopchin. He had known that Moscow \nwould be abandoned not merely since his in- \nterview the previous day with Kutuzov on the \nPokl6nny Hill but ever since the battle of \nBorodin6, for all the generals who came to \nMoscow after that battle had said unanimously \nthat it was impossible to fight another battle, \nand since then the government property had \nbeen removed every night, and half the inhabi- \ntants had left the city with Rostopchfn's own \npermission. Yet all the same this information \nastonished and irritated the count, coming as \nit did in the form of a simple note with an or- \nder from Kutuzov, and received at night, break- \ning in on his beauty sleep. \n\nWhen later on in his memoirs Count Ros- \ntopchin explained his actions at this time, he \n\n\n\nrepeatedly says that he was then actuated by \ntwo important considerations: to maintain \ntranquillity in Moscow and expedite the de- \nparture of the inhabitants. If one accepts this \ntwofold aim all Rostopchfn's actions appear ir- \nreproachable. "Why were the holy relics, the \narms, ammunition, gunpowder, and stores of \ncorn not removed? Why were thousands of in- \nhabitants deceived into believing that Moscow \nwould not be given up and thereby ruined?" \n"To preserve the tranquillity of the city," ex- \nplains Count Rostopchin. "Why were bundles \nof useless papers from the government offices, \nand Leppich's balloon and other articles re- \nmoved?" "To leave the town empty," explains \nCount Rostopchin. One need only admit that \npublic tranquillity is in danger and any action \nfinds a justification. \n\nAll the horrors of the reign of terror were \nbased only on solicitude for public tranquil- \nlity. \n\nOn what, then, was Count Rostopchfn's fear \nfor the tranquillity of Moscow based in 1812? \nWhat reason was there for assuming any prob- \nability of an uprising in the city? The inhabi- \ntants were leaving it and the retreating troops \nwere filling it. Why should that cause the \nmasses to riot? \n\nNeither in Moscow nor anywhere in Russia \ndid anything resembling an insurrection ever \noccur when the enemy entered a town. More \nthan ten thousand people were still in Moscow \non the first and second of September, and except \nfor a mob in the governor's courtyard, assem- \nbled there at his bidding, nothing happened. \nIt is obvious that there would have been even \nless reason to expect a disturbance among the \npeople if after the battle of Borodin6, when \nthe surrender of Moscow became certain or at \nleast probable, Rostopchin instead of exciting \nthe people by distributing arms and broad- \nsheets had taken steps to remove all the holy \nrelics, the gunpowder, munitions, and money, \nand had told the population plainly that the \ntown would be abandoned. \n\nRostopchin, though he had patriotic senti- \nments, was a sanguine and impulsive man who \nhad always moved in the highest administra- \ntive circles and had no understanding at all of \nthe people he supposed himself to be guiding. \nEver since the enemy's entry into Smolensk he \nhad in imagination been playing the role of \ndirector of the popular feeling of "the heart of \nRussia." Not only did it seem to him (as to all \nadministrators) that he controlled the external \nactions of Moscow's inhabitants, but he also \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nthought he controlled their mental attitude by \nmeans of his broadsheets and posters, written \nin a coarse tone which the people despise in \ntheir own class and do not understand from \nthose in authority. Rostopchfn was so pleased \nwith the fine role of leader of popular feeling, \nand had grown so used to it, that the necessity \nof relinquishing that role and abandoning \nMoscow without any heroic display took him \nunawares and he suddenly felt the ground slip \naway from under his feet, so that he positively \ndid not-know what to do. Though he knew it \nwas coming, he did not till the last moment \nwholeheartedly believe that Moscow would be \nabandoned, and did not prepare for it. The in- \nhabitants left against his wishes. If the govern- \nment offices were removed, this was only done \non the demand of officials to whom the count \nyielded reluctantly. He was absorbed in the \nrole he had created for himself. As is often the \ncase with those gifted with an ardent imagina- \ntion, though he had long known that Moscow \nwould be abandoned he knew it only with his \nintellect, he did not believe it in his heart and \ndid not adapt himself mentally to this new \nposition of affairs. \n\nAll his painstaking and energetic activity \n(in how far it was useful and had any effect on \nthe people is another question) had been sim- \nply directed toward arousing in the masses his \nown feeling of patriotic hatred of the French. \n\nBut when events assumed their true histori- \ncal character, when expressing hatred for the \nFrench in words proved insufficient, when it \nwas not even possible to express that hatred by \nfighting a battle, when self-confidence was of \nno avail in relation to the one question before \nMoscow, when the whole population streamed \nout of Moscow as one man, abandoning their \nbelongings and proving by that negative ac- \ntion all the depth of their national feeling, \nthen the role chosen by Rostopchin suddenly \nappeared senseless. He unexpectedly felt him- \nself ridiculous, weak, and alone, with no ground \nto stand on. \n\nWhen, awakened from his sleep, he received \nthat cold, peremptory note from Kutiizov, he \nfelt the more irritated the more he felt himself \nto blame. All that he had been specially put in \ncharge of, the state property which he should \nhave removed, was still in Moscow and it was \nno longer possible to take the whole of it away. \n\n"Who is to blame for it? Who has let things \ncome to such a pass?" he ruminated. "Not I, \nof course. I had everything ready. I had Mos- \ncow firmly in hand. And this is what they have \n\n\n\nlet it come to! Villains! Traitors!" he thought, \nwithout clearly defining who the villains and \ntraitors were, but feeling it necessary to hate \nthose traitors whoever they might be who were \nto blame for the false and ridiculous position \nin which he found himself. \n\nAll that night Count Rostopchfn issued or- \nders, for which people came to him from all \nparts of Moscow. Those about him had never \nseen the count so morose and irritable. \n\n"Your excellency, the Director of the Regis- \ntrar's Department has sent for instructions .... \nFrom the Consistory, from the Senate, from \nthe University, from the Foundling Hospital, \nthe Suffragan has sent . . . asking for informa- \ntion. . . . What are your orders about the Fire \nBrigade? From the governor of the prison . . . \nfrom the superintendent of the lunatic asy- \nlum . . ." All night long such announcements \nwere continually being received by the count. \n\nTo all these inquiries he gave brief and an- \ngry replies indicating that orders from him \nwere not now needed, that the whole affair, \ncarefully prepared by him, had now been \nruined by somebody, and that that somebody \nwould have to bear the whole responsibility \nfor all that might happen. \n\n"Oh, tell that blockhead," he said in reply \nto the question from the Registrar's Depart- \nment, "that he should remain to guard his \ndocuments. Now why are you asking silly ques- \ntions about the Fire Brigade? They have horses, \nlet them be off to Vladimir, and not leave them \nto the French." \n\n"Your excellency, the superintendent of the \nlunatic asylum has come: what are your com- \nmands?" \n\n"My commands? Let them go away, that's all. \n. . . And let the lunatics out into the town. \nWhen lunatics command our armies God evi- \ndently means these other madmen to be free." \n\nIn reply to an inquiry about the convicts in \nthe prison, Count Rostopchfn shouted angrily \nat the governor: \n\n"Do you expect me to give you two battal- \nionswhich we have not got for a convoy? Re- \nlease them, that's all about it!" \n\n"Your excellency, there are some political \nprisoners, Meshk6v, Vereshchagin . . ." \n\n"Vereshchdgin! Hasn't he been hanged yet?" \nshouted Rostopchfn. "Bring him to me!" \n\nCHAPTER XXV \n\nTOWARD NINE O'CLOCK in the morning, when \nthe troops were already moving through Mos- \ncow, nobody came to the count any more for \n\n\n\nBOOK ELEVEN \n\ninstructions. Those who were able to get away \nwere going of their own accord, those who re- \nmained behind decided for themselves what \nthey must do. \n\nThe count ordered his carriage that he might \ndrive to Sok61niki, and sat in his study with \nfolded hands, morose, sallow, and taciturn. \n\nIn quiet and untroubled times it seems to \nevery administrator that it is only by his ef- \nforts that the whole population under his rule \nis kept going, and in this consciousness of be- \ning indispensable every administrator finds the \nchief reward of his labor and efforts. While the \nsea of history remains calm the ruler-adminis- \ntrator in his frail bark, holding on with a boat \nhook to the ship of the people and himself \nmoving, naturally imagines that his efforts \nmove the ship he is holding on to. But as soon \nas a storm arises and the sea begins to heave \nand the ship to move, such a delusion is no \nlonger possible. The ship moves independent- \nly with its own enormous motion, the boat \nhook no longer reaches the moving vessel, and \nsuddenly the administrator, instead of appear- \ning a ruler and a source of power, becomes an \ninsignificant, useless, feeble man. \n\nRostopchfn felt this, and it was this which \nexasperated him. \n\nThe superintendent of police, whom the \ncrowd had stopped, went in to see him at the \nsame time as an adjutant who informed the \ncount that the horses were harnessed. They \nwere both pale, and the superintendent of \npolice, after reporting that he had executed \nthe instructions he had received, informed the \ncount that an immense crowd had collected \nin the courtyard and wished to see him. \n\nWithout saying a word Rostopchf n rose and \nwalked hastily to his light, luxurious drawing \nroom, went to the balcony door, took hold of \nthe handle, let it go again, and went to the \nwindow from which he had a better view of \nthe whole crowd. The tall lad was standing in \nfront, flourishing his arm and saying some- \nthing with a stern look. The bloodstained smith \nstood beside him with a gloomy face. A drone \nof voices was audible through the closed win- \ndow. \n\n"Is my carriage ready?" asked Rostopchfn, \nstepping back from the window. \n\n"It is, your excellency," replied the adjutant. \n\nRostopchfn went again to the balcony door. \n\n"But what do they want?" he asked the su- \nperintendent of police. \n\n"Your excellency, they say they have got \nready, according to your orders, to go against \n\n\n\n507 \n\nthe French, and they shouted something about \ntreachery. But it is a turbulent crowd, your \nexcellency I hardly managed to get away from \nit. Your excellency, I venture to suggest . . ." \n\n"You may go. I don't need you to tell me \nwhat to do!" exclaimed Rostopchin angrily. \n\nHe stood by the balcony door looking at the \ncrowd. \n\n"This is what they have done with Russia! \nThis is what they have done with me!" thought \nhe, full of an irrepressible fury that welled up \nwithin him against the someone to whom what \nwas happening might be attributed. As often \nhappens with passionate people, he was mas- \ntered by anger but was still seeking an object \non which to vent it. "Here is that mob, the \ndregs of the people," he thought as he gazed \nat the crowd: "this rabble they have roused by \ntheir folly! They want a victim," he thought \nas he looked at the tall lad flourishing his arm. \nAnd this thought occurred to him just because \nhe himself desired a victim, something on \nwhich to vent his rage. \n\n"Is the carriage ready?" he asked again. \n\n"Yes, your excellency. What are your orders \nabout Vereshchagin? He is waiting at the \nporch," said the adjutant. \n\n"Ah!" exclaimed Rostopchfn, as if struck by \nan unexpected recollection. \n\nAnd rapidly opening the door he went reso- \nlutely out onto the balcony. The talking in- \nstantly ceased, hats and caps were doffed, and \nall eyes were raised to the count. \n\n"Good morning, lads!" said the count brisk- \nly and loudly. "Thank you for coming. I'll \ncome out to you in a moment, but we must first \nsettle with the villain. We must punish the \nvillain who has caused the ruin of Moscow. \nWait for me!" \n\nAnd the count stepped as briskly back into \nthe room and slammed the door behind him. \n\nA murmur of approbation and satisfaction \nran through the crowd. "He'll settle with all \nthe villains, you'll seel And you said the French \n. . . He'll show you what law is!" the mob were \nsaying as if reproving one another for their \nlack of confidence. \n\nA few minutes later an officer came hurried- \nly out of the front door, gave an order, and \nthe dragoons formed up in line. The crowd \nmoved eagerly from the balcony toward the \nporch. Rostopchfn, coming out there with \nquick angry steps, looked hastily around as if \nseeking someone. \n\n"Where is he?" he inquired. And as he spoke \nhe saw a young man coming round the corner \n\n\n\n508 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nof the house between two dragoons. He had a \nlong thin neck, and his head, that had been \nhalf shaved, was again covered by short hair. \nThis young man was dressed in a threadbare \nblue cloth coat lined with fox fur, that had \nonce been smart, and dirty hempen convict \ntrousers, over which were pulled his thin, dirty, \ntrodden-down boots. On his thin, weak legs \nwere heavy chains which hampered his irreso- \nlute movements. \n\n"Ah!" said Rostopchin, hurriedly turning \naway his eyes from the young man in the fur- \nlined coat and pointing to the bottom step of \nthe porch. "Put him there." \n\nThe young man in his clattering chains \nstepped clumsily to the spot indicated, hold- \ning away with one finger the coat collar which \nchafed his neck, turned his long neck twice \nthis way and that, sighed, and submissively \nfolded before him his thin hands, unused to \nwork. \n\nFor several seconds while the young man \nwas taking his place on the step the silence \ncontinued. Only among the back rows of the \npeople, who were all pressing toward the one \nspot, could sighs, groans, and the shuffling of \nfeet be heard. \n\nWhile waiting for the young man to take his \nplace on the step Rostopchin stood frowning \nand rubbing his face with his hand. \n\n"Lads!" said he, with a metallic ring in his \nvoice. "This man, Vereshchdgin, is the scoun- \ndrel by whose doing Moscow is perishing." \n\nThe young man in the fur-lined coat, stoop- \ning a little, stood in a submissive attitude, his \nfingers clasped before him. His emaciated \nyoung face, disfigured by the half-shaven head, \nhung down hopelessly. At the count's first \nwords he raised it slowly and looked up at him \nas if wishing to say something or at least to \nmeet his eye. But Rostopchin did not look at \nhim. A vein in the young man's long thin neck \nswelled like a cord and went blue behind the \near, and suddenly his face flushed. \n\nAll eyes were fixed on him. He looked at \nthe crowd, and rendered more hopeful by the \nexpression he read on the faces there, he smiled \nsadly and timidly, and lowering his head shift- \ned his feet on the step. \n\n"He has betrayed his Tsar and his country, \nhe had gone over to Bonaparte. He alone of \nall the Russians has disgraced the Russian \nname, he has caused Moscow to perish," said \nRostopchin in a sharp, even voice, but sudden- \nly he glanced down at Vereshchagin who con- \ntinued to stand in the same submissive atti- \n\n\n\ntude. As if inflamed by the sight, he raised his \narm and addressed the people, almost shout- \ning: \n\n"Deal with him as you think fit! I hand him \nover to you." \n\nThe crowd remained silent and only pressed \ncloser and closer to one another. To keep one \nanother back, to breathe in that stifling atmos- \nphere, to be unable to stir, and to await some- \nthing unknown, uncomprehendecl, and terri- \nble, was becoming unbearable. Those stand- \ning in front, who had seen and heard what had \ntaken place before them, all stood with wide- \nopen eyes and mouths, straining with all their \nstrength, and held back the crowd that was \npushing behind them. \n\n"Beat him! . . . Let the traitor perish and \nnot disgrace the Russian name!" shouted Ros- \ntopchin. "Cut him clown. I command it." \n\nHearing not so much the words as the angry \ntone of Rostopchin's voice, the crowd moaned \nand heaved forward, but again paused. \n\n"Count!" exclaimed the timid yet theatrical \nvoice of Vereshchdgin in the midst of the mo- \nmentary silence that ensued, "Count! One God \nis above us both. . . ." He lifted his head and \nagain the thick vein in his thin neck filled with \nblood and the color rapidly came and went in \nhis face. \n\nHe did not finish what he wished to say. \n\n"Cut him down! I command it . . ." shouted \nRostopchfn, suddenly growing pale like Vere- \nshchagin. \n\n"Draw sabers!" cried the dragoon officer, \ndrawing his own. \n\nAnother still stronger wave flowed through \nthe crowd and reaching the front ranks carried \nit swaying to the very steps of the porch. The \ntall youth, with a stony look on his face, and \nrigid and uplifted arm, stood beside Veresh- \nchdgin. \n\n"Saber him!" the dragoon officer almost \nwhispered. \n\nAnd one of the soldiers, his face all at once \ndistorted with fury, struck Vereshchdgin on \nthe head with the blunt side of his saber. \n\n"Ah!" cried Vereshchdgin in meek surprise, \nlooking round with a frightened glance as if \nnot understanding why this was done to him. \nA similar moan of surprise and horror ran \nthrough the crowd. "O Lord!" exclaimed a \nsorrowful voice. \n\nBut after the exclamation of surprise that \nhad escaped from Vereshchdgin he uttered a \nplaintive cry of pain, and that cry was fatal. \nThe barrier of human feeling, strained to the \n\n\n\nBOOK ELEVEN \n\n\n\nutmost, that had held the crowd in check sud- \ndenly broke. The crime had begun and must \nnow be completed. The plaintive moan of re- \nproach was drowned by the threatening and \nangry roar of the crowd. Like the seventh and \nlast wave that shatters a ship, that last irresisti- \nble wave burst from the rear and reached the \nfront ranks, carrying them of! their feet and \nengulfing them all. The dragoon was about to \nrepeat his blow. Vereshchagin with a cry of \nhorror, covering his head with his hands, rushed \ntoward the crowd. The tall youth, against \nwhom he stumbled, seized his thin neck with \nhis hands and, yelling wildly, fell with him un- \nder the feet of the pressing, struggling crowd. \n\nSome beat and tore at Vcreshcndgin, others \nat the tall youth. And the screams of those \nthat were being trampled on and of those who \ntried to rescue the tall lad only increased the \nfury of the crowd. It was a long time before \nthe dragoons could extricate the bleeding \nyouth, beaten almost to death. And for a long \ntime, despite the feverish haste with which the \nmob tried to end the work that had been be- \ngun, those who were hitting, throttling, and \ntearing at Vereshchagin were unable to kill \nhim, for the crowd pressed from all sides, \nswaying as one mass with them in the center \nand rendering it impossible for them either to \nkill him or let him go. \n\n"Hit him with an ax, eh! . . . Crushed? . . . \nTraitor, he sold Christ . . . Still alive . . . tena- \ncious . . . serve him right! Torture serves a thief \nright. Use the hatchet! . . . What still alive?" \n\nOnly when the victim ceased to struggle and \nhis cries changed to a long-drawn, measured \ndeath rattle did the crowd around his pros- \ntrate, bleeding corpse begin rapidly to change \nplaces. Each one came up, glanced at what had \nbeen done, and with horror, reproach, and as- \ntonishment pushed back again. \n\n"O Lord! The people are like wild beasts! \nHow could he be alive?" voices in the crowd \ncould be heard saying. "Quite a young fellow \ntoo . . . must have been a merchant's son. What \nmen! . . . and they say he's not the right one. \n. . . How not the right one? . . . O Lord! And \nthere's another has been beaten too they say \nhe's nearly done for. . . . Oh, the people . . . \nAren't they afraid of sinning? . . ." said the \nsame mob now, looking with pained distress at \nthe dead body with its long, thin, half-severed \nneck and its livid face stained with blood and \ndust. \n\nA painstaking police officer, considering the \npresence of a corpse in his excellency's court- \n\n\n\nyard unseemly, told the dragoons to take it \naway. Two dragoons took it by its distorted legs \nand dragged it along the ground. The gory, \ndust-stained, half-shaven head with its long \nneck trailed twisting along the ground. The \ncrowd shrank back from it. \n\nAt the moment when Vereshchdgin fell and \nthe crowd closed in with savage yells and swayed \nabout him, Rostopchin suddenly turned pale \nand, instead of going to the back entrance \nwhere his carriage awaited him, went with \nhurried steps and bent head, not knowing \nwhere and why, along the passage leading to \nthe rooms on the ground floor. The count's \nface was white and he could not control the \nfeverish twitching of his lower jaw. \n\n"This way, your excellency . . . Where are \nyou going? . . . This way, please . . ." said a \ntrembling, frightened voice behind him. \n\nCount Rostopchin was unable to reply and, \nturning obediently, went in the direction in- \ndicated. At the back entrancestood his caliche. \nThe distant roar of the yelling crowd was audi- \nble even there. He hastily took his seat and \ntold the coachman to drive him to his country \nhouse in Sokolniki. \n\nWhen they reached the Myasnitski Street \nand could no longer hear the shouts of the \nmob, the count began to repent. He remem- \nbered with dissatisfaction the agitation and \nfear he had betrayed before his subordinates. \n"The mob is terrible disgusting," he said to \nhimself in French. "They are like wolves whom \nnothing but flesh can appease." "Count! One \nGod is above us both!" Vereshcha* gin's words \nsuddenly recurred to him, and a disagreeable \nshiver ran down his back. But this was only a \nmomentary feeling and Count Rostopchin \nsmiled disdainfully at himself. "I had other \nduties," thought he. "The people had to be \nappeased. Many other victims have perished \nand are perishing for the public good" and \nhe began thinking of his social duties to his \nfamily and to the city entrusted to him, and \nof himself not himself as Theodore Vasilye- \nvich Rostopchin (he fancied that Theodore \nVasflyevich Rostopchfn was sacrificing him- \nself for the public good) but himself as gov- \nernor, the representative of authority and of \nthe Tsar. "Had I been simply Theodore Vasfl- \nyevich my course of action would have been \nquite different, but it was my duty to safe- \nguard my life and dignity as commander in \nchief." \n\nLightly swaying on the flexible springs of nis \ncarriage and no longer hearing the terrible \n\n\n\n5 io \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nsounds of the crowd, Rostopchfn grew physi- \ncally calm and, as always happens, as soon as \nhe became physically tranquil his mind de- \nvised reasons why he should be mentally tran- \nquil too. The thought which tranquillized Ros- \ntopchfn was not a new one. Since the world be- \ngan and men have killed one another no one \nhas ever committed such a crime against his \nfellow man without comforting himself with \nthis same idea. This idea is le bien public, the \nhypothetical welfare of other people. \n\nTo a man not swayed by passion that wel- \nfare is never certain, but he who commits such \na crime always knows just where that welfare \nlies. And Rostopchin now knew it. \n\nNot only did his reason not reproach him \nfor what he had done, but he even found cause \nfor self-satisfaction in having so successfully \ncontrived to avail himself of a convenient op- \nportunity to punish a criminal and at the same \ntime pacify the mob. \n\n"Vereshchdgin was tried and condemned to \ndeath," thought Rostopchin (though the Sen- \nate had only condemned Vereshchagin to hard \nlabor), "he was a traitor and a spy. I could not \nlet him go unpunished and so I have killed \ntwo birds with one stone: to appease the mob \nI gave them a victim and at the same time pun- \nished a miscreant." \n\nHaving reached his country house and be- \ngun to give orders about domestic arrange- \nments, the count grew quite tranquil. \n\nHalf an hour later he was driving with his \nfast horses across the Sok61niki field, no longer \nthinking of what had occurred but considering \nwhat was to come. He was driving to the Yaiiza \nbridge where he had heard that Kutuzov was. \nCount Rostopchfn was mentally preparing the \nangry and stinging reproaches he meant to \naddress to Kutuzov for his deception. He \nwould make that foxy old courtier feel that \nthe responsibility for all the calamities that \nwould follow the abandonment of the city and \nthe ruin of Russia (as Rostopchin regarded it) \nwould fall upon his doting old head. Planning \nbeforehand what he would say to Kutuzov, \nRostopchfn turned angrily in his caliche and \ngazed sternly from side to side. \n\nThe Sok61niki field was deserted. Only at \nthe end of it, in front of the almshouse and the \nlunatic asylum, could be seen some people in \nwhite and others like them walking singly \nacross the field shouting and gesticulating. \n\nOne of these was running to cross the path \nof Count Rostopchfn's carriage, and the count \nhimself, his coachman, jnd his dragoons looked \n\n\n\nwith vague horror and curiosity at these re- \nleased lunatics and especially at the one run- \nning toward them. \n\nSwaying from side to side on his long, thin \nlegs in his fluttering dressing gown, this luna- \ntic was running impetuously, his gaze fixed on \nRostopchin, shouting something in a hoarse \nvoice and making signs to him to stop. The \nlunatic's solemn, gloomy face was thin and \nyellow, with its beard growing in uneven tufts. \nHis black, agate pupils with saffron-yellow \nwhites moved restlessly near the lower eyelids. \n\n"Stop! Pull up, I tell you!" he cried in a \npiercing voice, and again shouted something \nbreathlessly with emphatic intonations and \ngestures. \n\nComing abreast of the caliche he ran be- \nside it. \n\n"Thrice have they slain me, thrice have I \nrisen from the dead. They stoned me, crucified \nme ... I shall rise . . . shall rise . . . shall rise. \nThey have torn my body. The kingdom of God \nwill be overthrown . . . Thrice will I overthrow \nit and thrice re-establish it!" he cried, raising \nhis voice higher and higher. \n\nCount Rostopchin suddenly grew pale as he \nhad done when the crowd closed in on Veresh- \ncMgin. He turned away. "Go fas ... faster!" \nhe cried in a trembling voice to his coachman. \nThe caliche flew over the ground as fast as the \nhorses could draw it, but for a long time Count \nRostopchin still heard the insane despairing \nscreams growing fainter in the distance, while \nhis eyes saw nothing but the astonished, fright- \nened, bloodstained face of "the traitor" in the \nfur-lined coat. \n\nRecent as that mental picture was, Rostop- \nchfn already felt that it had cut deep into his \nheart and drawn blood. Even now he felt clear- \nly that the gory trace of that recollection would \nnot pass with time, but that the terrible mem- \nory would, on the contrary, dwell in his heart \never more cruelly and painfully to the end of \nhis life. He seemed still to hear the sound of \nhis own words: "Cut him down! I command \nit " \n\n"Why did I utter those words? It was by some \naccident I said them. ... I need not have said \nthem," he thought. "And then nothing would \nhave happened." He saw the frightened and \nthen infuriated face of the dragoon who dealt \nthe blow, the look of silent, timid reproach \nthat boy in the fur-lined coat had turned upon \nhim. "But I did not do it for my own sake. I \nwas bound to act that way. . . . The mob, the \ntraitor . . . the public welfare," thought he. \n\n\n\nBOOK ELEVEN \n\n\n\nTroops were still crowding at the Yauza \nbridge. It was hot. Kutuzov, dejected and \nfrowning, sat on a bench by the bridge toying \nwith his whip in the sand when a caliche \ndashed up noisily. A man in a general's uni- \nform with plumes in his hat went up to Kutti- \nzov and said something in French. It was Count \nRostopchfn. He told Kutuzov that he had come \nbecause Moscow, the capital, was no more and \nonly the army remained. \n\n"Things would have been different if your \nSerene Highness had not told me that you \nwould not abandon Moscow without another \nbattle; all this would not have happened," he \nsaid. \n\nKutuzov looked at Rostopchfn as if, not \ngrasping what was said to him, he was trying \nto read something peculiar written at that mo- \nment on the face of the man addressing him. \nRostopchfn grew confused and became silent. \nKutuzov slightly shook his head and not tak- \ning his penetrating gaze from Rostopchfn's \nface muttered softly: \n\n"No! I shall not give up Moscow without a \nbattle!" \n\nWhether Kutuzovwas thinkingofsomething \nentirely different when he spoke those words, \nor uttered them purposely, knowing them to \nbe meaningless, at any rate Rostopchfn made \nno reply and hastily left him. And strange to \nsay, the Governor of Moscow, the proud Count \nRostopchfn, took up a Cossack whip and went \nto the bridge where he began with shouts to \ndrive on the carts that blocked the way. \n\nCHAPTER XXVI \n\nTOWARD FOUR O'CLOCK in the afternoon Mur- \nat's troops were entering Moscow. In front rode \na detachment of Wiirttemberg hussars and be- \nhind them rode the King of Naples himself \naccompanied by a numerous suite. \n\nAbout the middle of the Arbat Street, near \nthe Church of the Miraculous Icon of St. \nNicholas, Murat halted to await news from the \nadvanced detachment as to the condition in \nwhich they had found the citadel, le Kremlin. \n\nAround Murat gathered a group of those \nwho had remained in Moscow. They all stared \nin timid bewilderment at the strange, long- \nhaired commander dressed up in feathers and \ngold. \n\n"Is that their Tsar himself? He's not bad!" \nlow voices could be heard saying. \n\nAn interpreter rode up to the group. \n\n"Take off your cap . . . your caps!" These \nwords went from one to another in the crowd. \n\n\n\nThe interpreter addressed an old porter and \nasked if it was far to the Kremlin. The porter, \nlistening in perplexity to the unfamiliar Polish \naccent and not realizing that the interpreter \nwas speaking Russian, did not understand \nwhat was being said to him and slipped be- \nhind the others. \n\nMurat approached the interpreter and told \nhim to ask where the Russian army was. One \nof the Russians understood what was asked \nand several voices at once began answering \nthe interpreter. A French officer, returning \nfrom the advanced detachment, rode up to \nMurat and reported that the gates of the cita- \ndel had been barricaded and that there was \nprobably an ambuscade there. \n\n"Good!" said Murat and, turning to one of \nthe gentlemen in his suite, ordered four light \nguns to be moved forward to fire at the gates. \n\nThe guns emerged at a trot from the column \nfollowing Murat and advanced up the Arbat. \nWhen they reached the end of the Vozdvfzhen- \nka Street they halted and drew up in the Square. \nSeveral French officers superintended the plac- \ning of the guns and looked at the Kremlin \nthrough field glasses. \n\nThe bells in the Kremlin were ringing for \nvespers, and this sound troubled the French. \nThey imagined it to be a call to arms. A few \ninfantrymen ran to the Kutdfyev Gate. Beams \nand wooden screens had been put there, and \ntwo musket shots rang out from under the gate \nas soon as an officer and men began to run \ntoward it. A general who was standing by the \nguns shouted some words of command to the \nofficer, and the latter ran back again with his \nmen . \n\nThe sound of three more shots came from \nthe gate. \n\nOne shot struck a French soldier's foot, and \nfrom behind the screens came the strange \nsound of a few voices shouting. Instantly as at \na word of command the expression of cheerful \nserenity on the faces of the French general, of- \nficers, and men changed to one of determined \nconcentrated readiness for strife and suffering. \nTo all of them from the marshal to the least \nsoldier, that place was not the Vozdvizhenka, \nMokhavaya, or Kutdfyev Street, nor the Trd- \nitsa Gate (places familiar in Moscow), but a \nnew battlefield which would probably prove \nsanguinary. And all made ready for that battle. \nThe cries from the gates ceased. The guns \nwere advanced, the artillerymen blew the ash \noff their linstocks, and an officer gave the word \n"Fire!" This was followed by two whistling \n\n\n\n5** \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nsounds of canister shot, one after another. The \nshot rattled against the stone of the gate and \nupon the wooden beams and screens, and two \nwavering clouds of smoke rose over the Square. \n\nA few instants after the echo of the reports \nresounding over the stone-built Kremlin had \ndied away the French heard a strange sound \nabove their head. Thousands of crows rose \nabove the walls and circled in the air, cawing \nand noisily flapping their wings. Together with \nthat sound came a solitary human cry from the \ngateway and amid the smoke appeared the fig- \nure of a bareheaded man in a peasant's coat. \nHe grasped a musket and took aim at the \nFrench. "Fire!" repeated the officer once more, \nand the reports of a musket and of two cannon \nshots were heard simultaneously. The gate was \nagain hidden by smoke. \n\nNothing more stirred behind the screens \nand the French infantry soldiers and officers \nadvanced to the gate. In the gateway lay three \nwounded and four dead. Two men in peasant \ncoats ran away at the foot of the wall, toward \nthe Znmenka. \n\n"Clear that away!" said the officer, pointing \nto the beams and the corpses, and the French \nsoldiers, after dispatching the wounded, threw \nthe corpses over the parapet. \n\nWho these men were nobody knew. "Clear \nthat away!" was all that was said of them, and \nthey were thrown over the parapet and re- \nmoved later on that they might not stink. \nThiers alone dedicates a few eloquent lines to \ntheir memory: "These wretches had occupied \nthe sacred citadel, having supplied themselves \nwith guns from the arsenal, and fired" (the \nwretches) "at the French. Some of them were \nsabered and the Kremlin was purged of their \npresence." \n\nMurat was informed that the way had been \ncleared. The French entered the gates and be- \ngan pitching their camp in the Senate Square. \nOut of the windows of the Senate House the \nsoldiers threw chairs into the Square for fuel \nand kindled fires there. \n\nOther detachments passed through the Kre*m- \nlin and encamped along the Moros^yka, the \nLubynka, and Pokr6vka Streets. Others quar- \ntered themselves along the Vozdvizhenka, the \nNik61ski, and the Tversk6y Streets. No masters \nof the houses being found any where, the French \nwere not billeted on the inhabitants as is usual \nin towns but lived in it as in a camp. \n\nThough tattered, hungry, worn out, and re- \nduced to a third of their original number, the \nFrench entered Moscow in good marching or- \n\n\n\nder. It was a weary and famished, but still a \nfighting and menacing army. But it remained \nan army only until its soldiers had dispersed \ninto their different lodgings. As soon ^.s the \nmen of the various regiments began td dis- \nperse among the wealthy and deserted hotises, \nthe army was lost forever and there came into \nbeing something nondescript, neither citizens \nnor soldiers but what are known as marauders. \nWhen five weeks later these same men left Mos- \ncow, they no longer formed an army. They \nwere a mob of marauders, each carrying a \nquantity of articles which seemed to him valu- \nable or useful. The aim of each man when he \nleft Moscow was no longer, as it had been, to \nconquer, but merely to keep what he had ac- \nquired. Like a monkey which puts its paw in- \nto the narrow neck of a jug, and having seized \na handful of nuts will not open its fist for fear \nof losing what it holds, and therefore perishes, \nthe French when they left Moscow had inevi- \ntably to perish because they carried their loot \nwith them, yet to abandon what they had stolen \nwas as impossible for them as it is for the mon- \nkey to open its paw and let go of its nuts. Ten \nminutes after each regiment had entered a \nMoscow district, not a soldier or officer was left. \nMen in military uniforms and Hessian boots \ncould be seen through the windows, laughing \nand walking through the rooms. In cellars and \nstorerooms similar men were busy among the \nprovisions, and in the yards unlocking or \nbreaking open coach house and stable doors, \nlighting fires in kitchens and kneading and \nbaking bread with rolled-up sleeves, and cook- \ning; or frightening, amusing, or caressing wom- \nen and children. There were many such men \nboth in the shops and houses but there was \nno army. \n\nOrder after order was issued by the French \ncommanders that day forbidding the men to \ndisperse about the town, sternly forbidding \nany violence to the inhabitants or any looting, \nand announcing a roll call for that very eve- \nning. But despite all these measures the men, \nwho had till then constituted an army, flowed \nall over the wealthy, deserted city with its com- \nforts and plentiful supplies. As a hungry herd \nof cattle keeps well together when crossing a \nbarren field, but gets out of hand and at once \ndisperses uncontrollably as soon as it reaches \nrich pastures, so did the army disperse all over \nthe wealthy city. \n\nNo residents were left in Moscow, and the \nsoldiers like water percolating through sand \nspread irresistibly through the city in all di- \n\n\n\nBOOK ELEVEN \n\n\n\n513 \n\n\n\nrections from the Kremlin into which they had \nfirst marched. The cavalry, on entering a mer- \nchant's house that had been abandoned and \nfinding there stabling more than sufficient for \ntheir horses, went on, all the same, to the next \nhouse which seemed to them better. Many of \nthem appropriated several houses, chalked their \nnames on them, and quarreled and even fought \nwith other companies for them. Before they \nhad had time to secure quarters the soldiers \nran out into the streets to see the city and, \nhearing that everything had been abandoned, \nrushed to places where valuables were to be \nhad for the taking. The officers followed to \ncheck the soldiers and were involuntarily drawn \ninto doing the same. In Carriage Row carriages \nhad been left in the shops, and generals flocked \nthere to select caleches and coaches for them- \nselves. The few inhabitants who had remained \ninvited commanding officers to their houses, \nhoping thereby to secure themselves from be- \ning plundered. There were masses of wealth \nand there seemed no end to it. All around the \nquarters occupied by the French were other \nregions still unexplored and unoccupied where, \nthey thought, yet greater riches might be \nfound. And Moscow engulfed the army ever \ndeeper and deeper. When water is spilled on \ndry ground both the dry ground and the water \ndisappear and mud results; and in the same \nway the entry of the famished army into the \nrich and deserted city resulted in fires and loot- \ning and the destruction of both the army and \nthe wealthy city. \n\nThe French attributed the Fire of Moscow \nau patriotisme feroce de Rostopchine? the \nRussians to the barbarity of the French. In \nreality, however, it was not, and could not be, \npossible to explain the burning of Moscow by \nmaking any individual, or any group of peo- \nple, responsible for it. Moscow was burned be- \ncause it found itself in a position in which any \ntown built of wood was bound to burn, quite \napart from whether it had, or had not, a hun- \ndred and thirty inferior fire engines. Deserted \nMoscow had to burn as inevitably as a heap of \nshavings has to burn on which sparks continu- \nally fall for several days. A town built of wood, \nwhere scarcely a clay passes without conflagra- \ntions when the house owners are in residence \nand a police force is present, cannot help burn- \ning when its inhabitants have left it and it is \noccupied by soldiers who smoke pipes, make \ncampfires of the Senate chairs in the Senate \n\n1 To Rostopchfn's ferocious patriotism. \n\n\n\nSquare, and cook themselves meals twice a day. \nIn peacetime it is only necessary to billet troops \nin the villages of any district and the number \nof fires in that district immediately increases. \nHow much then must the probability of fire \nbe increased in an abandoned, wooden town \nwhere foreign troops are quartered. "Le patrio- \ntisme feroce deRostopchine"and the barbarity \nof the French were not to blame in the matter. \nMoscow was set on fire by the soldiers' pipes, \nkitchens, and campfires, and by the careless- \nness of-enemy soldiers occupying houses they \ndid not own. Even if there was any arson (which \nis very doubtful, for no one had any reason to \nburn the houses in any case a troublesome \nand dangerous thing to do), arson cannot be \nregarded as the cause, for the same thing would \nhave happened without any incendiarism. \n\nHowever tempting it might be for the French \nto blame Rostopchfn's ferocity and for Rus- \nsians to blame the scoundrel Bonaparte, or \nlater on to place an heroic torch in the hands \nof their own people, it is impossible not to see \nthat there could be no such direct cause of the \nfire, for Moscow had to burn as every village, \nfactory, or house must burn which is left by its \nowners and in which strangers are allowed to \nlive and cook their porridge. Moscow was \nburned by its inhabitants, it is true, but by \nthose who had abandoned it and not by those \nwho remained in it. Moscow when occupied \nby the enemy did not remain intact like Berlin, \nVienna, and other towns, simply because its \ninhabitants abandoned it and did not wel- \ncome the French with bread and salt, nor bring \nthem the keys of the city. \n\nCHAPTER XXVII \n\nTHE ABSORPTION of the French by Moscow, ra- \ndiating starwise as it did, only reached the \nquarter where Pierre was staying by the eve- \nning of the second of September. \n\nAfter the last two days spent in solitude and \nunusual circumstances, Pierre was in a state \nbordering on insanity. He was completely ob- \nsessed by one persistent thought. He did not \nknow how or when this thought had taken \nsuch possession of him, but he remembered \nnothing of the past, understood nothing of \nthe present, and all he saw and heard ap- \npeared to him like a dream. \n\nHe had left home only to escape the intri- \ncate tangle of life's demands that enmeshed \nhim, and which in his present condition he was \nunable to unravel. He had gone to Joseph \nAlexe*evich's house, on the plea of sorting the \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\ndeceased's books and papers, only in search of \nrest from life's turmoil, for in his mind the \nmemory of Joseph Alexevich was connected \nwith a world of eternal, solemn, and calm \nthoughts, quite contrary to the restless confu- \nsion into which he felt himself being drawn. \nHe sought a quiet refuge, and in Joseph Alex- \nevich's study he really found it. When he sat \nwith his elbows on the dusty writing table in \nthe deathlike stillness of the study, calm and \nsignificant memories of the last few days rose \none after another in his imagination, particu- \nlarly of the battle of Borodin6 and of that \nvague sense of his own insignificance and in- \nsincerity compared with the truth, simplicity, \nand strength of the class of men he mentally \nclassed as they. When Gerdsim roused him \nfrom his reverie the idea occurred to him of \ntaking part in the popular defense of Moscow \nwhich he knew was projected. And with that \nobject he had asked Gerdsim to get him a peas- \nant's coat and a pistol, confiding to him his in- \ntentions of remaining in Joseph Alexevich's \nhouse and keeping his name secret. Then dur- \ning the first day spent in inaction and solitude \n(he tried several times to fix his attention on \nthe Masonic manuscripts, but was unable to \ndo so) the idea that had previously occurred to \nhim of the cabalistic significance of his name \nin connection with Bonaparte's more than \nonce vaguely presented itself. But the idea that \nhe, L'russe Besuhof, was destined to set a limit \nto the power of the Beast was as yet only one \nof the fancies that often passed through his \nmind and left no trace behind. \n\nWhen, having bought the coat merely with \nthe object of taking part among the people in \nthe defense of Moscow, Pierre had met the \nRost6vs and Natdsha had said to him: "Are \nyou remaining in Moscow? . . . How splendid!" \nthe thought flashed into his mind that it really \nwould be a good thing, even if Moscow were \ntaken, for him to remain there and do what \nhe was predestined to do. \n\nNext day, with the sole idea of not sparing \nhimself and not lagging in any way behind \nthem, Pierre went to the Three Hills gate. But \nwhen he returned to the house convinced that \nMoscow would not be defended, he suddenly \nfelt that what before had seemed to him mere- \nly a possibility had now become absolutely nec- \nessary and inevitable. He must remain in Mos- \ncow, concealing his name, and must meet Na- \npoleon and kill him, and either perish or put \nan end to the misery of all Europe which it \nseemed to him was solely due to Napoleon. \n\n\n\nPierre knew all the details of the attempt on \nBonaparte's life in 1809 by a German student \nin Vienna, and knew that the student had been \nshot. And the risk to which he would expose \nhis life by carrying out his design excited him \nstill more. \n\nTwo equally strong feelings drew Pierre ir- \nresistibly to this purpose. The first was a feel- \ning of the necessity of sacrifice and suffering in \nview of the common calamity, the same feeling \nthat had caused him to go to Mozhdysk on the \ntwenty-fifth and to make his way to the very \nthick of the battle and had now caused him to \nrun away from his home and, in place of the \nluxury and comfort to which he was accus- \ntomed, to sleep on a hard sofa without undress- \ning and eat the same food as Gerdsim. The oth- \ner was that vague and quite Russian feeling of \ncontempt for everything conventional, artifi- \ncial, and human for everything the majority \nof men regard as the greatest good in the world. \nPierre had first experienced this strange and \nfascinating feeling at the Slob6da Palace, when \nhe had suddenly felt that wealth, power, and \nlifeall that men so painstakingly acquire and \nguard if it has any worth has so only by rea- \nson of the joy with which it can all be renounced. \n\nIt was the feeling that induces a volunteer \nrecruit to spend his last penny on drink, and \na drunken man to smash mirrors or glasses for \nno apparent reason and knowing that it will \ncost him all the money he possesses: the feel- \ning which causes a man to perform actions \nwhich from an ordinary point of view are in- \nsane, to test, as it were, his personal power and \nstrength, affirming the existence of a higher, \nno n human criterion of life. \n\nFrom the very day Pierre had experienced \nthis feeling for the first time at the Slob6da \nPalace he had been continuously under its in- \nfluence, but only now found full satisfaction \nfor it. Moreover, at this moment Pierre was \nsupported in his design and prevented from \nrenouncing it by what he had already done in \nthat direction. If he were now to leave Mos- \ncow like everyone else, his flight from home, \nthe peasant coat, the pistol, and his announce- \nment to the Rost6vs that he would remain in \nMoscow would all become not merely mean- \ningless but contemptible and ridiculous, and \nto this Pierre was very sensitive. \n\nPierre's physical condition, as is always the \ncase, corresponded to his mental state. The \nunaccustomed coarse food, the vodka he drank \nduring those days, the absence of wine and \ncigars, his dirty unchanged linen, two almost \n\n\n\nBOOK ELEVEN \n\n\n\nsleepless nights passed on a short sofa without \nbedding all this kept him in a state of excite- \nment bordering on insanity. \n\nIt was two o'clock in the afternoon. The \nFrench had already entered Moscow. Pierre \nknew this, but instead of acting he only thought \nabout his undertaking, going over its minutest \ndetails in his mind. In his fancy he did not \nclearly picture to himself either the striking of \nthe blow or the death of Napoleon, but with \nextraordinary vividness and melancholy en- \njoyment imagined his own destruction and \nheroic endurance. \n\n"Yes, alone, for the sake of all, I must do it \nor perish I" he thought. "Yes, I will approach \n. . . and then suddenly . . . with pistol or dag- \nger? But that is all the same! 'It is not I but \nthe hand of Providence that punishes thee,' I \nshall say," thought he, imagining what he would \nsay when killing Napoleon. "Well then, take \nme and execute me!" he went on, speaking to \nhimself and bowing his head with a sad but \nfirm expression. \n\nWhile Pierre, standing in the middle of the \nroom, was talking to himself in this way, the \nstudy door opened and on the threshold ap- \npeared the figure of Makar Alexevich, always \nso timid before but now quite transformed. \n\nHis dressing gown was unfastened, his face \nred and distorted. He was obviously drunk. On \nseeing Pierre he grew confused at first, but \nnoticing embarrassment on Pierre's face im- \nmediately grew bold and, staggering on his \nthin legs, advanced into the middle of the \nroom. \n\n"They're frightened," he said confidentially \nin a hoarse voice. "I say I won't surrender, I \nsay . . . Am I not right, sir?" \n\nHe paused and then suddenly seeing the \npistol on the table seized it with unexpected \nrapidity and ran out into the corridor. \n\nGerdsim and the porter, who had followed \nMakar Alexevich, stopped him in the vesti- \nbule and tried to take the pistol from him. \nPierre, coming out into the corridor, looked \nwith pity and repulsion at the half-crazy old \nman. Makar Alexdevich, frowning with exer- \ntion, held on to the pistol and screamed hoarse- \nly, evidently with some heroic fancy in his \nhead. \n\n"To arms! Board them! No, you shan't get \nit," he yelled. \n\n"That will do, please, that will do. Have the \ngoodness please, sir, to let go! Please, sir . . ." \npleaded Geraim, trying carefully to steer Ma- \nkar Alexevich by the elbows back to the door. \n\n\n\n5*5 \nshouted \n\n\n\n"Who are you? Bonaparte! . \nMakar Alexevich. \n\n"That's not right, sir. Come to your room, \nplease, and rest. Allow me to have the pistol." \n\n"Be off, thou base slave! Touch me not! See \nthis?" shouted Makar Alex^evich, brandish- \ning the pistol. "Board them!" \n\n"Catch hold!" whispered Gerdsim to the \nporter. \n\nThey seized Makar Alex^evich by the arms \nand dragged him to the door. \n\nThe vestibule was filled with the discordant \nsounds of a struggle and of a tipsy, hoarse \nvoice. \n\nSuddenly a fresh sound, a piercing feminine \nscream, reverberated from the porch and the \ncook came running into the vestibule. \n\n"It's them! Gracious heavens! O Lord, four \nof them, horsemen!" she cried. \n\nGerdsim and the porter let Makar Alexe*- \nevich go, and in the now silent corridor the \nsound of several hands knocking at the front \ndoor could be heard. \n\nCHAPTER XXVIII \n\nPIERRE, having decided that until he had car- \nried out his design he would disclose neither \nhis identity nor his knowledge of French, stood \nat the half-open door of the corridor, intend- \ning to conceal himself as soon as the French \nentered. But the French entered and still Pierre \ndid not retire an irresistible curiosity kept \nhim there. \n\nThere were two of them. One was an officer \na tall, soldierly, handsome man the other \nevidently a private or an orderly, sunburned, \nshort, and thin, with sunken cheeks and a dull \nexpression. The officer walked in front, lean- \ning on a stick and slightly limping. When he \nhad advanced a few steps he stopped, having \napparently decided that these were good quar- \nters, turned round to the soldiers standing at \nthe entrance, and in a loud voice of command \nordered them to put up the horses. Having \ndone that, the officer, lifting his elbow with a \nsmart gesture, stroked hjs mustache and light- \nly touched his hat. \n\n"Bon/our, la compagnie!"* said he gaily, \nsmiling and looking about him. \n\nNo one gave any reply. \n\n"Vous ties le bourgeois!" * the officer asked \nGerasim. \n\nGerdsim gazed at the officer with an alarmed \nand inquiring look. \n\n1 "Good day, everybody!" \n1 "Are you the master nere?" \n\n\n\nWAR ANi&gt; PEACE \n\n\n\n"Quartier, quartier, logement!" said the of- \nficer, looking down at the little man with a con- \ndescending and good-natured smile. "Les fran- \ncaissont de bons enfants. Que diable! Voyons! \nNe nous factions pas, mon vieux!" * added he, \nclapping the scared and silent Gerdsim on the \nshoulder. "Well, does no one speak French in \nthis establishment?" he asked again in French, \nlooking around and meeting Pierre's eyes. \nPierre moved away from the door. \n\nAgain the officer turned to Gerdsim and \nasked him to show him the rooms in the house. \n\n"Master, not here don't understand . . . me, \nyou . . ." said Gerasim, trying to render his \nwords more comprehensible by contorting \nthem. \n\nStill smiling, the French officer spread out \nhis hands before Gerasim's nose, intimating \nthat he did not understand him either, and \nmoved, limping, to the door at which Pierre \nwas standing. Pierre wished to go away and \nconceal himself, but at that moment he saw \nMakar Alexdevichappcaringat the open kitch- \nen door with the pistol in his hand. With a \nmadman's cunning, Makar Alexe"evicheyed the \nFrenchman, raised his pistol, and took aim. \n\n"Board them!" yelled the tipsy man, trying \nto press the trigger. Hearing the yell the officer \nturned round, and at the same moment Pierre \nthrew himself on the drunkard. Just when \nPierre snatched at and struck up the pistol Ma- \nkdr Alex^evich at last got his fingerson the trig- \nger, there was a deafening report, and all were \nenveloped in a cloud of smoke. The French- \nman turned pale and rushed to the door. \n\nForgetting his intention of concealing his \nknowledge of French, Pierre, snatching away \nthe pistol and throwing it down, ran up to the \nofficer and addressed him in French. \n\n"You are not wounded?" he asked. \n\n"I think not," answered the Frenchman, \nfeeling himself over. "But I have had a lucky \nescape this time," he added, pointing to the \ndamaged plaster of the wall. "Who is that man?" \nsaid he, looking sternly at Pierre. \n\n"Oh, I am really in despair at what has oc- \ncurred," said Pierre rapidly, quite forgetting \nthe part he had intended to play. "He is an un- \nfortunate madman who did not know what he \nwas doing." \n\nThe officer went up to Makdr Alex^evichand \ntook him by the collar. \n\nMakar Alexeevich was standing with parted \n\n1 "Quarters, quarters, lodgings! The French are \ngood fellows. What the devil! There, don't let us \nbe cross, old fellow!" \n\n\n\nlips, swaying, as if about to fall asleep, as he \nleaned against the wall. \n\n"Brigand! You shall pay for this," said the \nFrenchman, letting go of him. "We French are \nmerciful after victory, but we do not pardon \ntraitors," he added, with a look of gloomy dig- \nnity and a fine energetic gesture. \n\nPierre continued, in French, to persuade the \nofficer not to hold that drunken imbecile to ac- \ncount. The Frenchman listened in silence with \nthe same gloomy expression, but suddenly \nturned to Pierre with a smile. For a few sec- \nonds he looked at him in silence. His hand- \nsome face assumed a melodramatically gentle \nexpression arid he held out his hand. \n\n"You have saved my life. You are French," \nsaid he. \n\nFor a Frenchman that deduction was indu- \nbitable. Only a Frenchman could perform a \ngreat deed, and to save his life the life of M. \nRamballc, captain of the igth Light Regiment \nwas undoubtedly a very great deed. \n\nBut however indubitable that conclusion and \nthe officer's conviction based upon it, Pierre \nfelt it necessary to disillusion him. \n\n"I am Russian," he said quickly. \n\n"Tut, tut, tut! Tell that to others," said the \nofficer, waving his finger before his nose and \nsmiling. "You shall tell me all about that pres- \nently. I am delighted to meet a compatriot. \nWell, and what are we to do with this man?" \nhe added, addressing himself to Pierre as to a \nbrother. \n\nEven if Pierre were not a Frenchman, hav- \ning once received that loftiest of human appel- \nlations he could not renounce it, said the offi- \ncer's look and tone. In reply to his last question \nPierre again explained who Makar Alexeevich \nwas and how just before their arrival that \ndrunken imbecile had seized the loaded pistol \nwhich they had not had time to recover from \nhim, and begged the officer to let the deed go \nunpunished. \n\nThe Frenchman expanded his chest and \nmade a majestic gesture with his arm. \n\n"You have saved my life! You are French. \nYou ask his pardon? I grant it you. Lead that \nman away!" said he quickly and energetically, \nand taking the arm of Pierre whom he had \npromoted to be a Frenchman for saving his \nlife, he went with him into the room. \n\nThe soldiers in the yard, hearing the shot, \ncame into the passage asking what had hap- \npened, and expressed their readiness to punish \nthe culprits, but the officer sternly checked \nthem. \n\n\n\nBOOK ELEVEN \n\n\n\n"You will be called in when you are wanted," \nhe said. \n\nThe soldiers went out again, and the order- \nly, who had meanwhile had time to visit the \nkitchen, came up to his officer. \n\n"Captain, there is soup and a leg of mutton \nin the kitchen," said he. "Shall I serve them \nup?" \n\n"Yes, and some wine," answered the cap- \ntain. \n\nCHAPTER XXIX \n\nWHEN THE FRENCH OFFICER went into the room \nwith Pierre the latter again thought it his duty \nto assure him that he was not French and \nwished to go away, but the officer would not \nhear of it. He was so very polite, amiable, good- \nnatured, and genuinely grateful to Pierre for \nsaving his life that Pierre had not the heart to \nrefuse, and sat down with him in the parlor \nthe first room they entered. To Pierre's as- \nsurances that he was not a Frenchman, the \ncaptain, evidently not understanding how any- \none could decline so flattering an appellation, \nshrugged his shoulders and said that if Pierre \nabsolutely insisted on passing for a Russian \nlet it be so, but for all that he would be for- \never bound to Pierre by gratitude for saving \nhis life. \n\nHad this man been endowed with the slight- \nest capacity for perceiving the feelings of oth- \ners, and had he at all understood what Pierre's \nfeelings were, the latter would probably have \nleft him, but the man's animated obtuseness \nto everything other than himself disarmed \nPierre. \n\n"A Frenchman or a Russian prince incog- \nnito," said the officer, looking at Pierre's fine \nthough dirty linen and at the ring on his fin- \nger. "I owe my life to you and offer you my \nfriendship. A Frenchman never forgets either \nan insult or a service. I offer you my friendship. \nThat is all I can say." \n\nThere was so much good nature and nobility \n(in the French sense of the word) in the officer's \nvoice, in the expression of his face and in his \ngestures, that Pierre, unconsciously smiling in \nresponse to the Frenchman's smile, pressed the \nhand held out to him. \n\n"Captain Ramballe, of the 131!! Light Reg- \niment, Chevalier of the Legion of Honor for \nthe affair on the seventh of September," he in- \ntroduced himself, a self-satisfied irrepressible \nsmile puckering his lips under his mustache. \n"Will you now be so good as to tell me with \nwhom I have the honor of conversing so pleas- \n\n\n\nantly, instead of being in the ambulance with \nthat maniac's bullet in my body?" \n\nPierre replied that he could not tell him \nhis name and, blushing, began to try to invent \na name and to say something about his reason \nfor concealing it, but the Frenchman hastily \ninterrupted him. \n\n"Oh, please!" said he. "I understand your \nreasons. You are an officer ... a superior officer \nperhaps. You have borne arms against us. \nThat's not my business. I owe you my life. \nThat is enough for me. I am quite at your serv- \nice. You belong to the gentry?" he concluded \nwith a shade of inquiry in his tone. Pierre bent \nhis head. "Your baptismal name, if you please. \nThat is all I ask. Monsieur Pierre, you say. . . . \nExcellent! That's all I want to know." \n\nWhen the mutton and an omelet had been \nserved and a samovar and vodka brought, with \nsome wine which the French had taken from \na Russian cellar and brought with them, Ram- \nballe invited Pierre to share his dinner, and \nhimself began to eat greedily and quickly like \na healthy and hungry man, munching his food \nrapidly with his strong teeth, continually \nsmacking his lips, and repeating "Excellent! \nDelicious!" His face grew red and was covered \nwith perspiration. Pierre was hungry and \nshared the dinner with pleasure. Morel, the \norderly, brought some hot water in a saucepan \nand placed a bottle of claret in it. He also \nbrought a bottle of kvass, taken from the kitch- \nen for them to try. That beverage was already \nknown to the French and had been given a \nspecial name. They called it limonade de co- \nchon (pig's lemonade), and Morel spoke well \nof the limonade de cochon he had found in the \nkitchen. But as the captain had the wine they \nhad taken while passing through Moscow, he \nleft the kvass to Morel and applied himself to \nthe bottle of Bordeaux. He wrapped the bot- \ntle up to its neck in a table napkin and poured \nout wine for himself and for Pierre. The satis- \nfaction of his hunger and the wine rendered \nthe captain still more lively and he chatted in- \ncessantly all through dinner. \n\n"Yes, my dear Monsieur Pierre, I owe you a \nfine votive candle for saving me from that \nmaniac. . . . You see, I have bullets enough in \nmy body already. Here is one I got at Wagram" \n(he touched his side) "and a second at Smo- \ntensk" he showed a scar on his cheek "and \nthis leg which as you see does not want to \nmarch, I got that on the seventh at the great \nbattle of la Moskowa. Sacrd Dieu! It was splen- \ndid! That deluge of fire was worth seeing. It \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nwas a tough job you set us there, my word! \nYou may be proud of it! And on my honor, in \nspite of the cough I caught there, I should be \nready to begin again. I pity those who did not \nsee it." \n\n"I was there," said Pierre. \n\n"Bah, really? So much the betterl You are \ncertainly brave foes. The great redoubt held \nout well, by my pipe!" continued the French- \nman. "And you made us pay dear for it. I was \nat it three times sure as I sit here. Three \ntimes we reached the guns and three times we \nwere thrown back like cardboard figures. Oh, it \nwas beautiful, Monsieur Pierre! Your grena- \ndiers were splendid, by heaven! I saw them \nclose up their ranks six times in succession and \nmarch as if on parade. Fine fellows! Our King \nof Naples, who knows what's what, cried \n'Bravo!' Ha, ha! So you are one of us soldiers!" \nhe added, smiling, after a momentary pause. \n"So much the better, so much the better, Mon- \nsieur Pierre! Terrible in battle . . . gallant . . . \nwith the fair" (he winked and smiled), "that's \nwhat the French are, Monsieur Pierre, aren't \nthey?" \n\nThe captain was so naively and good-humor- \nedly gay, so real, and so pleased with himself \nthat Pierre almost winked back as he looked \nmerrily at him. Probably the word "gallant" \nturned the captain's thoughts to the state of \nMoscow. \n\n"Apropos, tell me please, is it true that the \nwomen have all left Moscow? What a queer \nidea! What had they to be afraid of?" \n\n"Would not the French ladies leave Paris if \nthe Russians entered it?" asked Pierre. \n\n"Ha, ha, ha!" The Frenchman emitted a \nmerry, sanguine chuckle, patting Pierre on the \nshoulder. "What a thing to say!" he exclaimed. \n"Paris? . . . But Paris, Paris . . ." \n\n"Paris the capital of the world," Pierre fin- \nished his remark for him. \n\nThe captain looked at Pierre. He had a hab- \nit of stoppingshort in the middle of his talk and \ngazing intently with his laughing, kindly eyes. \n\n"Well, if you hadn't told me you were Rus- \nsian, I should have wagered that you were \nParisian! You have that ... I don't know what, \nthat . . ." and having uttered this compliment, \nhe again gazed at him in silence. \n\n"I have been in Paris. I spent years there," \nsaid Pierre. \n\n"Oh yes, one sees that plainly. Paris! ... A \nman who doesn't know Paris is a savage. You \ncan tell a Parisian two leagues off. Paris is Tal- \nma, la Duch^nois, Potier, the Sorbonne, the \n\n\n\nboulevards," x and noticing that his conclusion \nwas weaker than what had gone before, he add- \ned quickly: "There is only one Paris in the \nworld. You have been to Paris and have re- \nmained Russian. Well, I don't esteem you the \nless for it." \n\nUnder the influence of the wine he had \ndrunk, and after the days he had spent alone \nwith his depressing thoughts, Pierre involun- \ntarily enjoyed talking with this cheerful and \ngood-natured man. \n\n"To return to your ladies I hear they are \nlovely. What a wretched idea to go and bury \nthemselves in the steppes when the French ar- \nmy is in Moscow. What a chance those girls \nhave missed! Your peasants, now that's an- \nother thing; but you civilized people, you \nought to know us better than that. We took \nVienna, Berlin, Madrid, Naples, Rome, War- \nsaw, all the world's capitals. . . . We are feared, \nbut we are loved. We are nice to know. And \nthen the Emperor . . ." he began, but Pierre \ninterrupted him. \n\n"The Emperor," Pierre repeated, and his \nface suddenly became sad and embarrassed, \n"is the Emperor . . .?" \n\n"The Emperor? He is generosity, mercy, jus- \ntice, order, genius that's what the Emperor \nis! It is I, Ramballe, who tell you so. ... I assure \nyou I was his enemy eight years ago. My fa- \nther was an emigrant count. . . . But that man \nhas vanquished me. He has taken hold of me. \nI could not resist the sight of the grandeur and \nglory with which he has covered France. When \nI understood what he wanted when I saw \nthat he was preparing a bed of laurels for us, \nyou know, I said to myself: 'That is a monarch/ \nand I devoted myself to him! So there! Oh yes, \nmon cher, he is the greatest man of the ages \npast or future." \n\n"Is he in Moscow?" Pierre stammered with a \nguilty look. \n\nThe Frenchman looked at his guilty face \nand smiled. \n\n"No, he will make his entry tomorrow," he \nreplied, and continued his talk. \n\nTheir conversation was interrupted by the \ncries of several voices at the gate and by Morel, \nwho came to say that some Wurttemberg hus- \nsars had come and wanted to put up their \nhorses in the yard where the captain's horses \nwere. This difficulty had arisen chiefly because \nthe hussars did not understand what was said \nto them in French. \n\n1 The famous tragedian Talma, the actress Du- \nche'nois, the comedian Potier. TR. \n\n\n\nThe captain had their senior sergeant called \nin, and in a stern voice asked him to what reg- \niment he belonged, who was his commanding \nofficer, and by what right he allowed himself \nto claim quarters that were already occupied. \nThe German who knew little French, answered \nthe two first questions by giving the names of \nhis regiment and of his commanding officer, \nbut in reply to the third question which he did \nnot understand said, introducing broken \nFrench into his own German, that he was the \nquartermaster of the regiment and his com- \nmander had ordered him to occupy all the \nhouses one after another. Pierre, who knew \nGerman, translated what the German said to \nthe captain and gave the captain's reply to the \nWurttemberg hussar in German. When he had \nunderstood what was said to him, the German \nsubmitted and took his men elsewhere. The \ncaptain went out into the porch and gave some \norders in a loud voice. \n\nWhen he returned to the room Pierre was \nsitting in the same place as before, with his \nhead in his hands. His face expressed suffering. \nHe really was suffering at that moment. When \nthe captain went out and he was left alone, \nsuddenly he came to himself and realized the po- \nsition he was in. It was not that Moscow had \nbeen taken or that the happy conquerors were \nmasters in it and were patronizing him. Painful \nas that was it was not that which tormented \nPierre at the moment. He was tormented by the \nconsciousness of his own weakness. The few \nglasses of wine he had drunk and the conversa- \ntion with this good-natured man had destroyed \nthe mood of concentrated gloom in which he \nhad spent the last few days and which was es- \nsential for the execution of his design. The pis- \ntol, dagger, and peasant coat were ready. Napo- \nleon was to enter the town next day. Pierre still \nconsidered that it would be a useful and worthy \naction to slay the evildoer, but now he felt that \nhe would not do it. He did not know why, but \nhe felt a foreboding that he would not carry \nout his intention. He struggled against the con- \nfession of his weakness but dimly felt that he \ncould not overcome it and that his former \ngloomy frame of mind, concerning vengeance, \nkilling, and self-sacrifice, had been dispersed \nlike dust by contact with the first man he \nmet. \n\nThe captain returned to the room, limping \nslightly and whistling a tune. \n\nThe Frenchman's chatter which had previ- \nously amused Pierre now repelled him. The \ntune he was whistling, his gait, and the gesture \n\n\n\nBOOK ELEVEN 519 \n\nwith which he twirled his mustache, all now \nseemed offensive. "I will go away immediately. \nI won't say another word to him," thought \nPierre. He thought this, but still sat in the \nsame place. A strange feeling of weakness tied \nhim to the spot; he wished to get up and go \naway, but could not do so. \n\nThe captain, on the other hand, seemed \nvery cheerful. He paced up and down the room \ntwice. His eyes shone and his mustache twitched \nas if he were smiling to himself at some amus- \ning thought. \n\n"The colonel of those Wurttembergers is de- \nlightful," he suddenly said. "He's a German, \nbut a nice fellow all the same. . . . But he's a \nGerman." He sat down facing Pierre. "By the \nway, you know German, then?" \n\nPierre looked at him in silence. \n\n"What is the German for 'shelter'?" \n\n"Shelter?" Pierre repeated. "The German \nfor shelter is Unterkunjt." \n\n"How do you say it?" the captain asked \nquickly and doubtfully. \n\n"Unterkunft," Pierre repeated. \n\n"Onterkoff," said the captain and looked at \nPierre for some seconds with laughing eyes. \n"These Germans are first-rate fools, don't you \nthink so, Monsieur Pierre?" he concluded. \n\n"Well, let's have another bottle of this Mos- \ncow Bordeaux, shall we? Morel will warm us \nup another little bottle. Morel!" he called out \ngaily. \n\nMorel brought candles and a bottle of wine. \nThe captain looked at Pierre by the candle- \nlight and was evidently struck by the troubled \nexpression on his companion's face. Ramballe, \nwith genuine distress and sympathy in his face, \nwent up to Pierre and bent over him. \n\n"There now, we're sad," said he, touching \nPierre's hand. "Have I upset you? No, really, \nhave you anything against me?" he asked \nPierre. "Perhaps it's the state of affairs?" \n\nPierre did not answer, but looked cordially \ninto the Frenchman's eyes whose expression of \nsympathy was pleasing to him. \n\n"Honestly, without speaking of what I owe \nyou, I feel friendship for you. Can I do any- \nthing for you? Dispose of me. It is for life and \ndeath. I say it with my hand on my heart!" said \nhe, striking his chest. \n\n"Thank you," said Pierre. \n\nThe captain gazed intently at him as he \nhad done when he learned that "shelter" was \nUnterkunft in German, and his face suddenly \nbrightened. \n\n"Well, in that case, I drink to our friend- \n\n\n\n5*0 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nship!" he cried gaily, filling two glasses with \nwine. \n\nPierre took one of the glasses and emptied it. \nRamballe emptied his too, again pressed \nPierre's hand, and leaned his elbows on the \ntable in a pensive attitude. \n\n"Yes, my dear friend," he began, "such is \nfortune's caprice. Who would have said that I \nshould be a soldier and a captain of dragoons \nin the service of Bonaparte, as we used to call \nhim? Yet here I am in Moscow with him. I \nmust tell you, mon cher" he continued in the \nsad and measured tones of a man who intends \nto tell a long story, "that our name is one of \nthe most ancient in France." \n\nAnd with a Frenchman's easy and naive \nfrankness the captain told Pierre the story of \nhis ancestors, his childhood, youth, and man- \nhood, and all about his relations and his finan- \ncial and family affairs, "ma pauvre mtre" play- \ning of course an important part in the story. \n\n"But all that is only life's setting, the real \nthing is love love! Am I not right, Monsieur \nPierre?" said he, growing animated. "Another \nglass?" \n\nPierre again emptied his glass and poured \nhimself out a third. \n\n"Oh, women, women!" and the captain, \nlooking with glistening eyes at Pierre, began \ntalking of love and of his love affairs. \n\nThere were very many of these, as one could \neasily believe, looking at the officer's hand- \nsome, self-satisfied face, and noting the eager \nenthusiasm with which he spoke of women. \nThough all Ramballe's love stories had the \nsensual character which Frenchmen regard as \nthe special charm and poetry of love, yet he \ntold his story with such sincere conviction that \nhe alone had experienced and known all the \ncharm of love and he described women so al- \nluringly that Pierre listened to him with curi- \nosity. \n\nIt was plain that I' amour which the French- \nman was so fond of was not that low and simple \nkind that Pierre had once felt for his wife, nor \nwas it the romantic love stimulated by himself \nthat he experienced for Natasha. (Ramballe de- \nspised both these kinds of love equally: the one \nhe considered the "love of clodhoppers" and \nthe other the "love of simpletons.") L 'amour \nwhich the Frenchman worshiped consisted \nprincipally in the unnaturalness of his relation \nto the woman and in a combination of incon- \ngruities giving the chief charm to the feeling. \n\nThus the captain touchingly recounted the \nstory of his love for a fascinating marquise of \n\n\n\nthirty-five and at the same time for a charm- \ning, innocent child of seventeen, daughter of \nthe bewitching marquise. The conflict of mag- \nnanimity between the mother and the daugh- \nter, ending in the mother's sacrificing herself \nand offering her daughter in marriage to her \nlover, even now agitated the captain, though it \nwas the memory of a distant past. Then he re- \ncounted an episode in which the husband \nplayed the part of the lover, and he the lover \nassumed the role of the husband, as well as \nseveral droll incidents from his recollections of \nGermany, where "shelter" is called Unterkunft, \nand where the husbands eat sauerkraut and the \nyoung girls are "too blonde." \n\nFinally, the latest episode in Poland still \nfresh in the captain's memory, and which he \nnarrated with rapid gestures and glowing face, \nwas of how he had saved the life of a Pole (in \ngeneral, the saving of life continually occurred \nin the captain's stories) and the Pole had en- \ntrusted to him his enchanting wife (parisienne \nde cceur) while himself entering the French \nservice. The captain was happy, the enchant- \ning Polish lady wished to elope with him, but, \nprompted by magnanimity, the captain re- \nstored the wife to the husband, saying as he did \nso: "I have saved your life, and I save your \nhonor!" Having repeated these words the cap- \ntain wiped his eyes and gave himself a shake, \nas if driving away the weakness which assailed \nhim at this touching recollection. \n\nListening to the captain's tales, Pierre as \noften happens late in the evening and under \nthe influence of wine followed all that was \ntold him, understood it all, and at the same \ntime followed a train of personal memories \nwhich, he knew not why, suddenly arose in his \nmind. While listening to these love stories his \nown love for Natasha unexpectedly rose to his \nmind, and going over the pictures of that love \nin his imagination he mentally compared \nthem with Ramballe's tales. Listening to the \nstory of the struggle between love and duty, \nPierre saw before his eyes every minutest de- \ntail of his last meeting with the object of his \nlove at the Sukharev water tower. At the time \nof that meeting it had not produced an effect \nupon him he had not even once recalled it. But \nnow itseemed to him that that meeting had had \nin it something very important and poetic. \n\n"Peter Kirflovich, come herel We have rec- \nognized you," he now seemed to hear the words \nshe had uttered and to see before him her \neyes, her smile, her traveling hood, and a stray \nlock of her hair . . . and there seemed to him \n\n\n\nBOOK ELEVEN \n\n\n\nsomething pathetic and touching in all this. \n\nHaving finished his tale about the enchant- \ning Polish lady, the captain asked Pierre if \nhe had ever experienced a similar impulse to \nsacrifice himself for love and a feeling of envy \nof the legitimate husband. \n\nChallenged by this question Pierre raised his \nhead and felt a need to express the thoughts \nthat filled his mind. He began to explain that \nhe understood love for a women somewhat \ndifferently. He said that in all his life he had \nloved and still loved only one woman, and that \nshe could never be his. \n\n"Tiens!" said the captain. \n\nPierre then explained that he had loved this \nwoman from his earliest years, but that he had \nnot dared to think of her because she was too \nyoung, and because he had been an illegitimate \nson without a name. Afterwards when he had \nreceived a name and wealth he dared not think \nof her because he loved her too well, placing \nher far above everything in the world, and es- \npecially therefore above himself. \n\nWhen he had reached this point, Pierre asked \nthe captain whether he understood that. \n\nThe captain made a gesture signifying that \neven if he did not understand it he begged \nPierre to continue. \n\n"Platonic love, clouds . . ." he muttered. \n\nWhether it was the wine he had drunk, or \nan impulse of frankness, or the thought that \nthis man did not, and never would, know any \nof those who played a part in his story, or \nwhether it was all these things together, some- \nthing loosened Pierre's tongue. Speaking thick- \nly and with a faraway look in his shining eyes, \nhe told the whole story of his life: his marriage, \nNatasha's love for his best friend, her betrayal \nof him, and all his own simple relations with \nher. Urged on oy Ramballe's questions he also \ntold what he had at first concealed his own po- \nsition and even his name. \n\nMore than anything else in Pierre's story the \ncaptain was impressed by the fact that Pierre \nwas very rich, had two mansions in Moscow, \nand that he had abandoned everything and \nnot left the city, but remained there conceal- \ning his name and station. \n\nWhen it was late at night they went out to- \ngether into the street. The night was warm and \nlight. To the left of the house on the Pokr6vka \na fire glowed the first of those that were be- \nginning in Moscow. To the right and high up \nin the sky was the sickle of the waning moon \nand opposite to it hung that bright comet \nwhich was connected in Pierre's heart with his \n\n\n\nlove. At the gate stood Gerdsim, the cook, and \ntwo Frenchmen. Their laughter and their mu- \ntually incomprehensible remarks in two lan- \nguages could be heard. They were looking at \nthe glow seen in the town. \n\nThere was nothing terrible in the one small, \ndistant fire in the immense city. \n\nGazing at the high starry sky, at the moon, \nat the comet, and at the glow from the fire, \nPierre experienced a joyful emotion. "There \nnow, how good it is, what more does one need?" \nthought he. And suddenly remembering his \nintention he grew dizzy and felt so faint that \nhe leaned against the fence to save himself \nfrom falling. \n\nWithout taking leave of his new friend. \nPierre left the gate with unsteady steps and re- \nturning to his room lay down on the sofa and \nimmediately fell asleep. \n\nCHAPTER XXX \n\nTHE GLOW of the first fire that began on the \nsecond of September was watched from the \nvarious roads by the fugitive Muscovites and \nby the retreating troops, with many different \nfeelings. \n\nThe Rostov party spent the night at Mytish- \nchi, fourteen miles from Moscow. They had \nstarted so late on the first of September, the \nroad had been so blocked by vehicles a nd troops, \nso many things had been forgotten for which \nservants were sent back, that they had decided \nto spend that night at a place three miles out \nof Moscow. The next morning they woke late \nand were again delayed so often that they only \ngot as far as Great Mytfshchi. At ten o'clock \nthat evening the Rost6v family and the wound- \ned traveling with them were all distributed in \nthe yards and huts of that large village. The \nRostovs' servants and coachmen and the or- \nderlies of the wounded officers, after attending \nto their masters, had supper, fed the horses, \nand came out into the porches. \n\nIn a neighboring hut lay Rac" vski's adjutant \nwith a fractured wrist. The awful pain he suf- \nfered made him moan incessantly and piteous- \nly, and his moaning sounded terrible in the \ndarkness of the autumn night. He had spent \nthe first night in the same yard as the Rostovs. \nThe countess said she had been unable to close \nher eyes on account of his moaning, and at \nMystfshchi she moved into a worse hut simply \nto be farther away from the wounded man. \n\nIn the darkness of the night one of the serv- \nants noticed, above the high body of a coach \nstanding before the porch, the small glow of \n\n\n\n5** \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nanother fire. One glow had long been visible \nand everybody knew that it was Little Mytish- \nchi burning set on fire by Mam6nov's Cos- \nsacks. \n\n"But look here, brothers, there's another \nfire!" remarked an orderly. \n\nAll turned their attention to the glow. \n\n"But they told us Little Mytishchi had been \nset on fire by Mam6nov's Cossacks." \n\n"But that's not Mytishchi, it's farther away." \n\n"Look, it must be in Moscow!" \n\nTwo of the gazers went round to the other \nside of the coach and sat down on its steps. \n\n"It's more to the left, why, Little Mytishchi \nis over there, and this is right on the other \nside." \n\nSeveral men joined the first two. \n\n"See how it's flaring," said one. "That's a \nfire in Moscow: either in the Sushchvski or \nthe Rog6zhski quarter." \n\nNo one replied to this remark and for some \ntime they all gazed silently at the spreading \nflames of the second fire in the distance. \n\nOld Daniel Ter^ntich, the count's valet (as \nhe was called), came up to the group and shout- \ned at Mishka. \n\n"What are you staring at, you good-for-noth- \ning? . . . The count will be calling and there's \nnobody there; go and gather the clothes to- \ngether." \n\n"I only ran out to get some water," said \nMishka. \n\n"But what do you think, Daniel Ter^ntich? \nDoesn't it look as if that glow were in Mos- \ncow?" remarked one of the footmen. \n\nDaniel Ter^ntich made no reply, and again \nfor a long time they were all silent. The glow \nspread, rising and falling, farther and farther \nstill. \n\n"God have mercy. . . . It's windy and dry \n. . ." said another voice. \n\n"Just look! See what it's doing now. O Lord! \nYou can even see the crows flying. Lord have \nmercy on us sinners!" \n\n"They'll put it out, no fear!" \n\n"Who's to put it out?" Daniel Ter^ntich, \nwho had hitherto been silent, was heard to say. \nHis voice was calm and deliberate. "Moscow it \nis, brothers," said he. "Mother Moscow, the \nwhite . . ." his voice faltered, and he gave way \nto an old man's sob. \n\nAnd it was as if they had all only waited for \nthis to realize the significance for them of the \nglow they were watching. Sighs were heard, \nwords of prayer, and the sobbing of the count's \nold valet. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI \n\nTHE VALET, returning to the cottage, informed \nthe count that Moscow was burning. The count \ndonned his dressing gown and went out to \nlook. S6nya and Madame Schoss, who had not \nyet undressed, went out with him. Only Nata- \nsha and the countess remained in the room. \nPtya was no longer with the family, he had \ngone on with his regiment which was making \nfor Tr6itsa. \n\nThe countess, on hearing that Moscow was \non fire, began to cry. Natdsha, pale, with a \nfixed look, was sitting on the bench under the \nicons just where she had sat down on arriving \nand paid no attention to her father's words. \nShe was listening to the ceaseless moaning of \nthe adjutant, three houses off. \n\n"Oh, how terrible," said S6nya, returning \nfrom the yard chilled and frightened. "I be- \nlieve the whole of Moscow will burn, there's an \nawful glow! Natdsha, do look! You can see it \nfrom the window," she said to her cousin, evi- \ndently wishing to distract her mind. \n\nBut Natdsha looked at her as if not under- \nstanding what was said to her and again fixed \nher eyes on the corner of the stove. She had \nbeen in this condition of stupor since the morn- \ning, when S6nya, to the surprise and annoy- \nance of the countess, had for some unaccount- \nable reason found it necessary to tell Natdsha \nof Prince Andrew's wound and of his being \nwith their party. The countess had seldom \nbeen so angry with anyone as she was with \nS6nya. S6nya had cried and begged to be for- \ngiven and now, as if trying to atone for her \nfault, paid unceasing attention to her cousin. \n\n"Look, Natdsha, how dreadfully it is burn- \ning! "said she. \n\n"What's burning?" asked Natdsha. "Oh, yes, \nMoscow." \n\nAnd as if in order not to offend S6nya and \nto get rid of her, she turned her face to the \nwindow, looked out in such a way that it was \nevident that she could not see anything, and \nagain settled down in her former attitude. \n\n"But you didn't see it!" \n\n"Yes, really I did," Natdsha replied in a \nvoice that pleaded to be left in peace. \n\nBoth the countess and S6nya understood \nthat, naturally, neither Moscow nor the burn- \ning of Moscow nor anything else could seem of \nimportance to Natdsha. \n\nThe count returned and lay down behind \nthe partition. The countess went up to her \ndaughter and touched her head with the back \nof her hand as she was wont to do when Natd- \n\n\n\nBOOK ELEVEN \n\n\n\n5*3 \n\n\n\nsha was ill, then touched her forehead with her \nlips as if to feel whether she was feverish, and \nfinally kissed her. \n\n"You are cold. You are trembling all over. \nYou'd better lie down," said the countess. \n\n"Lie down? All right, I will. I'll lie down at \nonce," said Natasha. \n\nWhen Natdsha had been told that morning \nthat Prince Andrew was seriously wounded \nand was traveling with their party, she had at \nfirst asked many questions: Where was he go- \ning? How was he wounded? Was it serious? And \ncould she see him? But after she had been told \nthat she could not see him, that he was serious- \nly wounded but that his life was not in danger, \nshe ceased to ask questions or to speak at all, \nevidently disbelieving what they told her, and \nconvinced that say what she might she would \nstill be told the same. All the way she had sat \nmotionless in a corner of the coach with wide- \nopen eyes, and the expression in them which \nthe countess knew so well and feared so much, \nand now she sat in the same way on the bench \nwhere she had seated herself on arriving. She \nwas planning something and either deciding \nor had already decided something in her mind. \nThe countess knew this, but what it might be \nshe did not know, and this alarmed and tor- \nmented her. \n\n"Natdsha, undress, darling; lie down on my \nbed." \n\nA bed had been made on a bedstead for the \ncountess only. Madame Schoss and the two girls \nwere to sleep on some hay on the floor. \n\n"No, Mamma, I will lie down here on the \nfloor," Natasha replied irritably and she went \nto the window and opened it. Through the \nopen window the moans of the adjutant could \nbe heard more distinctly. She put her head out \ninto the damp night air, and the countess saw \nher slim neck shaking with sobs and throbbing \nagainst the window frame. Natdsha knew it \nwas not Prince Andrew who was moaning. She \nknew Prince Andrew was in the same yard as \nthemselves and in a part of the hut across the \npassage; but this dreadful incessant moaning \nmade her sob. The countess exchanged a look \nwith S6nya. \n\n"Lie down, darling; lie down, my pet," said \nthe countess, softly touching Natasha's shoul- \nders. "Come, lie down." \n\n"Oh, yes ... I'll lie down at once," said Na- \ntdsha, and began hurriedly undressing, tugging \nat the tapes of her petticoat. \n\nWhen she had thrown off her dress and put \non a dressing jacket, she sat down with her \n\n\n\nfoot under her on the bed that had been made \nup on the floor, jerked her thin and rather \nshort plait of hair to the front, and began re- \nplaiting it. Her long, thin, practiced fingers \nrapidly unplaited, replaited, and tied up her \nplait. Her head moved from side to side from \nhabit, but her eyes, feverishly wide, looked \nfixedly before her. When her toilet for the \nnight was finished she sank gently onto the \nsheet spread over the hay on the side nearest \nthe door. \n\n"Natdsha, you'd better lie in the middle," \nsaid S6nya. \n\n"I'll stay here," muttered Natdsha. "Do lie \ndown," she added crossly, and buried her face \nin the pillow. \n\nThe countess, Madame Schoss, and S6nya \nundressed hastily and lay down. The small \nlamp in front of the icons was the only light \nleft in the room. But in the yard there was a \nlight from the fire at Little Mytishchi a mile \nand a half away, and through the night came \nthe noise of people shouting at a tavern Ma- \nm6nov's Cossacks had set up across the street, \nand the adjutant's unceasing moans could still \nbe heard. \n\nFor a long time Natdsha listened attentively \nto the sounds that reached her from inside and \noutside the room and did not move. First she \nheard her mother praying and sighing and the \ncreaking of her bed under her, then Madame \nSchoss 1 familiar whistling snore and S6nya's \ngentle breathing. Then the countess called to \nNatdsha. Natdsha did not answer. \n\n"I think she's asleep, Mamma," said S6nya \nsoftly. \n\nAfter a short silence the countess spoke again \nbut this time no one replied. \n\nSoon after that Natdsha heard her mother's \neven breathing. Natdsha did not move, though \nher little bare foot, thrust out from under the \nquilt, was growing cold on the bare floor. \n\nAs if to celebrate a victory over everybody, \na cricket chirped in a crack in the wall. A cock \ncrowed far off and another replied near by. \nThe shouting in the tavern had died down; \nonly the moaning of the adjutant was heard. \nNatdsha sat up. \n\n"S6nya, are you asleep? Mamma?" she whis- \npered. \n\nNo one replied. Natdsha rose slowly and care- \nfully, crossed herself, and stepped cautiously \non the cold and dirty floor with her slim, sup- \nple, bare feet. The boards of the floor creaked. \nStepping cautiously from one foot to the other \nshe ran like a kitten the few steps to the door \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nand grasped the cold door handle. \n\nIt seemed to her that something heavy was \nbeating rhythmically against all the walls of \nthe room: it was her own heart, sinking with \nalarm and terror and overflowing with love. \n\nShe opened the door and stepped across the \nthreshold and onto the cold, damp earthen \nfloor of the passage. The cold she felt refreshed \nher. With her bare feet she touched a sleeping \nman, stepped over him, and opened the door \ninto the part of the hut where Prince Andrew \nlay. It was dark in there. In the farthest corner, \non a bench beside a bed on which something \nwas lying, stood a tallow candle with a long, \nthick, and smoldering wick. \n\nFrom the moment she had been told that \nmorning of Prince Andrew's wound and his \npresence there, Natasha had resolved to see \nhim. She did not know why she had to, she \nknew the meeting would be painful, but felt \nthe more convinced that it was necessary. \n\nAll day she had lived only in hope of seeing \nhim that night. But now that the moment had \ncome she was filled with dread of what she \nmight see. How was he maimed? What was left \nof him? Was he like that incessant moaning of \nthe adjutant's? Yes, he was altogether like that. \nIn her imagination he was that terrible moan- \ning personified. When she saw an indistinct \nshape in the corner, and mistook his knees \nraised under the quilt for his shoulders, she \nimagined a horrible body there, and stood still \nin terror. But an irresistible impulse drew her \nforward. She cautiously took one step and then \nanother, and found herself in the middle of a \nsmall room containing baggage. Another man \nTim6khin was lying in a corner on the \nbenches beneath the icons, and two others \nthe doctor and a valet lay on the floor. \n\nThe valet sat up and whispered something. \nTim6khin, kept awake by the pain in his \nwounded leg, gazed with wide-open eyes at this \nstrange apparition of a girl in a white chemise, \ndressing jacket, and nightcap. The valet's \nsleepy, frightened exclamation, "What do you \nwant? What's the matter?" made Natdsha ap- \nproach more swiftly to what was lying in the \ncorner. Horribly unlike a man as that body \nlooked, she must see him. She passed the valet, \nthe snuff fell from the candle wick, and she saw \nPrince Andrew clearly with his arms outside \nthe quilt, and such as she had always seen him. \n\nHe was the same as ever, but the feverish \ncolor of his face, his glittering eyes rapturously \nturned toward her, and especially his neck, \ndelicate as a child's, revealed by the turn-down \n\n\n\ncollar of his shirt, gave him a peculiarly inno- \ncent, childlike look, such as she had never seen \non him before. She went up to him and with \na swift, flexible, youthful movement dropped \non her knees. \n\nHe smiled and held out his hand to her. \n\nCHAPTER XXXII \n\nSEVEN DAYS had passed since Prince Andrew \nfound himself in the ambulance station on the \nfield of Borodin6. His feverish state and the \ninflammation of his bowels, which were in- \njured, were in the doctor's opinion sure to \ncarry him off. But on the seventh day he ate \nwith pleasure a piece of bread with some tea, \nand the doctor noticed that his temperature \nwas lower. He had regained consciousness that \nmorning. The first night after they left Mos- \ncow had been fairly warm and he had remained \nin the caltche, but at Mytishchi the wounded \nman himself asked to be taken out and given \nsome tea. The pain caused by his removal into \nthe hut had made him groan aloud and again \nlose consciousness. When he had been placed \non his camp bed he lay for a long time motion- \nless with closed eyes. Then he opened them \nand whispered softly: "And the tea?" His re- \nmembering such a small detail of everyday life \nastonished the doctor. He felt Prince Andrew's \npulse, and to his surprise and dissatisfaction \nfound it had improved. He was dissatisfied be- \ncause he knew by experience that if his patient \ndid not die now, he would do so a little later \nwith greater suffering. Tim6khin, the red-nosed \nmajor of Prince Andrew's regiment, had joined \nhim in Moscow and was being taken along \nwith him, having been wounded in the leg at \nthe battleofBorodin6. They were accompanied \nby a doctor, Prince Andrew's valet, his coach- \nman, and two orderlies. \n\nThey gave Prince Andrew some tea. He \ndrank it eagerly, looking with feverish eyes at \nthe door in front of him as if trying to under- \nstand and remember something. \n\n"I don't want any more. Is Tim6khin here?" \nhe asked. \n\nTim6khin crept along the bench to him. \n\n"I am here, your excellency." \n\n"How's your wound?" \n\n"Mine, sir? All right. But how about you?" \n\nPrince Andrew again pondered as if trying \nto remember something. \n\n"Couldn't one get a book?" he asked. \n\n"What book?" \n\n"The Gospels. I haven't one." \n\nThe doctor promised to procure it for him \n\n\n\nBOOK \n\nand began to ask how he was feeling. Prince \nAndrew answered all his questions reluctantly \nbut reasonably, and then said he wanted a \nbolster placed under him as he was uncomfort- \nable and in great pain. The doctor and valet \nlifted the cloak with which he was covered and, \nmaking wry faces at the noisome smell of mor- \ntifying flesh that came from the wound, began \nexamining that dreadful place. The doctor was \nvery much displeased about something and \nmade a change in the dressings, turning the \nwounded man over so that he groaned again \nand grew unconscious and delirious from the \nagony. He kept asking them to get him the \nbook and put it under him. \n\n"What trouble would it be to you?" he said. \n"I have not got one. Please get it for me and \nput it under me for a moment," he pleaded in \na piteous voice. \n\nThe doctor went into the passage to wash his \nhands. \n\n"You fellows have no conscience," said he to \nthe valet who was pouring water over his \nhands. "For just one moment I didn't look aft- \ner you ... It's such pain, you know, that I \nwonder how he can bear it." \n\n"By the Lord Jesus Christ, I thought we had \nput something under him!" said the valet. \n\nThe first time Prince Andrew understood \nwhere he was and what was the matter with \nhim and remembered being wounded and how \nwas when he asked to be carried into the hut \nafter his caliche had stopped at Mytishchi. Aft- \ner growing confused from pain while being \ncarried into the hut he again regained con- \nsciousness, and while drinking tea once more \nrecalled all that had happened to him, and \nabove all vividly remembered the moment at \nthe ambulance station when, at the sight of \nthe sufferings of a man he disliked, those new \nthoughts had come to him which promised \nhim happiness. And those thoughts, though \nnow vague and indefinite, again possessed his \nsoul. He remembered that he had now a new \nsource of happiness and that this happiness \nhad something to do with the Gospels. That \nwas why he asked for a copy of them. The un- \ncomfortable position in which they had put \nhim and turned him over again confused his \nthoughts, and when he came to himself a third \ntime it was in the complete stillness of the \nnight. Everybody near him was sleeping. A \ncricket chirped from across the passage; some- \none was shouting and singing in the street; \ncockroaches rustled on the table, on the icons, \nand on the walls, and a big fly flopped at the \n\n\n\nELEVEN 525 \n\nhead of the bed and around the candle beside \nhim, the wick of which was charred and had \nshaped itself like a mushroom. \n\nHis mind was not in a normal state. A \nhealthy man usually thinks of, feels, and re- \nmembers innumerable things simultaneously, \nbut has the power and will to select one se- \nquence of thoughts or events on which to fix \nhis whole attention. A healthy man can tear \nhimself away from the deepest reflections to \nsay a civil word to someone who comes in and \ncan then return again to his own thoughts. \nBut Prince Andrew's mind was not in a normal \nstate in that respect. All the powers of his mind \nwere more active and clearer than ever, but \nthey acted apart from his will. Most diverse \nthoughts and images occupied him simultane- \nously. At times his brain suddenly began to \nwork with a vigor, clearness, and depth it had \nnever reached when he was in health, but sud- \ndenly in the midst of its work it would turn to \nsome unexpected idea and he had not the \nstrength to turn it back again. \n\n"Yes, a new happiness was revealed to me of \nwhich man cannot be deprived," he thought \nas he lay in the semi-darkness of the quiet hut, \ngazing fixedly before him with feverish, wide- \nopen eyes. "A happiness lying beyond material \nforces, outside the material influences that act \non mana happiness of the soul alone, the \nhappiness of loving. Every man can under- \nstand it, but to conceive it and enjoin it was \npossible only for God. But how did God en- \njoin that law? And why was the Son . . . ?" \n\nAnd suddenly the sequence of these thoughts \nbroke off, and Prince Andrew heard (without \nknowing whether it was a delusion or reality) \na soft whispering voice incessantly and rhyth- \nmically repeating "piti-piti-piti," and then "ti- \nti," and then again "piti-piti-piti," and "ti-ti" \nonce more. At the same time he felt that above \nhis face, above the very middle of it, some \nstrange airy structure was being erected out of \nslender needles or splinters, to the sound of \nthis whispered music. He felt that he had to \nbalance carefully (though it was difficult) so \nthat this airy structure should not collapse; but \nnevertheless it kept collapsing and again slow- \nly rising to the sound of whispered rhythmic \nmusic "it stretches, stretches, spreading out \nand stretching," said Prince Andrew to him- \nself. While listening to this whispering and \nfeeling the sensation of this drawing out and \nthe construction of this edifice of needles, he \nalso saw by glimpses a red halo round the \ncandle, and heard the rustle of the cockroaches \n\n\n\n526 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nand the buzzing of the fly that flopped against \nhis pillow and his face. Each time the fly \ntouched his face it gave him a burning sensa- \ntion and yet to his surprise it did not destroy \nthe structure, though it knocked against the \nvery region of his face where it was rising. But \nbesides this there was something else of im- \nportance. It was something white by the door \nthe statue of a sphinx, which also oppressed \nhim. \n\n"But perhaps that's my shirt on the table," \nhe thought, "and that's my legs, and that is \nthe door, but why is it always stretching and \ndrawing itself out, and 'piti-piti-piti' and 'ti-ti* \nand 'piti-piti-piti' . . . ? That's enough, please \nleave off!" Prince Andrew painfully entreated \nsomeone. And suddenly thoughts and feelings \nagain swam to the surface of his mind with \npeculiar clearness and force. \n\n"Yes love," he thought again quite clearly. \n"But not love which loves for something, for \nsome quality, for some purpose, or for some \nreason, but the love which I while dying- \nfirst experienced when I saw my enemy and yet \nloved him. I experienced that feeling of love \nwhich is the very essence of the soul and does \nnot require an object. Now again I feel that \nbliss. To love one's neighbors, to love one's \nenemies, to love everything, to love God in \nall His manifestations. It is possible to love \nsomeone dear to you with human love, but an \nenemy can only be loved by divine love. That \nis why I experienced such joy when I felt that \nI loved that man. What has become of him? Is \nhe alive? . . . \n\n"When loving with human love one may \npass from love to hatred, but divine love can- \nnot change. No, neither death nor anything \nelse can destroy it. It is the very essence of the \nsoul. Yet how many people have I hated in my \nlife? And of them all, I loved and hated none \nas I did her." And he vividly pictured to him- \nself Natdsha, not as he had done in the past \nwith nothing but her charms which gave him \ndelight, but for the first time picturing to him- \nself her soul. And he understood her feelings, \nher sufferings, shame, and remorse. He now \nunderstood for the first time all the cruelty of \nhis rejection of her, the cruelty of his rupture \nwith her. "If only it were possible for me to see \nher once more! Just once, looking into those \neyes to say . . ." \n\n"Piti-piti-piti and ti-ti and piti-piti-piti \nboom!" flopped the fly. ... And his attention \nwas suddenly carried into another world, a \nworld of reality and delirium in which some- \n\n\n\nthing particular was happening. In that world \nsome structure was still being erected and did \nnot fall, something was still stretching out, and \nthe candle with its red halo was still burning, \nand the same shir tl ike sphinx lay near the \ndoor; but besides all this something creaked, \nthere was a whiff of fresh air, and a new white \nsphinx appeared, standing at the door. And \nthat sphinx had the pale face and shining eyes \nof the very Natdsha of whom he had just been \nthinking. \n\n"Oh, how oppressive this continual delirium \nis," thought Prince Andrew, trying to drive \nthat face from his imagination. But the face \nremained before him with the force of reality \nand drew nearer. Prince Andrew wished to re- \nturn to that former world of pure thought, but \nhe could not, and delirium drew him back into \nits domain. The soft whispering voice con- \ntinued its rhythmic murmur, something op- \npressed him and stretched out, and the strange \nface was before him. Prince Andrew collected \nall his strength in an effort to recover his senses, \nhe moved a little, and suddenly there was a \nringing in his ears, a dimness in his eyes, and \nlike a man plunged into water he lost con- \nsciousness. When he came to himself, Natdsha, \nthat same living Natdsha whom of all people \nhe most longed to love wtih this new pure \ndivine love that had been revealed to him, was \nkneeling before him. He realized that it was \nthe real living Natdsha, and he was not sur- \nprised but quietly happy. Natdsha, motionless \non her knees (she was unable to stir), with \nfrightened eyes riveted on him, was restraining \nher sobs. Her face was pale and rigid. Only in \nthe lower part of it something quivered. \n\nPrince Andrew sighed with relief, smiled, \nand held out his hand. \n\n"You?" he said. "How fortunatel" \n\nWith a rapid but careful movement Natdsha \ndrew nearer to him on her knees and, taking \nhis hand carefully, bent her face over it and \nbegan kissing it, just touching it lightly with \nher lips. \n\n"Forgive me!" she whispered, raising her \nhead and glancing at him. "Forgive me!" \n\n"I love you," said Prince Andrew. \n\n"Forgive ... I" \n\n"Forgive what?" he asked. \n\n"Forgive me for what I ha-ve do-ne!" fal- \ntered Natdsha in a scarcely audible, broken \nwhisper, and began kissing his hand more \nrapidly, just touching it with her lips. \n\n"I love you more, better than before," said \nPrince Andrew, lifting her face with his hand \n\n\n\nBOOK ELEVEN \n\n\n\n527 \n\n\n\nso as to look into her eyes. \n\nThose eyes, filled with happy tears, gazed at \nhim timidly, compassionately, and with joyous \nlove. Natasha's thin pale face, with its swollen \nlips, was more than plain it was dreadful. But \nPrince Andrew did not see that, he saw her \nshining eyes which were beautiful. They heard \nthe sound of voices behind them. \n\nPeter the valet, who was now wide awake, \nhad roused the doctor. Tim6khin, who had not \nslept at all because of the pain in his leg, had \nlong been watching all that was going on, care- \nfully covering his bare body with the sheet as \nhe huddled up on his bench. \n\n"What's this?" said the doctor, rising from \nhis bed. "Please go away, madam!" \n\nAt that moment a maid sent by the countess, \nwho had noticed her daughter's absence, \nknocked at the door. \n\nLike a somnambulist aroused from her sleep \nNatasha went out of the room and, returning \nto her hut, fell sobbing on her bed. \n\nFrom that time, during all the rest of the \nRostovs' journey, at every halting place and \nwherever they spent a night, Natdsha never \nleft the wounded Bolk6nski, and the doctor \nhad to admit that he had not expected from a \nyoung girl either such firmness or such skill in \nnursing a wounded man. \n\nDreadful as the countess imagined it would \nbe should Prince Andrew die in her daughter's \narms during the journey as, judging by what \nthe doctor said, it seemed might easily happen \nshe could not oppose Natasha. Though with \nthe intimacy now established between the \nwounded man and Natasha the thought oc- \ncurred that should he recover their former en- \ngagement would be renewed, no one least of \nall Natasha and Prince Andrew spoke of this: \nthe unsettled question of life and death, which \nhung not only over Bolk6nski but over all \nRussia, shut out all other considerations. \n\nCHAPTER XXXIII \n\nON THE THIRD OF SEPTEMBER Pierre awoke late. \nHis head was aching, the clothes in which he \nhad slept without undressing felt uncomfort- \nable on his body, and his mind had a dim con- \nsciousness of something shameful he had done \nthe day before. That something shameful was \nhis yesterday's conversation with Captain Ram- \nballe. \n\nIt was eleven by the clock, but it seemed \npeculiarly dark out of doors. Pierre rose, \nrubbed his eyes, and seeing the pistol with an \n\n\n\nengraved stock which Gerasim had replaced \non the writing table, he remembered where he \nwas and what lay before him that very day. \n\n"Am I not too late?" he thought. "No, prob- \nably he won't make his entry into Moscow be- \nfore noon." \n\nPierre did not allow himself to reflect on \nwhat lay before him, but hastened to act. \n\nAfter arranging his clothes, he took the pis- \ntol and was about to go out. But it then oc- \ncurred to him for the first time that he certain- \nly could not carry the weapon in his hand \nthrough the streets. It was difficult to hide such \na big pistol even under his wide coat. He could \nnot carry it unnoticed in his belt or under his \narm. Besides, it had been discharged, and he \nhad not had time to reload it. "No matter, the \ndagger will do," he said to himself, though \nwhen planning his design he had more than \nonce come to the conclusion that the chief \nmistake made by the student in 1809 had been \nto try to kill Napoleon with a dagger. But as \nhis chief aim consisted not in carrying out his \ndesign, but in proving to himself that he would \nnot abandon his intention and was doing all \nhe could to achieve it, Pierre hastily took the \nblunt jagged dagger in a green sheath which \nhe had bought at the Sukharev market with \nthe pistol, and hid it under his waistcoat. \n\nHaving tied a girdle over his coat and pulled \nhis cap low on his head, Pierre went down the \ncorridor, trying to avoid making a noise or \nmeeting the captain, and passed out into the \nstreet. \n\nThe conflagration, at which he had looked \nwith so much indifference the evening before, \nhad greatly increased during the night. Mos- \ncow was on fire in several places. The build- \nings in Carriage Row, across the river, in the \nBazaar and the Povarsk6y, as well as the barges \non the Moskva* River and the timber yards by \nthe Dorogomflov Bridge, were all ablaze. \n\nPierre's way led through side streets to the \nPovarskoy and from there to the church of St. \nNicholas on the Arbat, where he had long be- \nfore decided that the deed should be done. The \ngates of most of the houses were locked and \nthe shutters up. The streets and lanes were \ndeserted. The air was full of smoke and the \nsmell of burning. Now and then he met Rus- \nsians with anxious and timid faces, and French- \nmen with an air not of the city but of the \ncamp, walking in the middle of the streets. \nBoth the Russians and the French looked at \nPierre with surprise. Besides his height and \nstoutness, and the strange morose look of suf- \n\n\n\n5*8 \n\nfering in his face and whole figure, the Rus- \nsians stared at him because they could not make \nout to what class he could belong. The French \nfollowed him with astonishment in their eyes \nchiefly because Pierre, unlike all the other Rus- \nsians who gazed at the French with fear and \ncuriosity, paid no attention to them. At the \ngate of one house three Frenchmen, who were \nexplaining something to some Russians who \ndid not understand them, stopped Pierre ask- \ning if he did not know French. \n\nPierre shook his head and went on. In an- \nother side street a sentinel standing beside a \ngreen caisson shouted at him, but only when \nthe shout was threateningly repeated and he \nheard the click of the man's musket as he \nraised it did Pierre understand that he had to \npass on the other side of the street. He heard \nnothing and saw nothing of what went on \naround him. He carried his resolution within \nhimself in terror and haste, like something \ndreadful and alien to him, for, after the previ- \nous night's experience, he was afraid of losing \nit. But he was not destined to bring his mood \nsafely to his destination. And even had he not \nbeen hindered by anything on the way, his \nintention could not now have been carried out, \nfor Napoleon had passed the Arbat more than \nfour hours previously on his way from the Do- \nrogomflov suburb to the Kremlin, and was \nnow sitting in a very gloomy frame of mind in \na royal study in the Kremlin, giving detailed \nand exact orders as to measures to be taken im- \nmediately to extinguish the fire, to prevent \nlooting, and to reassure the inhabitants. But \nPierre did not know this; he was entirely ab- \nsorbed in what lay before him, and was tor- \nturedas those are who obstinately undertake \na task that is impossible for them not because \nof its difficulty but because of its incompati- \nbility with their natures by the fear of weaken- \ning at the decisive moment and so losing his \nself-esteem. \n\nThough he heard and saw nothing around \nhim he found his way by instinct and did not \ngo wrong in the side streets that led to the \nPovarsk6y. \n\nAs Pierre approached that street the smoke \nbecame denser and denser he even felt the \nheat of the fire. Occasionally curly tongues of \nflame rose from under the roofs of the houses. \nHe met more people in the streets and they \nwere more excited. But Pierre, though he felt \nthat something unusual was happening around \nhim, did not realize that he was approaching \nthe fire. As he was going along a footpath across \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\na wide-open space adjoining the Povarsk6y on \none side and the gardens of Prince Gruzfnski's \nhouse on the other, Pierre suddenly heard the \ndesperate weeping of a woman close to him. \nHe stopped as if awakening from a dream and \nlifted his head. \n\nBy the side of the path, on the dusty dry \ngrass, all sorts of household goods lay in a \nheap : feather beds, a samovar, icons, and trunks. \nOn the ground, beside the trunks, sat a thin \nwoman no longer young, with long, prominent \nupper teeth, and wearing a black cloak and \ncap. This woman, swaying to and fro and mut- \ntering something, was choking with sobs. Two \ngirls of about ten and twelve, dressed in dirty \nshort frocks and cloaks, were staring at their \nmother with a look of stupefaction on their \npale frightened faces. The youngest child, a \nboy of about seven, who wore an overcoat and \nan immense cap evidently not his own, was \ncrying in his old nurse's arms. A dirty, bare- \nfooted maid was sitting on a trunk, and, hav- \ning undone her pale-colored plait, was pulling \nit straight and sniffing at her singed hair. The \nwoman's husband, a short, round-shouldered \nman in the undress uniform of a civilian of- \nficial, with sausage-shaped whiskers and show- \ning under his square-set cap the hair smoothly \nbrushed forward over his temples, with ex- \npressionless face was moving the trunks, which \nwere placed one on another, and was dragging \nsome garments from under them. \n\nAs soon as she saw Pierre, the woman almost \nthrew herself at his feet. \n\n"Dear people, good Christians, save me, help \nme, dear friends . . . help us, somebody," she \nmuttered between her sobs. "My girl . . . My \ndaughter 1 My youngest daughter is left be- \nhind. She's burned! Ooh! Was it for this I \nnursed you. . . . Ooh!" \n\n"Don't, Mary Nikoldevna!" said her hus- \nband to her in a low voice, evidently only to \njustify himself before the stranger. "Sister must \nhave taken her, or else where can she be?" he \nadded. \n\n"Monster! Villain!" shouted the woman an- \ngrily, suddenly ceasing to weep. "You have no \nheart, you don't feel for your own child! An- \nother man would have rescued her from the \nfire. But this is a monster and neither a man \nnor a father! You, honored sir, are a noble \nman," she went on, addressing Pierre rapidly \nbetween her sobs. "The fire broke out along- \nside, and blew our way, the maid called out \nTire!' and we rushed to collect our things. We \nran out just as we were. . . . This is what we \n\n\n\nBOOK ELEVEN \n\n\n\n529 \n\n\n\nhave brought away. . . . The icons, and my \ndowry bed, all the rest is lost. We seized the \nchildren. But not Katie! Oohl O Lord! . . ." \nand again she began to sob. "My child, my dear \none! Burned, burned!" \n\n"But where was she left?" asked Pierre. \n\nFrom the expression of his animated face \nthe woman saw that this man might help her. \n\n"Oh, dear sir!" she cried, seizing him by the \nlegs. "My benefactor, set my heart at ease. . . . \nAnfska,go, you horrid girl, show him the way!" \nshe cried to the maid, angrily opening her \nmouth and still farther exposing her long \nteeth. \n\n"Show me the way, show me, I ... I'll do it," \ngasped Pierre rapidly. \n\nThe dirty maidservant stepped from behind \nthe trunk, put up her plait, sighed, and went \non her short, bare feet along the path. Pierre \nfelt as if he had come back to life after a heavy \nswoon. He held his head higher, his eyes shone \nwith the light of life, and with swift steps he \nfollowed the maid, overtook her, and came out \non the Povarsk6y. The whole street was full of \nclouds of black smoke. Tongues of flame here \nand there broke through that cloud. A great \nnumber of people crowded in front of the con- \nflagration. In the middle of the street stood a \nFrench general saying something to those \naround him. Pierre, accompanied by the maid, \nwas advancing to the spot where the general \nstood, but the French soldiers stopped him. \n\n"On ne passe pas!" * cried a voice. \n\n"This way, uncle," cried the girl. "We'll pass \nthrough the side street, by the Nikulins'I" \n\nPierre turned back, giving a spring now and \nthen to keep up with her. She ran across the \nstreet, turned down a side street to the left, \nand, passing three houses, turned into a yard \non the right. \n\n"It's here, close by," said she and, running \nacross the yard, opened a gate in a wooden \nfence and, stopping, pointed out to him a small \nwooden wing of the house, which was burning \nbrightly and fiercely. One of its sides had fallen \nin, another was on fire, and bright flames issued \nfrom the openings of the windows and from \nunder the roof. \n\nAs Pierre passed through the fence gate, he \nwas enveloped by hot air and involuntarily \nstopped. \n\n"Which is it? Which is your house?" he \nasked. \n\n"Ooh!" wailed the girl, pointing to the wing. \n"That's it, that was our lodging. You've burned \n\n10 You can't pass!" \n\n\n\nto death, our treasure, Katie, my precious little \nmissy! Ooh!" lamented Aniska, who at the \nsight of the fire felt that she too must give ex- \npression to her feelings. \n\nPierre rushed to the wing, but the heat was \nso great that he involuntarily passed round in \na curve and came upon the large house that \nwas as yet burning only at one end, just below \nthe roof, and around which swarmed a crowd \nof Frenchmen. At first Pierre did not realize \nwhat these men, who were dragging something \nout, were about; but seeing before him a \nFrenchman hitting a peasant with a blunt sa- \nber and trying to take from him a fox-fur coat, \nhe vaguely understood that looting was going \non there, but he had no time to dwell on that \nidea. \n\nThe sounds of crackling and the din of fall- \ning walls and ceilings, the whistle and hiss of \nthe flames, the excited shouts of the people, \nand the sight of the swayingsmoke, now gather- \ning into thick black clouds and now soaring \nup with glittering sparks, with here and there \ndense sheaves of flame (now red and now like \ngolden fish scales creeping along the walls), \nand the heat and smoke and rapidity of mo- \ntion, produced on Pierre the usual animating \neffects of a conflagration. It had a peculiarly \nstrong effect on him because at the sight of the \nfire he felt himself suddenly freed from the \nideas that had weighed him down. He felt \nyoung, bright, adroit, and resolute. He ran \nround to the other side of the lodge and was \nabout to dash into that part of it which was \nstill standing, when just above his head he \nheard several voices shouting and then a crack- \ning sound and the ring of something heavy \nfalling close beside him. \n\nPierre looked up and saw at a window of the \nlarge house some Frenchmen who had just \nthrown out the drawer of a chest, filled with \nmetal articles. Other French soldiers standing \nbelow went up to the drawer. \n\n"What does this fellow want?" shouted one \nof them referring to Pierre. \n\n"There's a child in that house. Haven't you \nseen a child?" cried Pierre. \n\n"What's he talking about? Get along!" said \nseveral voices, and one of the soldiers, evident- \nly afraid that Pierre might want to take from \nthem some of the plate and bronzes that were \nin the drawer, moved threateningly toward \nhim. \n\n"A child?" shouted a Frenchman fromabove. \n"I did hear something squealing in the garden. \nPerhaps it's his brat that the fellow is look- \n\n\n\n53 \n\ning for. After all, one must be human, you \n\nknow. . . ." \n\n"Where is it? Where?" said Pierre. \n\n"There! There!" shouted the Frenchman at \nthe window, pointing to the garden at the back \nof the house. "Wait a bit I'm coming down." \n\nAnd a minute or two later the Frenchman, a \nblack-eyed fellow with a spot on his cheek, in \nshirt sleeves, really did jump out of a window \non the ground floor, and clapping Pierre on \nthe shoulder ran with him into the garden. \n\n"Hurry up, you others!" he called out to his \ncomrades. "It's getting hot." \n\nWhen they reached a gravel path behind \nthe house the Frenchman pulled Pierre by the \narm and pointed to a round, graveled space \nwhere a three-year-old girl in a pink dress was \nlying under a seat. \n\n"There is your child! Oh, a girl, so much the \nbetter!" said the Frenchman. "Good-by, Fatty. \nWe must be human, we are all mortal you \nknow!" and the Frenchman with the spot on \nhis cheek ran back to his comrades. \n\nBreathless with joy, Pierre ran to the little \ngirl and was going to take her in his arms. But \nseeing a stranger the sickly, scrofulous-looking \nchild, unattractively like her mother, began to \nyell and run away. Pierre, however, seized her \nand lifted her in his arms. She screamed des- \nperately and angrily and tried with her little \nhands to pull Pierre's hands away and to bite \nthem with her slobbering mouth. Pierre was \nseized by a sense of horror and repulsion such \nas he had experienced when touching some \nnasty little animal. But he made an effort not \nto throw the child down and ran with her to \nthe large house. It was now, however, impossi- \nble to get back the way he had come; the maid, \nAnfska, was no longer there, and Pierre with a \nfeeling of pity and disgust pressed the wet, \npainfully sobbing child to himself as tenderly \nas he could and ran with her through the gar- \nden seeking another way out. \n\nCHAPTER XXXIV \n\nHAVING RUN through different yards and side \nstreets, Pierre got back with his little burden \nto the Gruzfnski garden at the corner of the \nPovarsk6y. He did not at first recognize the \nplace from which he had set out to look for the \nchild, so crowded was it now with people and \ngoods that had been dragged out of the houses. \nBesides Russian families who had taken refuge \nhere from the fire with their belongings, there \nwere several French soldiers in a variety of \nclothing. Pierre took no notice of them. He \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\nhurried to find the family of that civil servant \nin order to restore the daughter to her mother \nand go to save someone else. Pierre felt that he \nhad still much to do and to do quickly. Glow- \ning with the heat and from running, he felt at \nthat moment more strongly than ever the sense \nof youth, animation, and determination that \nhad come on him when he ran to save the \nchild. She had now become quiet and, clinging \nwith her little hands to Pierre's coat, sat on his \narm gazing about her like some little wild ani- \nmal. He glanced at her occasionally with a \nslight smile. He fancied he saw something \npathetically innocent in that frightened, sickly \nlittle face. \n\nHe did not find the civil servant or his wife \nwhere he had left them. He walked among the \ncrowd with rapid steps, scanning the various \nfaces he met. Involuntarily he noticed a Geor- \ngian or Armenian family consisting of a very \nhandsome old man of Oriental type, wearing \na new, cloth-covered, sheepskin coat and new \nboots, an old woman of similar type, and a \nyoung woman. That very young woman seemed \nto Pierre the perfection of Oriental beauty, \nwith her sharply outlined, arched, black eye- \nbrows and the extraordinarily soft, bright col- \nor of her long, beautiful, expressionless face. \nAmid the scattered property and the crowd on \nthe open space, she, in her rich satin cloak \nwith a bright lilac shawl on her head, suggested \na delicate exotic plant thrown out onto the \nsnow. She was sitting on some bundles a little \nbehind the old woman, and looked from un- \nder her long lashes with motionless, large, al- \nmond-shaped eyes at the ground before her. \nEvidently she was aware of her beauty and \nfearful because of it. Her face struck Pierre \nand, hurrying along by the fence, he turned \nseveral times to look at her. When he had \nreached the fence, still without finding those \nhe sought, he stopped and looked about him. \n\nWith the child in his arms his figure was now \nmore conspicuous than before, and a group of \nRussians, both men and women, gathered \nabout him. \n\n"Have you lost anyone, my dear fellow? \nYou're of the gentry yourself, aren't you? \nWhose child is it?" they asked him. \n\nPierre replied that the child belonged to a \nwoman in a black coat who had been sitting \nthere with her other children, and he asked \nwhether anyone knew where she had gone. \n\n"Why, that must be the Anferovs," said an \nold deacon, addressing a pockmarked peasant \nwoman. "Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy!" \n\n\n\nhe added in his customary bass. \n\n"The Anfrovs?No," said the woman. "They \nleft in the morning. That must be either Mary \nNikoldevna's or the Ivanovs'l" \n\n"He says 'a woman/ and Mary Nikoldevna \nis a lady," remarked a house serf. \n\n"Do you know her? She's thin, with long \nteeth," said Pierre. \n\n"That's Mary Nikoldevna! They went in- \nside the garden when these wolves swooped \ndown," said the woman, pointing totheFrench \nsoldiers. \n\n"O Lord, have mercy!" added the deacon. \n\n"Go over that way, they're there. It's shel \nShe kept on lamenting and crying," continued \nthe woman. "It's she. Here, this way!" \n\nBut Pierre was not listening to the woman. \nHe had for some seconds been intently watch- \ning what was going on a few steps away. He \nwas looking at the Armenian family and at \ntwo French soldiers who had gone up to them. \nOne of these, a nimble little man, was wearing \na blue coat tied round the waist with a rope. \nHe had a nightcap on his head and his feet \nwere bare. The other, whose appearance par- \nticularly struck Pierre, was a long, lank, round- \nshouldered, fair-haired man, slow in his move- \nments and with an idiotic expression of face. \nHe wore a woman's loose gown of frieze, blue \ntrousers, and large torn Hessian boots. The \nlittle barefooted Frenchman in the blue coat \nwent up to the Armenians and, saying some- \nthing, immediately seized the old man by his \nlegs and the old man at once began pulling off \nhis boots. The other in the frieze gown stopped \nin front of the beautiful Armenian girl and \nwith his hctnds in his pockets stood staring at \nher, motionless and silent. \n\n"Here, take the child!" said Pierre peremp- \ntorily and hurriedly to the woman, handing \nthe little girl to her. "Give her back to them, \ngive her back!" he almost shouted, putting the \nchild, who began screaming, on the ground, \nand again looking at the Frenchman and the \nArmenian family. \n\nThe old man was already sitting barefoot. \nThe little Frenchman had secured his second \nboot and was slapping one boot against the \nother. The old man was saying something in a \nvoice broken by sobs, but Pierre caught but a \nglimpse of this, his whole attention was di- \nrected to the Frenchman in the frieze gown \nwho meanwhile, swaying slowly from side to \nside, had drawn nearer to the young woman \nand taking his hands from his pockets had \nseized her by the neck. \n\n\n\nBOOK ELEVEN 531 \n\nThe beautiful Armenian still sat motionless \nand in the same attitude, with her long lashes \ndrooping as if she did not see or feel what the \nsoldier was doing to her. \n\nWhile Pierre was running the few steps that \nseparated him from the Frenchman, the tall \nmarauder in the frieze gown was already tear- \ning from her neck the necklace the young \nArmenian was wearing, and the young wom- \nan, clutching at her neck, screamed pierc- \ningly. \n\n"Let that woman alone!" exclaimed Pierre \nhoarsely in a furious voice, seizing the soldier \nby his round shoulders and throwing him \naside. \n\nThe soldier fell, got up, and ran away. But \nhis comrade, throwing down the boots and \ndrawing his sword, moved threateningly to- \nward Pierre. \n\n"Voyons, pas de bStises!" * he cried. \n\nPierre was in such a transport of rage that \nhe remembered nothing and his strength in- \ncreased tenfold. He rushed at the barefooted \nFrenchman and, before the latter had time to \ndraw his sword, knocked him off his feet and \nhammered him with his fists. Shouts of ap- \nproval were heard from the crowd around, and \nat the same moment a mounted patrol of French \nUhlans appeared from round the corner. The \nUhlans came up at a trot to Pierre and the \nFrenchman and surrounded them. Pierre re- \nmembered nothing of what happened after \nthat. He only remembered beating someone \nand being beaten and finally feeling that his \nhands were bound and that a crowd of French \nsoldters stood around him and were searching \nhim. \n\n"Lieutenant, he has a dagger," were the \nfirst words Pierre understood. \n\n"Ah, a weapon?" said the officer and turned \nto the barefooted soldier who had been ar- \nrested with Pierre. "All right, you can tell all \nabout it at the court-martial." Then he turned \nto Pierre. "Do you speak French?" \n\nPierre looked around him with bloodshot \neyes and did not reply. His face probably looked \nvery terrible, for the officer said something in \na whisper and four more Uhlans left the \nranks and placed themselves on both sides of \nPierre. \n\n"Do you speak French?" the officer asked \nagain, keeping at a distance from Pierre. "Call \nthe interpreter." \n\nA little man in Russian civilian clothes rode \nout from the ranks, and by his clothes and \n\n1 "Look here, no nonsense!" \n\n\n\n532 WAR AND PEACE \n\nmanner of speaking Pierre at once knew him \nto be a French salesman from one of the Mos- \ncow shops. \n\n"He does not look like a common man/' said \nthe interpreter, after a searching look at Pierre. \n\n"Ah, he looks very much like an incendiary," \nremarked the officer. "And ask him who he is," \nhe added. \n\n"Who are you?" asked the interpreter in \npoor Russian. "You must answer the chief." \n\n"I will not tell you who I am. I am your \nprisoner take me!" Pierre suddenly replied in \nFrench. \n\n"Ah, ah!" muttered the officer with a frown. \n"Well then, march!" \n\nA crowd had collected round the Uhlans. \nNearest to Pierre stood the pockmarked peas- \nant woman with the little girl, and when the \npatrol started she moved forward. \n\n"Where are they taking you to, you poor \ndear?" said she. "And the little girl, the little \ngirl, what am I to do with her if she's not \ntheirs?" said the woman. \n\n"What does that woman want?" asked the \nofficer. \n\nPierre was as if intoxicated. His elation in- \n\n\n\ncreased at the sight of the little girl he had \nsaved. \n\n"What does she want?" he murmured. "She \nis bringing me my daughter whom I have just \nsaved from the flames," said he. "Good-by!" \nAnd without knowing how this aimless lie had \nescaped him, he went along with resolute and \ntriumphant steps between the French soldiers. \n\nThe French patrol was one of those sent out \nthrough the various streets of Moscow by Du- \nrosnel's order to put a stop to the pillage, and \nespecially to catch the incendiaries who, ac- \ncording to the general opinion which had \nthat day originated among the higher French \nofficers, were the cause of the conflagrations. \nAfter marching through a number of streets the \npatrol arrested five more Russian suspects: a \nsmall shopkeeper, two seminary students, a \npeasant, and a house serf, besides several \nlooters. But of all these various suspected \ncharacters, Pierre was considered to be the \nmost suspicious of all. When they had all \nbeen brought for the night to a large house \non the Zubov Rampart that was being used as \na guardhouse, Pierre was placed apart under \nstrict guard. \n\n\n\nBook Twelve: 1812 \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I \n\nIN PETERSBURG at that time a complicated \nstruggle was being carried on with greater heat \nthan ever in the highest circles, between the \nparties of Rumyantsev, the French, Marya Fe- \ndorovna, the Tsarvich, and others, drowned \nas usual by the buzzing of the court drones. But \nthe calm, luxurious life of Petersburg, con- \ncerned only about phantoms and reflections \nof real life, went on in its old way and made it \nhard, except by a great effort, to realize the \ndanger and the difficult position of the Rus- \nsian people. There were the same receptions \nand balls, the same French theater, the same \ncourt interests and service interests and in- \ntrigues as usual. Only in the very highest cir- \ncles were attempts made to keep in mind the \ndifficulties of the actual position. Stories were \nwhispered of how differently the two Empresses \nbehaved in these difficult circumstances. The \nEmpress Marya, concerned for the welfare of \nthe charitable and educational institutions un- \nder her patronage, had given directions that \nthey should all be removed to Kazdn, and the \nthings belonging to these institutions had al- \nready been packed up. The Empress Elisabeth, \nhowever, when asked what instructions she \nwould be pleased to give with her characteris- \ntic Russian patriotism had replied that she \ncould give no directions about state institu- \ntions for that was the affair of the sovereign, \nbut as far as she personally was concerned she \nwould be the last to quit Petersburg. \n\nAt Anna Pavlovna's on the twenty-sixth of \nAugust, the very day of the battle of Borodin6, \nthere was a soiree, the chief feature of which \nwas to be the reading of a letter from His Lord- \nship the Bishop when sending the Emperor \nan icon of the Venerable Sergius. It was re- \ngarded af a model of ecclesiastical, patriotic \neloquence. Prince Vasili himself, famed for his \nelocution, was to read it. (He used to read at \nthe Empress'.) The art of his reading was sup- \nposed to lie in rolling out the words, quite in- \ndependently of their meaning, in a loud and \n\n\n\nsingsong voice alternating between a despair- \ning wail and a tender murmur, so that the \nwail fell quite at random on one word and the \nmurmur on another. This reading, as was al- \nways the case at Anna Pavlovna's soirees, had \na political significance. That evening she ex- \npected several important personages who had \nto be made ashamed of their visits to the French \ntheater and aroused to a patriotic temper. A \ngood many people had already arrived, but \nAnna Pavlovna, not yet seeing all those whom \nshe wanted in her drawing room, did not let \nthe reading begin but wound up the springs of \na general conversation. \n\nThe news of the day in Petersburg was the \nillness of Countess Bezukhova. She had fallen \nill unexpectedly a few days previously, had \nmissed several gatherings of which she was \nusually the ornament, and was said to be receiv- \ning no one, and instead of the celebrated Pe- \ntersburg doctors who usually attended her had \nentrusted herself to some Italian doctor who \nwas treating her in some new and unusual \nway. \n\nThey all knew very well that the enchanting \ncountess' illness arose from an inconvenience \nresulting from marrying two husbands at the \nsame time, and that the Italian's cure consist- \ned in removing such inconvenience; but in \nAnna Pavlovna's presence no one dared to \nthink of this or even appear to know it. \n\n"They say the poor countess is very ill. The \ndoctor says it is angina pectoris." \n\n"Angina? Oh, that's a terrible illness!" \n\n"They say that the rivals are reconciled, \nthanks to the angina . . ." and the word angina \nwas repeated with great satisfaction. \n\n"The old count is pathetic, they say. He cried \nlike a child when the doctor told him the case \nwas dangerous." \n\n"Oh, it would be a terrible loss, she is an en- \nchanting woman." \n\n"You are speaking of the poor countess?" \nsaid Anna Pavlovna, coming up just then. "I \nsent to ask for news, and hear that she is a lit- \n\n\n\n534 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\ntie better. Oh, she is certainly the most charm- \ning woman in the world," she went on, with a \nsmile at her own enthusiasm. "We belong to \ndifferent camps, but that does not prevent my \nesteeming her as she deserves. She is very un- \nfortunate!" added Anna Pdvlovna. \n\nSupposing that by these words Anna Pav- \nlovna was somewhat lifting the veil from the \nsecret of the countess' malady, an unwary young \nman ventured to express surprise that well- \nknown doctors had not been called in and that \nthe countess was being attended by a charlatan \nwho might employ dangerous remedies. \n\n"Your information may be better than mine," \nAnna Pavlovna suddenly and venomously re- \ntorted on the inexperienced young man, "but \nI know on good authority that this doctor is a \nvery learned and able man. He is private phy- \nsician to the Queen of Spain." \n\nAnd having thus demolished the young man, \nAnna Pavlovna turned to another group where \nBilibin was talking about the Austrians: hav- \ning wrinkled up his face he was evidently pre- \nparing to smooth it out again and utter one of \nhis mots. \n\n"I think it is delightful," he said, referring \nto a diplomatic note that had been sent to Vi- \nenna with some Austrian banners captured \nfrom the French by Wittgenstein, "the hero of \nPetropol" as he was then called in Petersburg. \n\n"What? What's that?" asked Anna Pdvlovna, \nsecuring silence for the mot, which she had \nheard before. \n\nAnd Bilfbin repeated the actual words of \nthe diplomatic dispatch, which he had himself \ncomposed. \n\n"The Emperor returns these Austrian ban- \nners," said Bilibin, "friendly banners gone \nastray and found on a wrong path," and his \nbrow became smooth again. \n\n"Charming, charming!" observed Prince \nVasili. \n\n"The path to Warsaw, perhaps," Prince Hip- \npolyte remarked loudly and unexpectedly. Ev- \nerybody looked at him, not understanding what \nhe meant. Prince Hippolyte himself glanced \naround with amused surprise. He knew no \nmore than the others what his words meant. \nDuring his diplomatic career he had more than \nonce noticed that such utterances were re- \nceived as very witty, and at every opportunity \nhe uttered in that way the first words that en- \ntered his head. "It may turn out very well," he \nthought, "but if not, they'll know how to ar- \nrange matters." And really, during the awk- \nward silence that ensued, that insufficiently pa- \n\n\n\ntriotic person entered whom Anna Pdvlovna \nhad been waiting for and wished to convert, \nand she, smiling and shaking a finger at Hip- \npolyte, invited Prince Vasfli to the table and \nbringing him two candles and the manuscript \nbegged him to begin. Everyone became silent. \n\n"Most Gracious Sovereign and Emperor!" Prince \nVasili sternly declaimed, looking round at his au- \ndience as if to inquire whether anyone had any- \nthing to say to the contrary. But no one said any- \nthing. "Moscow, our ancient capital, the New Jeru- \nsalem, receives her Christ" he placed a sudden \nemphasis on the word her "as a mother receives \nher /calous sons into her arms, and through the \ngathering mists, foreseeing the brilliant glory of thy \nrule, sings in exultation, 'Hosanna, blessed is he \nthat cometh!' " \n\nPrince Vasili pronounced these last words \nin a tearful voice. \n\nBilibin attentively examined his nails, and \nmany of those present appeared intimidated, \nas if asking in what they were to blame. Anna \nPdvlovna whispered the next words in advance, \nlike an old woman muttering the prayer at \nCommunion: "Let the bold and insolent Goli- \nath . . ." she whispered. \n\nPrince Vasili continued. \n\n"Let the bold and insolent Goliath from the \nborders of France encompass the realms of Russia \nwith death-bearing terrors; humble Faith, the \nsling of the Russian David, shall suddenly smite his \nhead in his blood-thirsty pride. This icon of the \nVenerable Sergius, the servant of God and zealous \nchampion of old of our country's weal, is offered \nto Your Imperial Majesty. I grieve that my wan- \ning strength prevents my rejoicing in the sight of \nyour most gracious presence. 1 raise fervent prayers \nto Heaven that the Almighty may exalt the race of \nthe just, and mercifully fulfill the desires of Your \nMajesty." \n\n"What force! What a style!" was uttered in \napproval both of reader and of author. \n\nAnimated by that address Anna Pdvlovna's \nguests talked for a long time of the state of the \nfatherland and offered various conjectures as \nto the result of the battle to be fought in a few \ndays. \n\n"You will see," said Anna Pdvlovna, "that to- \nmorrow, on the Emperor's birthday, we shall \nreceive news. I have a favorable presentiment!" \n\nCHAPTER II \n\nANNA PAVLOVNA'S presentiment was in fact ful- \nfilled. Next day during the service at the palace \nchurch in honor of the Emperor's birthday, \nPrince Volkdnski was called out of the church \nand received a dispatch from Prince Kutuzov. \n\n\n\nBOOK TWELVE \n\n\n\n535 \n\n\n\nIt was Kutuzov's report, written from Tatari- \nnova on the day of the battle. Kunizov wrote \nthat the Russians had not retreated a step, that \nthe French losses were much heavier than ours, \nand that he was writing in haste from the field \nof battle before collecting full information. It \nfollowed that there must have been a victory. \nAnd at once, without leaving the church, thanks \nwere rendered to the Creator for His help and \nfor the victory. \n\nAnna Pavlovna's presentiment was justified, \nand all that morning a joyously festive mood \nreigned in the city. Everyone believed the vic- \ntory to have been complete, and some even \nspoke of Napoleon's having been captured, of \nhis deposition, and of the choice of a new ruler \nfor France. \n\nIt is very difficult for events to be reflected in \ntheir real strength and completeness amid the \nconditions of court life and far from the scene \nof action. General events involuntarily group \nthemselves around some particular incident. \nSo now the courtiers' pleasure was based as \nmuch on the fact that the news had arrived on \nthe Emperor's birthday as on the fact of the \nvictory itself. It was like a successfully arranged \nsurprise. Mention was made in Kutuzov's re- \nport of the Russian losses, among which fig- \nured the names of Tuchk6v, Bagrati6n, and \nKutaysov. In the Petersburg world this sad \nside of the affair again involuntarily centered \nround a single incident: Kutdysov's death. Ev- \nerybody knew him, the Emperor liked him, and \nhe was young and interesting. That day every- \none met with the words: \n\n"What a wonderful coincidence! Just during \nthe service. But what a loss Kutdysov is! How \nsorry I am!" \n\n"Whatdid I tell you about Kutiizov?" Prince \nVasfli now said with a prophet's pride. "1 al- \nways said he was the only man capable of de- \nfeating Napoleon." \n\nBut next day no news arrived from the army \nand the public mood grew anxious. The \ncourtiers suffered because of the suffering the \nsuspense occasioned the Emperor. \n\n"Fancy the Emperor's position!" said they, \nand instead of extolling Kutiizov as they had \ndone the day before, they condemned him as \nthe cause of the Emperor's anxiety. That day \nPrince Vasili no longer boasted of his protege* \nKutiizov, but remained silent when the com- \nmander in chief was mentioned. Moreover, \ntoward evening, as if everything conspired to \nmake Petersburg society anxious and uneasy, \na terrible piece of news was added. Countess \n\n\n\nHdene Beziikhova had suddenly died of that \nterrible malady it had been so agreeable to \nmention. Officially, at large gatherings, every- \none said that Countess Beziikhova had died of \na terrible attack of angina pectoris, but in in- \ntimate circles details were mentioned of how \nthe private physician of the Queen of Spain \nhad prescribed small doses of a certain drug to \nproduce a certain effect; but H61ne, tortured \nby the fact that the old count suspected her \nand that her husband to whom she had written \n(that wretched, profligate Pierre) had not re- \nplied, had suddenly taken a very large dose of \nthe drug, and had died in agony before assist- \nance could be rendered her. It was said that \nPrince Vasfli and the old count had turned \nupon the Italian, but the latter had produced \nsuch letters from the unfortunate deceased \nthat they had immediately let the matter drop. \n\nTalk in general centered round three melan- \ncholy facts: the Emperor's lack of news, the loss \nof Kutaysov, and the death of Hlne. \n\nOn the third day after Kutuzov's report a \ncountry gentleman arrived from Moscow, and \nnews of the surrender of Moscow to the French \nspread through the whole town. This was ter- \nrible! What a position for the Emperor to be \nin! Kutiizov was a traitor, and Prince Vasfli \nduring the visits of condolence paid to him \non the occasion of his daughter's death said of \nKutiizov, whom he had formerly praised (it \nwas excusable for him in his grief to forget what \nhe had said), that it was impossible to expect \nanything else from a blind and depraved old \nman. \n\n"I only wonder that the fate of Russia could \nhave been entrusted to such a man." \n\nAs long as this news remained unofficial it \nwas possible to doubt it, but the next day the \nfollowing communication was received from \nCount Rostopchin: \n\nPrince Kutiizo\ 's adjutant has brought me a let- \nter in which he demands police officers to guide \nthe army to the Ryazan road. He writes that he is \nregretfully abandoning Moscow. Sire! Kutuzov's \naction decides the fate of the capital and of your \nempire! Russia will shudder to learn of the aban- \ndonment of the city in which her greatness is cen- \ntered and in which lie the ashes of your ancestors! \nI shall follow the army. I have had everything re- \nmoved, and it only remains for me to weep over \nthe fate of my fatherland. \n\nOn receiving this dispatch the Emperor sent \nPrince Volk6nski to Kutiizov with the follow- \ning rescript: \n\nPrince Michael Ilari6novich! Since the twenty- \n\n\n\n536 \n\nninth of August I have received no communica- \ntion from you, yet on the first of September I re- \nceived from the commander in chief of Moscow, \nvia Yaroslavl, the sad news that you, with the \narmy, have decided to abandon Moscow. You can \nyourself imagine the effect this news has had on \nme, and your silence increases my astonishment. I \nam sending this by Adjutant-General Prince Vol- \nkdnski, to hear from you the situation of the army \nand the reasons that have induced you to take this \nmelancholy decision. \n\nCHAPTER III \n\nNINE DAYS after the abandonment of Moscow, \na messenger from Kutuzov reached Petersburg \nwith the official announcement of that event. \nThis messenger was Michaud, a Frenchman \nwho did not know Russian, but who was quoi- \nque Stranger, russe de cceur et d'dme* as he \nsaid of himself. \n\nThe Emperor at once received this messenger \nin his study at the palace on Stone Island. Mi- \nchaud, who had never seen Moscow before the \ncampaign and who did not know Russian, yet \nfelt deeply moved (as he wrote) when he ap- \npeared before notre trts gracieux souverain * \nwith the news of the burning of Moscow, dont \nles flammes tclairaient sa route. 3 \n\nThough the source of M. Michaud's chagrin \nmust have been different from that which \ncaused Russians to grieve, he had such a sad \nface when shown into the Emperor's study that \nthe latter at once asked: \n\n"Have you brought me sad news, Colonel?" \n\n"Very sad, sire/' replied Michaud, lowering \nhis eyes with a sigh. "The abandonment of \nMoscow." \n\n"Have they surrendered my ancient capital \nwithout a battle?" asked the Emperor quickly, \nhis face suddenly flushing. \n\nMichaud respectfully delivered the message \nKutuzov had entrusted to him, which was that \nit had been impossible to fight before Moscow, \nand that as the only remaining choice was be- \ntween losing the army as well as Moscow, or \nlosing Moscow alone, the field marshal had to \nchoose the latter. \n\nThe Emperor listened in silence, not look- \ning at Michaud. \n\n"Has the enemy entered the city?" he asked. \n\n"Yes, sire, and Moscow is now in ashes. I \nleft it all in flames," replied Michaud in a de- \ncided tone, but glancing at the Emperor he \nwas frightened by what he had done. \n\n1 Though a foreigner, Russian in heart and soul. \n\n* Our most gracious sovereign. \n\n' Whose flames illumined his route. \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\nThe Emperor began to breathe heavily and \nrapidly, his lower lip trembled, and tears in- \nstantly appeared in his fine blue eyes. \n\nBut this lasted only a moment. He suddenly \nfrowned, as if blaming himself for his weakness, \nand raising his head addressed Michaud in a \nfirm voice: \n\n"I see, Colonel, from all that is happening, \nthat Providence requires great sacrifices of us. \n... I am ready to submit myself in all things \nto His will; but tell me, Michaud, how did you \nleave the army when it saw my ancient capital \nabandoned without a battle? Did you not no- \ntice discouragement? . . ." \n\nSeeing that his most gracious ruler was calm \nonce more, Michaud also grew calm, but was \nnot immediately ready to reply to the Emper- \nor's direct and relevant question which re- \nquired a direct answer. \n\n"Sire, will you allow me to speak frankly \nas befits a loyal soldier?" he asked to gain time. \n\n"Colonel, I always require it," replied the \nEmperor. "Conceal nothing from me, I wish \nto know absolutely how things are." \n\n"Sirel" said Michaud with a subtle, scarcely \nperceptible smile on his lips, having now pre- \npared a well-phrased reply, "sire, I left the \nwhole army, from its chiefs to the lowest sol- \ndier, without exception in desperate and ago- \nnized terror . . ." \n\n"How is that?" the Emperor interrupted \nhim, frowning sternly. "Would misfortune \nmake my Russians lose heart? . . . Never!" \n\nMichaud had only waited for this to bring \nout the phrase he had prepared. \n\n"Sire," he said, with respectful playfulness, \n"they are only afraid lest Your Majesty, in the \ngoodness of your heart, should allow yourself \nto be persuaded to make peace. They are burn- \ning for the combat," declared this representa- \ntive of the Russian nation, "and to prove to \nYour Majesty by the sacrifice of their lives how \ndevoted they are " \n\n"Ah!" said the Emperor reassured, and with \na kindly gleam in his eyes, he patted Michaud \non the shoulder. "You set me at ease, Colonel." \n\nHe bent his head and was silent for some \ntime. \n\n"Well, then, go back to the army/' he said, \ndrawing himself up to his full height and ad- \ndressing Michaud with a gracious and majestic \ngesture, "and tell our brave men and all my \ngood subjects wherever you go that when I have \nnot a soldier left I shall put myself at the head \nof my beloved nobility and my good peasants \nandsouse the last resources of my empire. It still \n\n\n\noffers me more than my enemies suppose," said \nthe Emperor growing more and more ani- \nmated; "but should it ever be ordained by Di- \nvine Providence," he continued, raising to heav- \nen his fine eyes shining with emotion, "that my \ndynasty should cease to reign on the throne of \nmy ancestors, then after exhausting all the \nmeans at my command, I shall let my beard \ngrow to here" (he pointed halfway down his \nchest) "and go and eat potatoes with the mean- \nest of my peasants, rather than sign the dis- \ngrace of my country and of my beloved people \nwhose sacrifices I know how to appreciate." \n\nHaving uttered these words in an agitated \nvoice the Emperor suddenly turned away as if \nto hide from Michaud the tears that rose to his \neyes, and went to the further end of his study. \nHaving stood there a few moments, he strode \nback to Michaud and pressed his arm below \nthe elbow with a vigorous movement. The Em- \nperor's mild and handsome face was flushed \nand his eyes gleamed with resolution and an- \nger. \n\n"Colonel Michaud, do not forget what I say \nto you here, perhaps we may recall it with pleas- \nure someday . . . Napoleon or I," said the Em- \nperor, touching his breast. "We can no longer \nboth reign together. I have learned to know \nhim, and he will not deceive me any more. . . ." \n\nAnd the Emperor paused, with a frown. \n\nWhen he heard these words and saw the ex- \npression of firm resolution in the Emperor's \neyes, Michaud quoique etranger, russe de \ncceur et d'dmeat that solemn moment felt \nhimself enraptured by all that he had heard \n(as he used afterwards to say), and gave ex- \npression to his own feelings and those of the \nRussian people whose representative he con- \nsidered himself to be, in the following words: \n\n"Sirel" said he, "Your Majesty is at this mo- \nment signing the glory of the nation and the \nsalvation of Europe!" \n\nWith an inclination of the head the Emper- \nor dismissed him. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV \n\nIT is NATURAL for us who were not living in \nthose days to imagine that when half Russia \nhad been conquered and the inhabitants were \nfleeing to distant provinces, and one levy after \nanother was being raised for the defense of the \nfatherland, all Russians from the greatest to \nthe least were solely engaged in sacrificing \nthemselves, saving their fatherland, or weep- \ning over its downfall. The tales and descrip- \ntions of that time without exception speak on- \n\n\n\nBOOK TWELVE 537 \n\nly of the self-sacrifice, patriotic devotion, de- \nspair, grief, and the heroism of the Russians. \nBut it was not really so. It appears so to us be- \ncause we see only the general historic interest \nof that time and do not see all the personal \nhuman interests that people had. Yet in reality \nthose personal interests of the moment so much \ntranscend the general interests that they al- \nways prevent the public interest from being felt \nor even noticed. Most of the people at that \ntime paid no attention to the general progress \nof events but were guided only by their private \ninterests, and they were the very people whose \nactivities at that period were most useful. \n\nThose who tried to understand the general \ncourse of events and to take part in it by self- \nsacrifice and heroism were the most useless \nmembers of society, they saw everything up- \nside down, and all they did for the common \ngood turned out to be useless and foolishlike \nPierre's and Mamonov's regiments which loot- \ned Russian villages, and the lint the young \nladies prepared and that never reached the \nwounded, and so on. Even those, fond of in- \ntellectual talk and of expressing their feelings, \nwho discussed Russia's position at the time in- \nvoluntarily introduced into their conversation \neither a shade of pretense and falsehood or use- \nless condemnation and anger directed against \npeople accused of actions no one could pos- \nsibly be guilty of. In historic events the rule \nforbidding us to eat of the fruit of the Tree of \nKnowledge is specially applicable. Only un- \nconscious action bears fruit, and he who plays \na part in an historic event never understands \nits significance. If he tries to realize it his efforts \nare fruitless. \n\nThe more closely a man was engaged in the \nevents then taking place in Russia the less did \nhe realize their significance. In Petersburg and \nin the provinces at a distance from Moscow, \nladies, and gentlemen in militia uniforms, \nwept for Russia and its ancient capital and \ntalked of self-sacrifice and so on; but in the ar- \nmy which retired beyond Moscow there was \nlittle talk or thought of Moscow, and when \nthey caught sight of its burned ruins no one \nswore to be avenged on the French, but they \nthought about their next pay, their next quar- \nters, of Matreshka the vivandiere, and like \nmatters. \n\nAs the war had caught him in the service, \nNicholas Rost6v took a close and prolonged \npart in the defense of his country, but did so \ncasually, without any aim at self-sacritice, and \nhe therefore looked at what was going on in \n\n\n\n538 WAR AND PEACE \n\nRussia without despair and without dismally \nracking his brains over it. Had he been asked \nwhat he thought of the state of Russia, he \nwould have said that it was not his business to \nthink about it, that Kutuzov and others were \nthere for that purpose, but that he had heard \nthat the regiments were to be made up to their \nfull strength, that fighting would probably go \non for a long time yet, and that things being \nso it was quite likely he might be in command \nof a regiment in a couple of years' time. \n\nAs he looked at the matter in this way, he \nlearned that he was being sent to Voronezh to \nbuy remounts for his division, not only with- \nout regret at being prevented from taking part \nin the coming battle, but with the greatest \npleasure which he did not conceal and which \nhis comrades fully understood. \n\nA few days before the battle of Borodin6, \nNicholas received the necessary money and war- \nrants, and having sent some hussars on in ad- \nvance, he set out with post horses for Vor6nezh. \n\nOnly a man who has experienced it that is, \nhas passed some months continuously in an at- \nmosphere of campaigning and war can under- \nstand the delight Nicholas felt when he es- \ncaped from the region covered by the army's \nforaging operations, provision trains, and hos- \npitals. When free from soldiers, wagons, and \nthe filthy traces of a camp he saw villages with \npeasants and peasant women, gentlemen's \ncountry houses, fields where cattle were graz- \ning, posthouses with stationmasters asleep in \nthem, he rejoiced as though seeing all this for \nthe first time. What for a long while specially \nsurprised and delighted him were the women, \nyoung and healthy, without a dozen officers \nmaking up to each of them; women, too, who \nwere pleased and flattered that a passing offi- \ncer should joke with them. \n\nIn the highest spirits Nicholas arrived at \nnight at a hotel in Vor6nezh, ordered things \nhe had long been deprived of in camp, and \nnext day, very clean-shaven and in a full-dress \nuniform he had not worn for a long time, went \nto present himself to the authorities. \n\nThe commander of the militia was a civilian \ngeneral, an old man who was evidently pleased \nwith his military designation and rank. He re- \nceived Nicholas brusquely (imagining this to \nbe characteristically military) and questioned \nhim with an important air, as if considering \nthe general progress of affairs and approving \nand disapproving with full right to do so. \nNicholas was in such good spirits that this \nmerely amused him. \n\n\n\nFrom the commander of the militia he drove \nto the governor. The governor was a brisk \nlittle man, very simple and affable. He indi- \ncated the stud farms at which Nicholas might \nprocure horses, recommended to him a horse \ndealer in the town and a landowner fourteen \nmiles out of town who had the best horses, and \npromised to assist him in every way. \n\n"You are Count Ilyi Rost6v's son? My wife \nwas a great friend of your mother's. We are at \nhome on Thursdays today is Thursday, so \nplease come and see us quite informally," said \nthe governor, taking leave of him. \n\nImmediately on leaving the governor's, Nich- \nolas hired post horses and, taking his squad- \nron quartermaster with him, drove at a gallop \nto the landowner, fourteen miles away, who \nhad the stud. Everything seemed to him pleas- \nant and easy during that first part of his stay \nin Vor6nezh and, as usually happens when a \nman is in a pleasant state of mind, everything \nwent well and easily. \n\nThe landowner to whom Nicholas went was \na bachelor, an old cavalryman, a horse fancier, \na sportsman, the possessor of some century-old \nbrandy and some old Hungarian wine, who \nhad a snuggery where he smoked, and who \nowned some splendid horses. \n\nIn very few words Nicholas bought seven- \nteen picked stallions for six thousand rubles \nto serve, as he said, as samples of his remounts. \nAfter dining and taking rather too much of \nthe Hungarian wine, Nicholas having ex- \nchanged kisses with the landowner, with whom \nhe was already on the friendliest terms gal- \nloped back over abominable roads, in the \nbrightest frame of mind, continually urging \non the driver so as to be in time for the gov- \nernor's party. \n\nWhen he had changed, poured water over \nhis head, and scented himself, Nicholas arrived \nat the governor's rather late, but with the \nphrase "better late than never" on his lips. \n\nIt was not a ball, nor had dancing been an- \nnounced, but everyone knew that Catherine \nPetr6vna would play valses and the tcossaise \non the clavichord and that there would be \ndancing, and so everyone had corneas to a ball. \n\nProvincial life in 1812 went on very much \nas usual, but with this difference, that it was \nlivelier in the towns in consequence of the ar- \nrival of many wealthy families from Moscow, \nand as in everything that went on in Russia at \nthat time a special recklessness was noticeable, \nan "in for a penny, in for a poundwho cares?" \nspirit, and the inevitable small talk, instead of \n\n\n\nBOOK TWELVE \n\n\n\n5S9 \n\n\n\nturning on the weather and mutual acquaint- \nances, now turned on Moscow, the army, and \nNapoleon. \n\nThe society gathered together at the gover- \nnor's was the best in Vor6nezh. \n\nThere were a great many ladies and some of \nNicholas* Moscow acquaintances, but there \nwere no men who could at all vie with the cav- \nalier of St. George, the hussar remount officer, \nthe good-natured and well-bred Count Rost6v. \nAmong the men was an Italian prisoner, an \nofficer of the French army; and Nicholas felt that \nthe presence of that prisoner enhanced his own \nimportance as a Russian hero. The Italian was, \nas it were, a war trophy. Nicholas felt this, it \nseemed to him that everyone regarded the Ital- \nian in the same light, and he treated him cor- \ndially though with dignity and restraint. \n\nAs soon as Nicholas entered in his hussar \nuniform, diffusing around him a fragrance of \nperfume and wine, and had uttered the words \n"better late than never" and heard them re- \npeated several times by others, people clustered \naround him; all eyes turned on him, and he \nfelt at once that he had entered into his prop- \ner position in the province that of a universal \nfavorite: a very pleasant position, and intox- \nicatingly so after his long privations. At post- \ning stations, at inns, and in the landowner's \nsnuggery, maidservants had been flattered by \nhis notice, and here too at the governor's party \nthere were (as it seemed to Nicholas) an inex- \nhaustible number of pretty young women, mar- \nried and unmarried, impatiently awaiting his \nnotice. The women and girls flirted with him \nand, from the first day, the old people concerned \nthemselves to get this fine young daredevil of an \nhussar married and settled down. Among these \nwas the governor's wife herself, who welcomed \nRost6v as a near relative and called him "Nich- \nolas." \n\nCatherine Petrdvna did actually play valses \nand the tcossaise, and dancing began in which \nNicholas still further captivated the provincial \nsociety by his agility. His particularly free man- \nner of dancing even surprised them all. Nicho- \nlas was himself rather surprised at the way he \ndanced that evening. He had never danced like \nthat in Moscow and would even have consid- \nered such a very free and easy manner improp- \ner and in bad form, but here he felt it incum- \nbent on him to astonish them all by something \nunusual, something they would have to accept \nas the regular thing in the capital though new \nto them in the provinces. \n\nAll the evening Nicholas paid attention to a \n\n\n\nblue-eyed, plump and pleasing little blonde, \nthe wife of one of the provincial officials. With \nthe naive conviction of young men in a merry \nmood that other men's wives were created for \nthem, Rost6v did not leave the lady's side and \ntreated her husband in a friendly and conspira- \ntorial style, as if, without speaking of it, they \nknew how capitally Nicholas and the lady \nwould get on together. The husband, however, \ndid not seem to share that conviction and tried \nto behave morosely with Rost6v. But the lat- \nter's good-natured nai'vet was so boundless \nthat sometimes even he involuntarily yielded \nto Nicholas* good humor. Toward the end of \nthe evening, however, as the wife's face grew \nmore flushed and animated, the husband's be- \ncame more and more melancholy and solemn, \nas though there were but a given amount of \nanimation between them and as the wife's \nshare increased the husband's diminished. \n\nCHAPTER V \n\nNICHOLAS SAT leaning slightly forward in an \narmchair, bending closely over the blonde lady \nand paying her mythological compliments with \na smile that never left his face. Jauntily shift- \ning the position of his legs in their tight rid- \ning breeches, diffusing an odor of perfume, \nand admiring his partner, himself, and the fine \noutlines of his legs in their well-fitting Hessian \nboots, Nicholas told the blonde lady that he \nwished to run away with a certain lady here in \nVor6nezh. \n\n"Which lady?" \n\n"A charming lady, a divine one. Her eyes" \n(Nicholas looked at his partner) "are blue, her \nmouth coral and ivory; her figure" (he glanced \nat her shoulders) "like Diana's. . . ." \n\nThe husband came up and sullenly asked his \nwife what she was talking about. \n\n"Ah, Nikita Ivzhiych!" cried Nicholas, rising \npolitely, and as if wishing Nikita Ivnych to \nshare his joke, he began to tell him of his in- \ntention to elope with a blonde lady. \n\nThe husband smiled gloomily, the wife gaily. \nThe governor's good-natured wife came up \nwith a look of disapproval. \n\n"Anna Ignityevna wants to see you, Nicho- \nlas," said she, pronouncing the name so that \nNicholas at once understood that Anna Ignat- \nyevna was a very important person. "Come, \nNicholasl You know you let me call you so?" \n\n"Oh, yes, Aunt. Who is she?" \n\n"Anna Igndtyevna Malvintseva. She has \nheard from her niece how you rescued her. . . . \nCan you guess?" \n\n\n\n540 \n\n"I rescued such a lot of them!" said Nic^io- \nlas. \n\n"Her niece, Princess Bolk6nskaya. She is here \nin Vor6nezh with her aunt. Oho! How you \nblush. Why, are . . . ?" \n\n"Not a bit! Please don't, Aunt!" \n\n"Very well, very well! . . . Oh, what a fellow \nyou are!" \n\nThe governor's wife led him up to a tall and \nvery stout old lady with a blue headdress, who \nhad just finished her game of cards with the \nmost important personages of the town. This \nwas Malvintseva, Princess Mary's aunt on her \nmother's side, a rich, childless widow who al- \nways lived in Voronezh. When Rost6v ap- \nproached her she was standing settling up for \nthe game. She looked at him and, screwing up \nher eyes sternly, continued to upbraid the gen- \neral who had won from her. \n\n"Very pleased, mon cher" she then said, \nholding out her hand to Nicholas. "Pray come \nand see me." \n\nAfter a few words about Princess Mary and \nher late father, whom Malvintseva had evident- \nly not liked, and having asked what Nicholas \nknew of Prince Andrew, who also was evident- \nly no favorite of hers, the important old lady \ndismissed Nicholas after repeating her invita- \ntion to come to see her. \n\nNicholas promised to come and blushed \nagain as he bowed. At the mention of Princess \nMary he experienced a feeling of shyness and \neven of fear, which he himself did not under- \nstand. \n\nWhen he had parted from Malvintseva Nich- \nolas wished to return to the dancing, but the \ngovernor's little wife placed her plump hand \non his sleeve and, saying that she wanted to \nhave a talk with him, led him to her sitting \nroom, from which those who were there imme- \ndiately withdrew so as not to be in her way. \n\n"Do you know, dear boy," began the gov- \nernor's wife with a serious expression on her \nkind little face, "that really would be the match \nfor you: would you like me to arrange it?" \n\n"Whom do you mean, Aunt?" asked Nicho- \nlas. \n\n"I will make a match for you with the prin- \ncess. Catherine Petr6vna speaks of Lily, but I \nsay, no the princess! Do you want me to do it? \nI am sure your mother will be grateful to me. \nWhat a charming girl she is, really! And she \nis not at all so plain, either." \n\n"Not at all," replied Nicholas as if offended \nat the idea. "As befits a soldier, Aunt, I don't \nforce myself on anyone or refuse anything," he \n\n\n\nAND PEACE \n\nsaid before he had time to consider what he \nwas saying. \n\n"Well then, remember, this is not a joke!" \n\n"Of course not!" \n\n"Yes, yes," the governor's wife said as if talk- \ning to herself. "But, my dear boy, among oth- \ner things you are too attentive to the other, \nthe blonde. One is sorry for the husband, \nreally. . . ." \n\n"Oh no, we are good friends with him," said \nNicholas in the simplicity of his heart; it did \nnot enter his head that a pastime so pleasant \nto himself might not be pleasant to someone \nelse. \n\n"But what nonsense 1 have been saying to \nthe governor's wife!" thought Nicholas sud- \ndenly at supper. "She will really begin to ar- \nrange a match . . . and Sonya . . . ?" And on \ntaking leave of the governor's wife, when she \nagain smilingly said to him, "Well then, re- \nmember!" he drew her aside. \n\n"But see here, to tell you the truth, Aunt . . ." \n\n"What is it, my dear? Come, let's sit down \nhere," said she. \n\nNicholas suddenly felt a desire and need to \ntell his most intimate thoughts (which he \nwould not have told to his mother, his sister, \nor his friend) to this woman who was almost a \nstranger. When he afterwards recalled that im- \npulse to unsolicited and inexplicable frankness \nwhich had very important results for him, it \nseemed to him as it seems to everyone in such \ncases that it was merely some silly whim that \nseized him: yet that burst of frankness, to- \ngether with other trifling events, had immense \nconsequences for him and for all his family. \n\n"You see, Aunt, Mamma has long wanted \nme to marry an heiress, but the very idea of \nmarrying for money is repugnant to me." \n\n"Oh yes, I understand," said the governor's \nwife. \n\n"But Princess Bolk6nskaya that's another \nmatter. I will tell you the truth. In the first \nplace I like her very much, I feel drawn to her; \nand then, after I met her under such circum- \nstancesso strangely, the idea of ten occurred to \nme: 'This is fate.' Especially if you remember \nthat Mamma had long been thinking of it; but \nI had never happened to meet her before, some- \nhow it had always happened that we did not \nmeet. And as long as my sister Natasha was en- \ngaged to her brother it was of course out of \nthe question for me to think of marrying her. \nAnd it must needs happen that I should meet \nher just when Natdsha's engagement had been \nbroken off ... and then everything , , . So you \n\n\n\nBOOK TWELVE \n\n\n\nsee ... I never told this to anyone and never \nwill, only to you." \n\nThe governor's wife pressed his elbow grate- \nfully. \n\n"You know S6nya, my cousin? I love her, and \npromised to marry her, and will do so. ... So \nyou see there can be no question about" said \nNicholas incoherently and blushing. \n\n"My dear boy, what a way to look at it! You \nknow S6nya has nothing and you yourself say \nyour Papa's affairs are in a very bad way. And \nwhat about your mother? It would kill her, \nthat's one thing. And what sort of life would \nit be for S6nya if she's a girl with a heart? \nYour mother in despair, and you all ruined. . . . \nNo, my dear, you and S6nya ought to under- \nstand that." \n\nNicholas remained silent. It comforted him \nto hear these arguments. \n\n"All the same, Aunt, it is impossible," he re- \njoined with a sigh, after a short pause. "Be- \nsides, would the princess have me? And besides, \nshe is now in mourning. How can one think of \nit!" \n\n"But you don't suppose I'm going to get you \nmarried at once? There is always a right way \nof doing things," replied the governor's wife. \n\n"What a matchmaker you are, Aunt . . ." said \nNicholas, kissing her plump little hand. \n\nCHAPTER VI \n\nON REACHING Moscow after her meeting with \nRost6v, Princess Mary had found her nephew \nthere with his tutor, and a letter from Prince \nAndrew giving her instructions how to get to \nher Aunt Malvfntseva at Vor6nezh. That feel- \ning akin to temptation which had tormented \nher during her father's illness, since his death, \nand especially since her meeting with Rost6v \nwas smothered by arrangements for the jour- \nney, anxiety about her brother, settling in a \nnew house, meeting new people, and attend- \ning to her nephew's education. She was sad. \nNow, after a month passed in quiet sur- \nroundings, she felt more and more deeply the \nloss of her father which was associated in her \nmind with the ruin of Russia. She was agitat- \ned and incessantly tortured by the thought of \nthe dangers to which her brother, the only in- \ntimate person now remaining to her, was ex- \nposed. She was worried too about her nephew's \neducation for which she had always felt her- \nself incompetent, but in the depths of her soul \nshe felt at peace a peace arising from con- \nsciousness of having stifled those personal \ndreams and hopes that had been on the point \n\n\n\nof awakening within her and were related to \nher meeting with Rost6v. \n\nThe day after her party the governor's wife \ncame to see Malvintseva and, after discussing \nher plan with the aunt, remarked that though \nunder present circumstances a formal betroth- \nal was, of course, not to be thought of, all the \nsame the young people might be brought to- \ngether and could get to know one another. \nMalvintseva expressed approval, and the gov- \nernor's wife began to speakof Rost6vin Mary's \npresence, praising him and telling how he had \nblushed when Princess Mary's name was men- \ntioned. But Princess Mary experienced a pain- \nful rather than a joyful feeling her mental \ntranquillity was destroyed, and desires, doubts, \nself-reproach, and hopes reawoke. \n\nDuring the two days that elapsed before Ros- \nt6v called, Princess Mary continually thought \nof how she ought to behave to him. First she \ndecided not to come to the drawing room when \nhe called to see her aunt that it would not be \nproper for her, in her deep mourning, to re- \nceive visitors; then she thought this would be \nrude after what he had done for her; then it \noccurred to her that her aunt and the gover- \nnor's wife had intentions concerning herself \nand Rost6v their looks and words at times \nseemed to confirm this supposition then she \ntold herself tnat only she, with her sinful na- \nture, could think this of them: they could not \nforget that situated as she was, while still wear- \ning deep mourning, such matchmaking would \nbe an insult to her and to her father's memory. \nAssuming that she did go down to see him, \nPrincess Mary imagined the words he would \nsay to her and what she would say to him, and \nthese words sometimes seemed undeservedly \ncold and then to mean too much. More than \nanything she feared lest the confusion she felt \nmight overwhelm her and betray her as soon \nas she saw him. \n\nBut when on Sunday after church the foot- \nman announced in the drawing room that \nCount Rostov had called, the princess showed \nno confusion, only a slight blush suffused her \ncheeks and her eyes lit up with a new and ra- \ndiant light. \n\n"You have met him, Aunt?" said she in a \ncalm voice, unable herself to understand that \nshe could be outwardly so calm and natural. \n\nWhen Rost6v entered the room, the princess \ndropped her eyes for an instant, as if to give \nthe visitor time to greet her aunt, and then just \nas Nicholas turned to her she raised her head \nand met his Iqpk with shining eyes. With a \n\n\n\n54* \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nmovement full of dignity and grace she half \nrose with a smile of pleasure, held out her slen- \nder, delicate hand to him, and began to speak \nin a voice in which for the first time new deep \nwomanly notes vibrated. Mademoiselle Bouri- \nenne, who was in the drawing room, looked at \nPrincess Mary in bewildered surprise. Herself \na consummate coquette, she could not have \nmaneuvered better on meeting a man she \nwished to attract. \n\n"Either black is particularly becoming to \nher or she really has greatly improved without \nmy having noticed it. And above all, what tact \nand grace!" thought Mademoiselle Bourienne. \n\nHad Princess Mary been capableof reflection \nat that moment, she would have been more \nsurprised than Mademoiselle Bourienne at the \nchange that had taken place in herself. From \nthe moment she recognized that dear, loved \nface, a new life force took possession of her \nand compelled her to speak and act apart from \nher own will. From the time Rostov entered, \nher face became suddenly transformed. It was \nas if a light had been kindled in a carved and \npainted lantern and the intricate, skillful, ar- \ntistic work on its sides, that previously seemed \ndark, coarse, and meaningless, was suddenly \nshown up in unexpected and striking beauty. \nFor the first time all that pure, spiritual, in- \nward travail through which she had lived ap- \npeared on the surface. All her inward labor, \nher dissatisfaction with herself, her sufferings, \nher strivings after goodness, her meekness, love, \nand self-sacrifice all this now shone in those \nradiant eyes, in her delicate smile, and in ev- \nery trait of her gentle face. \n\nRost6v saw all this as clearly as if he had \nknown her whole life. He felt that the being \nbefore him was quite different from, and bet- \nter than, anyone he had met before, and above \nall better than himself. \n\nTheir conversation was very simple and un- \nimportant. They spoke of the war, and like \neveryone else unconsciously exaggerated their \nsorrow about it; they spoke of their last meet- \ningNicholas trying to change the subject \nthey talked of the governor's kind wife, of Nich- \nolas' relations, and of Princess Mary's. \n\nShe did not talk about her brother, divert- \ning the conversation as soon as her aunt men- \ntioned Andrew. Evidently she could speak of \nRussia's misfortunes with a certain artificiality, \nbut her brother was too near her heart and she \nneither could nor would speak lightly of him. \nNicholas noticed this, as he noticed every \nshade of Princess Mary's character with an ob- \n\n\n\nservation unusual to him, and everything con- \nfirmed his conviction that she was a quite un- \nusual and extraordinary being. Nicholas \nblushed and was confused when people spoke \nto him about the princess (as she did when he \nwas mentioned) and even when he thought of \nher, but in her presence he felt quite at ease, \nand said not at all what he had prepared, but \nwhat, quite appropriately, occurred to him at \nthe moment. \n\nWhen a pause occurred during his short \nvist, Nicholas, as is usual when there are chil- \ndren, turned to Prince Andrew's little son, ca- \nressing him and asking whether he would like \nto be an hussar. He took the boy on his knee, \nplayed with him, and looked round at Princess \nMary. With a softened, happy, and timid look \nshe watched the boy she loved in the arms of \nthe man she loved. Nicholas also noticed that \nlook and, as if understanding it, flushed with \npleasure and began to kiss the boy with good- \nnatured playfulness. \n\nAs she was in mourning Princess Mary did \nnot go out into society, and Nicholas did not \nthink it the proper thing to visit her again; but \nall the same the governor's wife went on with \nher matchmaking, passing on to Nicholas the \nflattering things Princess Mary said of him and \nvice versa, and insisting on his declaring him- \nself to Princess Mary. For this purpose she ar- \nranged a meeting between the young people at \nthe bishop's house before Mass. \n\nThough Rostov told the governor's wife that \nhe would not make any declaration to Princess \nMary, he promised to go. \n\nAs at Tilsit Rostov had not allowed himself \nto doubt that what everybody considered right \nwas right, so now, after a short but sincere strug- \ngle between his effort to arrange his life by his \nown sense of justice, and in obedient submis- \nsion to circumstances, he chose the latter and \nyielded to the power he felt irresistibly carry- \ning him he knew not where. He knew that aft- \ner his promise to S6nya it would be what he \ndeemed base to declare his feelings to Princess \nMary. And he knew that he would never act \nbasely. But he also knew (or rather felt at the \nbottom of his heart) that by resigning himself \nnow to the force of circumstances and to those \nwho were guiding him, he was not only doing \nnothing wrong, but was doing something very \nvery important more important than anything \nhe had ever done in his life. \n\nAfter meeting Princess Mary, though the \ncourse of his life went on externally as before, \nall his former amusements lost their charm for \n\n\n\nBOOK TWELVE \n\nlim and he often thought about her. But he \nlever thought about her as he had thought of \nill the young ladies without exception whom \nhe had met in society, nor as he had for a long \n.ime, and at one time rapturously, thought \nibout S6nya. He had pictured each of those \nroung ladies as almost all honest-hearted young \nmen do, that is, as a possible wife, adapting \nher in his imagination to all the conditions of \nmarried life: a white dressing gown, his wife \nit the tea table, his wife's carriage, little ones, \nMamma and Papa, their relations to her, and \no on and these pictures of the future had giv- \nzn him pleasure. But with Princess Mary, to \nwhom they were trying to get him engaged, he \ncould never picture anything of future mar- \nried life. If he tried, his pictures seemed in- \ncongruous and false. It made him afraid. \n\n\n\n543 \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII \n\nTHE DREADFUL NEWS of the battle of Borodino, \nof our losses in killed and wounded, and the \nstill more terrible news of the loss of Moscow \nreached Voronezh in the middle of September. \nPrincess Mary, having learned of her brother's \nwound only from the Gazette and having no \ndefinite news of him, prepared (so Nicholas \nbeard, he had not seen her again himself) to set \noff in search of Prince Andrew. \n\nWhen he received the news of the battle of \nBorodin6 and the abandonment of Moscow, \nRost6v was not seized with despair, anger, the \ndesire for vengeance, or any feeling of that \nkind, but everything in Vor6nezh suddenly \nseemed to him dull and tiresome, and he ex- \nperienced an indefinite feeling of shame and \nawkwardness. The conversations he heard \nseemed to him insincere; he did not know how \nto judge all these affairs and felt that only in \nthe regiment would everything again become \nclear to him. He made haste to finish buying \nthe horses, and often became unreasonably an- \ngry with his servant and squadron quartermas- \nter. \n\nA few days before his departure a special \nthanksgiving, at which Nicholas was present, \nwas held in the cathedral for the Russian vic- \ntory. He stood a little behind the governor and \nheld himself with military decorum through \nthe service, meditating on a great variety of \nsubjects. When the service was over the gov- \nernor's wife beckoned him to her. \n\n"Have you seen the princess?" she asked, \nindicating with a movement of her head a lady \nstanding on the opposite side, beyond the \nchoir. \n\n\n\nNicholas immediately recognized Princess \nMary not so much by the profile he saw under \nher bonnet as by the feeling of solicitude, ti- \nmidity, and pity that immediately overcame \nhim. Princess Mary, evidently engrossed by her \nthoughts, was crossing herself for the last time \nbefore leaving the church. \n\nNicholas looked at her face with surprise. It \nwas the same face he had seen before, there \nwas the same general expression of refined, in- \nner, spiritual labor, but now it was quite dif- \nferently lit up. There was a pathetic expres- \nsion of sorrow, prayer, and hope in it. As had \noccurred before when she was present, Nicho- \nlas went up to her without waiting to be \nprompted by the governor's wife and not ask- \ning himself whether or not it was right and \nproper to address her here in church, and told \nher he had heard of her trouble and sympa- \nthized with his whole soul. As soon as she heard \nhis voice a vivid glow kindled in her face, light- \ning up both her sorrow and her joy. \n\n"There is one thing I wanted to tell you, \nPrincess," said Rostov. "It is that if your broth- \ner, Prince Andrew Nikolaevich, were not living, \nit would have been at once announced in the \nGazette, as he is a colonel." \n\nThe princess looked at him, not grasping \nwhat he was saying, but cheered by the expres- \nsion of regretful sympathy on his face. \n\n"And I have known so many cases of a splin- \nter wound" (the Gazette said it was a shell) \n"either proving fatal at once or being very \nslight," continued Nicholas. "We must hope \nfor the best, and I am sure ..." \n\nPrincess Mary interrupted him. \n\n"Oh, that would be so dread . . ." she began \nand, prevented by agitation from finishing, she \nbent her head with a movement as graceful as \neverything she did in his presence and, look- \ning up at him gratefully, went out, following \nher aunt. \n\nThat evening Nicholas did not go out, but \nstayed at home to settle some accounts with \nthe horse dealers. When he had finished that \nbusiness it was already too late to go anywhere \nbut still too early to go to bed, and for a long \ntime he paced up and down the room, reflect- \ning on his life, a thing he rarely did. \n\nPrincess Mary had made an agreeable im- \npression on him when he had met her in Smo- \n16nsk province. His having encountered her \nin such exceptional circumstances, and his \nmother having at one time mentioned her to \nhim as a good match, had drawn his particular \nattention to her. When he met her again in \n\n\n\n544 \n\nVor6nezh the impression she made on him was \nnot merely pleasing but powerful. Nicholas \nhad been struck by the peculiar moral beauty \nhe observed in her at this time. He was, how- \never, preparing to go away and it had not en- \ntered his head to regret that he was thus de- \npriving himself of chances of meeting her. But \nthat day's encounter in church had, he felt, \nsunk deeper than was desirable for his peace \nof mind. That pale, sad, refined face, that radi- \nant look, those gentle graceful gestures, and \nespecially the deep and tender sorrow expressed \nin all her features agitated him and evoked his \nsympathy. In men Rost6v could not bear to see \nthe expression of a higher spiritual life (that \nwas why he did not like Prince Andrew) and \nhe referred to it contemptuously as philosophy \nand dreaminess, but in Princess Mary that very \nsorrow which revealed the depth of a whole \nspiritual world foreign to him was an irresist- \nible attraction. \n\n"She must be a wonderful woman. A real \nangel!" he said to himself. "Why am I not \nfree? Why was I in such a hurry with S6nya?" \nAnd he involuntarily compared the two: the \nlack of spirituality in the one and the abun- \ndance of it in the other a spirituality he him- \nself lacked and therefore valued most highly. \nHe tried to picture what would happen were \nhe free. How he would propose to her and how \nshe would become his wife. But no, he could \nnot imagine that. He felt awed, and no clear \npicture presented itself to his mind. He had \nlong ago pictured to himself a future with S6n- \nya, and that was all clear and simple just be- \ncause it had all been thought out and he knew \nall there was in S6nya, but it was impossible to \npicture a future with Princess Mary, because \nhe did not understand her but simply loved \nher. \n\nReveries about S6nya had had something \nmerry and playful in them, but to dream of \nPrincess Mary was always difficult and a little \nfrightening. \n\n"How she prayed!" he thought. "It was plain \nthat her whole soul was in her prayer. Yes, that \nwas the prayer that moves mountains, and I \nam sure her prayer will be answered. Why \ndon't I pray for what I want?" he suddenly \nthought. "What do I want? To be free, released \nfrom S6nya . . . She was right," he thought, re- \nmembering what the governor's wife had said: \n"Nothing but misfortune can come of marry- \ning S6nya. Muddles, grief for Mamma . . . busi- \nness difficulties . . . muddles, terrible muddles! \nBesides, I don't love her not as I should. O, \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\nGod! release me from this dreadful, inextric- \nable position!" he suddenly began to pray. \n"Yes, prayer can move mountains, but one \nmust have faith and not pray as Natdsha and I \nused to as children, that the snow might turn \ninto sugar and then run out into the yard \nto see whether it had done so. No, but I am not \npraying for trifles now," he thought as he put \nhis pipe down in a corner, and folding his \nhands placed himself before the icon. Softened \nby memories of Princess Mary he began to pray \nas he had not done for a long time. Tears were \nin his eyes and in his throat when the door \nopened and Lavnishka came in with some \npapers. \n\n"Blockhead! Why do you come in without \nbeing called?" cried Nicholas, quickly chang- \ning his attitude. \n\n"From the governor," said Lavrushka in a \nsleepy voice. "A courier has arrived and there's \na letter for you." \n\n"Well, all right, thanks. You can go!" \n\nNicholas took the two letters, one of which \nwas from his mother and the other from S6n- \nya. He recognized them by the handwriting \nand opened S6nya's first. He had read only a \nfew lines when he turned pale and his eyes \nopened wide with fear and joy. \n\n"No, it's not possible!" he cried aloud. \n\nUnable to sit still he paced up and down the \nroom holding the letter and reading it. He \nglanced through it, then read it again, and \nthen again, and standing still in the middle \nof the room he raised his shoulders, stretching \nout his hands, with his mouth wide open and \nhis eyes fixed. What he had just been pray- \ning for with confidence that God would hear \nhim had come to pass; but Nicholas was as \nmuch astonished as if it were something ex- \ntraordinary and unexpected, and as if the \nvery fact that it had happened so quickly \nproved that it had not come from God to \nwhom he fyad prayed, but by some ordinary \ncoincidence. \n\nThis unexpected and, as it seemed to Nich- \nolas, quite voluntary letter from S6nya freed \nhim from the knot that fettered him and from \nwhich there had seemed no escape. She wrote \nthat the last unfortunate events the loss of al- \nmost the whole of the Rost6vs' Moscow prop- \nertyand the countess* repeatedly expressed \nwish that Nicholas should marry Princess Bol- \nk6nskaya, together with his silence and cold- \nness of late, had all combined to make her de- \ncide to release him from his promise and set \nhim completely free. \n\n\n\nBOOK TWELVE \n\n\n\n545 \n\n\n\nIt would be too painful to me to think that I \nnight be a cause of sorrow or discord in the fam- \nly that has been so good to me (she wrote), and \nny love has no aim but the happiness of those I \nove; so, Nicholas, I beg you to consider yourself \nr rce, and to be assured that, in spite of everything, \n10 one can love you more than does \n\nYOUR SONYA \n\nBoth letters were written from Tr6itsa. The \n:&gt;ther, from the countess, described their last \niays in Moscow, their departure, the fire, and \nthe destruction of all their property. In this \nletter the countess also mentioned that Prince \n\ndrew was among the wounded traveling \nivith them; his state was very critical, but the \n:ioctor said there was now more hope. S6nya \nmd Natasha were nursing him. \n\nNext day Nicholas took his mother's letter \nind went to see Princess Mary. Neither he nor \n&gt;he said a word about what "Natasha nursing \nhim" might mean, but thanks to this letter \nNicholas suddenly became almost as intimate \nwith the princess as if they were relations. \n\nThe following day he saw Princess Mary off \nan her journey to Yaroslavl, and a few days \nlater left to rejoin his regiment. \n\nCHAPTER VIII \n\nSONYA'S LETTKR written from Tr6itsa, which \nhad come as an answer to Nicholas* prayer, was \nprompted by this: the thought of getting Nich- \nolas married to an heiress occupied the old \ncountess' mind more and more. She knew that \n&gt;6nya was the chief obstacle to this happening, \nand Sonya's life in the countess' house had \nEpown harder and harder, especially after they \nhad received a letter from Nicholas telling of \nhis meeting with Princess Mary in Bogucharo- \nvo. The countess let no occasion slip of mak- \ning humiliating or cruel allusions to Sonya. \n\nBut a few days before they left Moscow, \nmoved and excited by all that was going on, \nshe called S6nya to her and, instead of re- \nproaching and making demands on her, tear- \nfully implored her to sacrifice herself and re- \npay all that the family had done for her by \nbreaking off her engagement with Nicholas. \n\n"I shall not be at peace till you promise me \nthis." \n\nS6nya burst into hysterical tears and replied \nthrough her sobs that she would do anything \nand was prepared for anything, but gave no \nactual promise and could not bring herself to \ndecide to do what was demanded of her. She \nmust sacrifice herself for the family that had \nreared and brought her up. To sacrifice her- \n\n\n\nself for others was Sonya's habit. Her position \nin the house was such that only by sacrifice \ncould she show her worth, and she was accus- \ntomed to this and loved doing it. But in all her \nformer acts of self-sacrifice she had been hap- \npily conscious that they raised her in her own \nesteem and in that of others, and so made her \nmore worthy of Nicholas whom she loved more \nthan anything in the world. But now they \nwanted her to sacrifice the very thing that con- \nstituted the whole reward for her self-sacrifice \nand the whole meaning of her life. And for the \nfirst time she felt bitterness against those who \nhad been her benefactors only to torture her \nthe more painfully; she felt jealous of Natasha \nwho had never experienced anything of this \nsort, had never needed to sacrifice herself, but \nmade others sacrifice themselves for her and \nyet was beloved by everybody. And for the first \ntime S6nya felt that out of her pure, quiet love \nfor Nicholas a passionate feeling was begin- \nning to grow up which was stronger than prin- \nciple, virtue, or religion. Under the influence \nof this feeling S6nya, whose life of dependence \nhad taught her involuntarily to be secretive, \nhaving answered the countess in vague general \nterms, avoided talking with her and resolved \nto wait till she should see Nicholas, not in or- \nder to set him free but on the contrary at that \nmeeting to bind him to her forever. \n\nThe bustle and terror of the Rostovs' last \ndays in Moscow stifled the gloomy thoughts \nthat oppressed Sonya. She was glad to find es- \ncape from them in practical activity. But when \nshe heard of Prince Andrew's presence in their \nhouse, despite her sincere pity for him and for \nNatdsha, she was seized by a joyful and super- \nstitious feeling that God did not intend her to \nbe separated from Nicholas. She knew that \nNatasha loved no one but Prince Andrew and \nhad never ceased to love him. She knew that \nbeing thrown together again under such ter- \nrible circumstances they would again fall in \nlove with one another, and that Nicholas would \nthen not be able to marry Princess Mary as \nthey would be within the prohibited degrees \nof affinity. Despite all the terror of what had \nhappened during those last days and during \nthe first days of their journey, this feeling that \nProvidence was intervening in her personal \naffairs cheered Sonya. \n\nAt the Tr6itsa monastery the Rost6vs first \nbroke their journey for a whole day. \n\nThree large rooms were assigned to them in \nthe monastery hostelry, one of which was oc- \ncupied by Prince Andrew. The wounded man \n\n\n\n546 WAR AND PEACE \n\nwas much better that day and Natdsha was sit- \nting with him. In the next room sat the count \nand countess respectfully conversing with the \nprior, who was calling on them as old acquaint- \nances and benefactors of the monastery. S6n- \nya was there too, tormented by curiosity as to \nwhat Prince Andrew and Natasha were talking \nabout. She heard the sound of their voices \nthrough the door. That door opened and Na- \ntdsha came out, looking excited. Not noticing \nthe monk, who had risen to greet her and was \ndrawing back the wide sleeve on his right arm, \nshe went up to S6nya and took her hand. \n\n"Natdsha, what are you about? Come here!" \nsaid the countess. \n\nNatdsha went up to the monk for his bless- \ning, and he advised her to turn for aid to God \nand His saint. \n\nAs soon as the prior withdrew, Natdsha took \nher friend by the hand and went with her into \nthe unoccupied room. \n\n"S6nya, will he live?" she asked. "S6nya, \nhow happy I am, and how unhappy! . . . S6n- \nya, dovey, everything is as it used to be. If only \nhe lives! He cannot . . . because . . . because . . . \nof . . ." and Natdsha burst into tears. \n\n"Yes! I knew it! Thank God!" murmured \nS6nya. "He will live." \n\nSonya was not less agitated than her friend \nby the latter's fear and grief and by her own \npersonal feelings which she shared with no \none. Sobbing, she kissed and comforted Natd- \nsha. "If only he lives!" she thought. Having \nwept, talked, and wiped away their tears, the \ntwo friends went together to Prince Andrew's \ndoor. Natdsha opened it cautiously and glanced \ninto the room, S6nya standing beside her at \nthe half-open door. \n\nPrince Andrew was lying raised high on \nthree pillows. His pale face was calm, his eyes \nclosed, and they could see his regular breath- \ning. \n\n"O, Natdsha!" S6nya suddenly almost \nscreamed, catching her companion's arm and \nstepping back from the door. \n\n"What? What is it?" asked Natdsha. \n\n"It's that, that . . ." said S6nya, with a white \nface and trembling lips. \n\nNatdsha softly closed the door and went with \nSonya to the window, not yet understanding \nwhat the latter was telling her. \n\n"You remember," said S6nya with a solemn \nand frightened expression. "You remember \nwhen I looked in the mirror for you ... at \nOtrddnoe at Christinas? Do you remember \nwhat I saw?" \n\n\n\n"Yes, yes!" cried Natdsha opening her eyes \nwide, and vaguely recalling that S6nya had \ntold her something about Prince Andrew \nwhom she had seen lying down. \n\n"You remember?" S6nya went on. "I saw \nit then and told everybody, you and Dunydsha. \nI saw him lying on a bed," said she, making a \ngesture with her hand and a lifted finger at \neach detail, "and that he had his eyes closed \nand was covered just with a pink quilt,, and \nthat his hands were folded," she concluded, \nconvincing herself that the details she had just \nseen were exactly what she had seen in the \nmirror. \n\nShe had in fact seen nothing then but had \nmentioned the first thing that came into her \nhead, but what she had invented then seemed \nto her now as real as any other recollection. \nShe not only remembered what she had then \nsaidthat he turned to look at her and smiled \nand was covered with something red but was \nfirmly convinced that she had then seen and \nsaid that he was covered with a pink quilt and \nthat his eyes were closed. \n\n"Yes, yes, it really was pink!" cried Natdsha, \nwho now thought she too remembered the \nword pink being used, and saw in this the \nmost extraordinary and mysterious part of the \nprediction. \n\n"But what does it mean?" she added medita- \ntively. \n\n"Oh, I don't know, it is all so strange," re- \nplied S6nya, clutching at her head. \n\nA few minutes later Prince Andrew rang \nand Natdsha went to him, but S6nya, feeling \nunusually excited and touched, remained at \nthe window thinking about the strangeness of \nwhat had occurred. \n\n\n\nThey had an opportunity that day to send \nletters to the army, and the countess was writ- \ning to her son. \n\n"S6nyal" said the countess, raising her eyes \nfrom her letter as her niece passed, "S6nya, \nwon't you write to Nicholas?" She spoke in a \nsoft, tremulous voice, and in the weary eyes \nthat looked over her spectacles S6nya read all \nthat the countess meant to convey with these \nwords. Those eyes expressed entreaty, shame \nat having to ask, fear of a refusal, and readi- \nness for relentless hatred in case of such refusal. \n\nS6nya went up to the countess and, kneeling \ndown, kissed her hand. \n\n"Yes, Mamma, I will write," said she. \n\nS6nya was softened, excited, and touched by \nall that had occurred that day, especially by \n\n\n\nBOOK TWELVE \n\nthe mysterious fulfillment she had just seen of \nher vision. Now that she knew that the renewal \nof Natdsha's relations with Prince Andrew \nwould prevent Nicholas from marrying Prin- \ncess Mary, she was joyfully conscious of a re- \nturn of that self-sacrificing spirit in which she \nwas accustomed to live and loved to live. So \nwith a joyful consciousness of performing a \nmagnanimous deedinterrupted several times \nby the tears that dimmed her velvety black \neyes she wrote that touching letter the arrival \nof which had so amazed Nicholas. \n\n\n\n547 \n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX \n\nTHE OFFICER AND SOLDIERS who had arrested \nPierre treated him with hostility but yet with \nrespect, in the guardhouse to which he was \ntaken. In their attitude toward him could still \nbe felt both uncertainty as to who he might be \nperhaps a very important person and hostil- \nity as a result of their recent personal conflict \nwith him. \n\nBut when the guard was relieved next morn- \ning, Pierre felt that for the new guard both \nofficers and men he was not as interesting as \nhe had been to his captors; and in fact the \nguard of the second day did not recognize in \nthis big, stout man in a peasant coat the vigor- \nous person who had fought so desperately with \nthe marauder and the convoy and had uttered \nthose solemn words about saving a child; they \nsaw in him only No. 17 of the captured Rus- \nsians, arrested and detained for some reason \nby order of the Higher Command. If they \nnoticed anything remarkable about Pierre, it \nwas only his unabashed, meditative concentra- \ntion and thoughtfulness, and the way he spoke \nFrench, which struck them as surprisingly \ngood. In spite of this he was placed that day \nwith the other arrested suspects, as the sepa- \nrate room he had occupied was required by an \nofficer. \n\nAll the Russians confined with Pierre were \nmen of the lowest class and, recognizing him \nas a gentleman, they all avoided him, more es- \npecially as he spoke French. Pierre felt sad at \nhearing them making fun of him. \n\nThat evening he learned that all these pris- \noners (he, probably, among them) were to be \ntried for incendiarism. On the third day he \nwas taken with the others to a house where a \nFrench general with a white mustache sat with \ntwo colonels and other Frenchmen with scarves \non their arms. With the precision and definite- \nness customary in addressing prisoners, and \nwhich is supposed to preclude human frailty, \n\n\n\nPierre like the others was questioned as to who \nhe was, where he had been, with what object, \nand so on. \n\nThese questions, like questions put at trials \ngenerally, left the essence of the matter aside, \nshut out the possibility of that essence's being \nrevealed, and were designed only to form a \nchannel through which the judges wished the \nanswers of the accused to flow so as to lead to \nthe desired result, namely a conviction. As \nsoon as Pierre began to say anything that did \nnot fit in with that aim, the channel was re- \nmoved and the water could flow to waste. Pierre \nfelt, moreover, what the accused always feel at \ntheir trial, perplexity as to why these questions \nwere put to him. He had a feeling that it was \nonly out of condescension or a kind of civility \nthat this device of placing a channel was em- \nployed. He knew he was in these men's power, \nthat only by force had they brought him there, \nthat force alone gave them the right to de- \nmand answers to their questions, and that the \nsole object of that assembly was to inculpate \nhim. And so, as they had the power and wish \nto inculpate him, this expedient of an inquiry \nand trial seemed unnecessary. It was evident \nthat any answer would lead to conviction. \nWhen asked what he was doing when he was \narrested, Pierre replied in a rather tragic man- \nner that he was restoring to its parents a child \nhe had saved from the flames. Why had he \nfought the marauder? Pierre answered that he \n"was protecting a woman," and that "to pro- \ntect a woman who was being insulted was the \nduty of every man; that . . ." They interrupted \nhim, for this was not to the point. Why was he \nin the yard of a burning house where witnesses \nhad seen him? He replied that he had gone \nout to see what was happening in Moscow. \nAgain they interrupted him: they had not \nasked where he was going, but why he was \nfound near the fire? Who was he? they asked, \nrepeating their first question, which he had de- \nclined to answer. Again he replied that he \ncould not answer it. \n\n"Put that down, that's bad . . . very bad/' \nsternly remarked the general with the white \nmustache and red flushed face. \n\nOn the fourth day fires broke out on the \nZiibovski rampart. \n\nPierre and thirteen others were moved to \nthe coach house of a merchant's house near \nthe Crimean bridge. On his way through the \nstreets Pierre felt stifled by the smoke which \nseemed to hang over the whole city. Fires were \n\n\n\n548 WAR AND PEACE \n\nvisible on all sides. He did not then realize the \nsignificance of the burning of Moscow, and \nlooked at the fires with horror. \n\nHe passed four days in the coach house near \nthe Crimean bridge and during that time \nlearned, from the talk of the French soldiers, \nthat all those confined there were awaiting a \ndecision which might come any day from the \nmarshal. What marshal this was, Pierre could \nnot learn from the soldiers. Evidently for them \n"the marshal "represented a very high and rath- \ner mysterious power. \n\nThese first days, before the eighth of Sep- \ntember when the prisoners were had up for a \nsecond examination, were the hardest of all \nfor Pierre. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER X \n\nON THE EIGHTH OF SEPTEMBER an officer avery \nimportant one judging by the respect the \nguards showed him entered the coach house \nwhere the prisoners were. This officer, proba- \nbly someone on the staff, was holding a paper \nin his hand, and called over all the Russians \nthere, naming Pierre as "the man who does \nnot give his name." Glancing indolently and \nindifferently at all the prisoners, he ordered \nthe officer in charge to have them decently \ndressed and tidied up before taking them to \nthe marshal. An hour later a squad of soldiers \narrived and Pierre with thirteen others was led \nto the Virgin's Field. It was a fine day, sunny \nafter rain, and the air was unusually pure. The \nsmoke did not hang low as on the day when \nPierre had been taken from the guardhouse \non the Zubovski rampart, but rose through the \npure air in columns. No flames were seen, but \ncolumns of smoke rose on all sides, and all \nMoscow as far as Pierre could see was one vast \ncharred ruin. On all sides there were waste \nspaces with only stoves and chimney stacks \nstill standing, and here and there the black- \nened walls of some brick houses. Pierre gazed \nat the ruins and did not recognize districts he \nhad known well. Here and there he could see \nchurches that had not been burned. The Krm- \nlin, which was not destroyed, gleamed white in \nthe distance with its towers and the belfry of \nIvan the Great. The domes of the New Con- \nvent of the Virgin glittered brightly and its \nbells were ringing particularly clearly. These \nbells reminded Pierre that it was Sunday and \nthe feast of the Nativity of the Virgin. But \nthere seemed to be no one to celebrate this \nholiday: everywhere were blackened ruins, and \nthe few Russians to be seen were tattered and . \n\n\n\nfrightened people who tried to hide when they \nsaw the French. \n\nIt was plain that the Russian nest was ruined \nand destroyed, but in place of the Russian or- \nder of life that had been destroyed, Pierre un- \nconsciously felt that a quite different, firm, \nFrench order had been established over this \nruined nest. He felt this in the looks of the sol- \ndiers who, marching in regular ranks briskly \nand gaily, were escorting him and the other \ncriminals; he felt it in the looks of an impor- \ntant French official in a carriage and pair driven \nby a soldier, whom they met on the way. He \nfelt it in the merry sounds of regimental music \nhe heard from the left side of the field, and felt \nand realized it especially from the list of pris- \noners the French officer had read out when he \ncame that morning. Pierre had been taken by \none set of soldiers and led first to one and then \nto another place with dozens of other men, and \nit seemed that they might have forgotten him, \nor confused him with the others. But no: the \nanswers he had given when questioned had \ncome back to him in his designation as "the \nman who does not give his name," and under \nthat appellation, which to Pierre seemed ter- \nrible, they were now leading him somewhere \nwith unhesitating assurance on their faces that \nhe and all the other prisoners were exactly the \nones they wanted and that they were being \ntaken to the proper place. Pierre felt himself \nto be an insignificant chip fallen among the \nwheels of a machine whose action he did not \nunderstand but which was working well. \n\nHe and the other prisoners were taken to \nthe right side of the Virgin's Field, to a large \nwhite house with an immense garden not far \nfrom the convent. This was Prince Shcherba- \ntov's house, where Pierre had often been in \nother days, and which, as he learned from the \ntalk of the soldiers, was now occupied by the \nmarshal, the Duke of Eckmiihl (Davout). \n\nThey were taken to the entrance and led in- \nto the house one by one. Pierre was the sixth \nto enter. He was conducted through a glass \ngallery, an anteroom, and a hall, which were \nfamiliar to him, into a long low study at the \ndoor of which stood an adjutant. \n\nDavout, spectacles on nose, sat bent over a \ntable at the further end of the room. Pierre \nwent close up to him, but Davout, evidently \nconsulting a paper that lay before him, did not \nlook up. Without raising his eyes, he said in a \nlow voice: &lt; \n\n"Who are you?" \n\nPierre was silent because he was incapable \n\n\n\nBOOK TWELVE \n\nof uttering a word. To him Davout was not \nmerely a French general, but a man notorious \nfor his cruelty. Looking at his cold face, as he \nsat like a stern schoolmaster who was prepared \nto wait awhile for an answer, Pierre felt that \nevery instant of delay might cost him his life; \nbut he did not know what to say. He did not \nventure to repeat what he had said at his first \nexamination, yet to disclose his rank and posi- \ntion was dangerous and embarrassing. So he \nwas silent. But before he had decided what to \ndo, Davout raised his head, pushed his spec- \ntacles back on his forehead, screwed up his \neyes, and looked intently at him. \n\n"I know that man," he said in a cold, meas- \nured tone, evidently calculated to frighten \nPierre. \n\nThe chill that had been running down \nPierre's back now seized his head as in a vise. \n\n"You cannot know me, General, I have nev- \ner seen you . . ." \n\n"He is a Russian spy," Davout interrupted, \naddressing another general who was present, \nbut whom Pierre had not noticed. \n\nDavout turned away. With an unexpected \nreverberation in his voice Pierre rapidly be- \ngan: \n\n"No, monseigneur," he said, suddenly re- \nmembering that Davout was a duke. "No, mon- \nseigneur, you cannot have known me. I am a \nmilitia officer and have not quitted Moscow." \n\n"Your name?" asked Davout. \n\n"Bezukhov." \n\n"What proof have I that you are not lying?" \n\n"Monseigneur!" exclaimed Pierre, not in an \noffended but in a pleading voice. \n\nDavout looked up and gazed intently at him. \nFor some seconds they looked at one another, \nand that look saved Pierre. Apart from condi- \ntions of war and law, that look established hu- \nman relations between the two men. At that \nmoment an immense number of things passed \ndimly through both their minds, and they re- \nalized that they were both children of human- \nity and were brothers. \n\nAt the first glance, when Davout had only \nraised his head from the papers where human \naffairs and lives were indicated by numbers, \nPierre was merely a circumstance, and Davout \ncould have shot him without burdening his \nconscience with an evil deed, but now he saw \nin him a human being. He reflected for a mo- \nment. \n\n"How can you show me that you are telling \nthe truth?" said Davout coldly. \n\nPierre remembered Ramballe, and named \n\n\n\n549 \n\nhim and his regiment and the street where the \nhouse was. \n\n"You are not what you say," returned Da- \nvout. \n\nIn a trembling, faltering voice Pierre began \nadducing proofs of the truth of his statements. \n\nBut at that moment an adjutant entered and \nreported something to Davout. \n\nDavout brightened up at the news the ad- \njutant brought, and began buttoning up his \nuniform. It seemed that he had quite forgotten \nPierre. \n\nWhen the adjutant reminded him of the \nprisoner, he jerked his head in Pierre's direc- \ntion with a frown and ordered him to be led \naway. But where they were to take him Pierre \ndid not know: back to the coach house or to \nthe place of execution his companions had \npointed out to him as they crossed the Virgin's \nField. \n\nHe turned his head and saw that the adju- \ntant was putting another question to Davout. \n\n"Yes, of coursel" replied Davout, but what \nthis "yes" meant, Pierre did not know. \n\nPierre could not afterwards remember how \nhe went, whether it was far, or in which direc- \ntion. His faculties were quite numbed, he was \nstupefied, and noticing nothing around him \nwent on moving his legs as the others did till \nthey all stopped and he stopped too. The only \nthought in his mind at that time was: who was \nit that had really sentenced him to death? Not \nthe men on the commission that had first ex- \namined him not one of them had wished to \nor, evidently, could have done it. It was not \nDavout, who had looked at him in so human a \nway. In another moment Davout would have \nrealized that he was doing wrong, but just then \nthe adjutant had come in and interrupted him. \nThe adjutant, also, had evidently had no evil \nintent though he might have refrained from \ncoming in. Then who was executing him, kill- \ning him, depriving him of life him, Pierre, \nwith all his memories, aspirations, hopes, and \nthoughts? Who was doing this? And Pierre felt \nthat it was no one. \n\nIt was a system a concurrence of circum- \nstances. \n\nA system of some sort was killing him \nPierre depriving him of life, of everything, \nannihilating him. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI \n\nFROM PRINCE SHCHERBJITOV'S house the pris- \noners were led straight down the Virgin's Field, \nto the left of the nunnery, as far as a kitchen \n\n\n\n55&lt;&gt; \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\ngarden in which a post had been set up. Be- \nyond that post a fresh pit had been dug in the \nground, and near the post and the pit a large \ncrowd stood in a semicircle. The crowd con- \nsisted of a few Russians and many of Napo- \nleon's soldiers who were not on dutyGer- \nmans, Italians, and Frenchmen, in a variety of \nuniforms. To the right and left of the post \nstood rows of French troops in blue uniforms \nwith red epaulets and high boots and shakos. \n\nThe prisoners were placed in a certain or- \nder, according to the list (Pierre was sixth), \nand were led to the post. Several drums sud- \ndenly began to beat on both sides of them, \nand at that sound Pierre felt as if part of his \nsoul had been torn away. He lost the power of \nthinking or understanding. He could only hear \nand see. And he had only one wish that the \nfrightful thing that had to happen should hap- \npen quickly. Pierre looked round at his fellow \nprisoners and scrutinized them. \n\nThe two first were convicts with shaven heads. \nOne was tall and thin, the other dark, shaggy, \nand sinewy, with a flat nose. The third was a \ndomestic serf, about forty-five years old, with \ngrizzled hair and a plump, well-nourished body. \nThe fourth was a peasant, a very handsome \nman with a broad, light-brown beard and black \neyes. The fifth was a factory hand, a thin, \nsallow-faced lad of eighteen in a loose coat. \n\nPierre heard the French consulting whether \nto shoot them separately or two at a time. "In \ncouples," replied the officer in command in a \ncalm voice. There was a stir in the ranks of \nthe soldiers and it was evident that they were \nall hurrying not as men hurry to do some- \nthing they understand, but as people hurry to \nfinish a necessary but unpleasant and incom- \nprehensible task. \n\nA French official wearing a scarf came up to \nthe right of the row of prisoners and read out \nthe sentence in Russian and in French. \n\nThen two pairs of Frenchmen approached \nthe criminals and at the officer's command took \nthe two convicts who stood first in the row. \nThe convicts stopped when they reached the \npost and, while sacks were being brought, \nlooked dumbly around as a wounded beast \nlooks at an approaching huntsman. One crossed \nhimself continually, the other scratched his \nback and made a movement of the lips resem- \nbling a smile. With hurried hands the soldiers \nblindfolded them, drawing the sacks over their \nheads, and bound them to the post. \n\nTwelve sharpshooters with muskets stepped \nout of the ranks with a firm regular tread and \n\n\n\nhalted eight paces from the post. Pierre turned \naway to avoid seeing what was going to hap- \npen. Suddenly a crackling, rolling noise was \nheard which seemed to him louder than the \nmost terrific thunder, and he looked round. \nThere was some smoke, and the Frenchmen \nwere doing something near the pit, with pale \nfaces and trembling hands. Two more prisoners \nwere led up. In the same way and with similar \nlooks, these two glanced vainly at the onlook- \ners with only a silent appeal for protection in \ntheir eyes, evidently unable to understand or \nbelieve what was going to happen to them. \nThey could not believe it because they alone \nknew what their life meant to them, and so \nthey neither understood nor believed that it \ncould be taken from them. \n\nAgain Pierre did not wish to look and again \nturned away; but again the sound as of a fright- \nful explosion struck his ear, and at the same \nmoment he saw smoke, blood, and the pale, \nscared faces of the Frenchmen who were again \ndoing something by the post, their trembling \nhands impeding one another. Pierre, breath- \ning heavily, looked around as if asking what it \nmeant. The same question was expressed in \nall the looks that met his. \n\nOn the faces of all the Russians and of the \nFrench soldiers and officers without exception, \nhe read the same dismay, horror, and conflict \nthat were in his own heart. "But who, after all, \nis doing this? They are all suffering as I am. \nWho then is it? Who?" flashed for an instant \nthrough his mind. \n\n"Sharpshooters of the 86th, forward I" \nshouted someone. The fifth prisoner, the one \nnext to Pierre, was led away alone. Pierre did \nnot understand that he was saved, that he and \nthe rest had been brought there only to wit- \nness the execution. With ever-growing horror, \nand no sense of joy or relief, he gazed at what \nwas taking place. The fifth man was the factory \nlad in the loose cloak. The moment they laid \nhands on him he sprang aside in terror and \nclutched at Pierre. (Pierre shuddered and \nshook himself free.) The lad was unable to \nwalk. They dragged him along, holding him \nup under the arms, and he screamed. When \nthey got him to the post he grew quiet, as if he \nsuddenly understood something. Whether he \nunderstood tha t screami ng was useless or wheth- \ner he thought it incredible that men should \nkill him, at any rate he took his stand at the \npost, waiting to be blindfolded like the others, \nand like a wounded animal looked around \nhim with glittering eyes. \n\n\n\nBOOK TWELVE \n\nPierre was no longer able to turn away and \nclose his eyes. His curiosity and agitation, like \nthat of the whole crowd, reached the highest \npitch at this fifth murder. Like the others this \nfifth man seemed calm; he wrapped his loose \ncloak closer and rubbed one bare foot with \nthe other. \n\nWhen they began to blindfold him he him- \nself adjusted the knot which hurt the back of \nhis head; then when they propped him against \nthe bloodstained post, he leaned back and, not \nbeing comfortable in that position, straight- \nened himself, adjusted his feet, and leaned back \nagain more comfortably. Pierre did not take \nhis eyes from him and did not miss his slightest \nmovement. \n\nProbably a word of command was given and \nwas followed by the reports of eight muskets; \nbut try as he would Pierre could not afterwards \nremember having heard the slightest sound of \nthe shots. He only saw how the workman sud- \ndenly sank down on the cords that held him, \nhow blood showed itself in two places, how \nthe ropes slackened under the weight of the \nhanging body, and how the workman sat down, \nhis head hanging unnaturally and one leg bent \nunder him. Pierre ran up to the post. No one \nhindered him. Pale, frightened people were \ndoing something around the workman. The \nlower jaw of an old Frenchman with a thick \nmustache trembled as he untied the ropes. The \nbody collapsed. The soldiers dragged it awk- \nwardly from the post and began pushing it in- \nto the pit. \n\nThey all plainly and certainly knew that \nthey were criminals who must hide the traces \nof their guilt as quickly as possible. \n\nPierre glanced into the pit and saw that the \nfactory lad was lying with his knees close up \nto his head and one shoulder higher than the \nother. That shoulder rose and fell rhythmical- \nly and convulsively, but spadefuls of earth were \nalready being thrown over the whole body. \nOne of the soldiers, evidently suffering, shouted \ngruffly and angrily at Pierre to go back. But \nPierre did not understand him and remained \nnear the post, and no one drove him away. \n\nWhen the pit had been filled up a command \nwas given. Pierre was taken back to his place, \nand the rows of troops on both sides of the \npost made a half turn and went past it at a \nmeasured pace. The twenty-four sharpshooters \nwith discharged muskets, standing in the cen- \nter of the circle, ran back to their places as the \ncompanies passed by. \n\nPierre gazed now with dazed eyes at these \n\n\n\n55 1 \n\nsharpshooters who ran in couples out of the \ncircle. All but one rejoined their companies. \nThis one, a young soldier, his face deadly pale, \nhis shako pushed back, and his musket resting \non the ground, still stood near the pit at the \nspot from which he had fired. He swayed like \na drunken man, taking some steps forward and \nback to save himself from falling. An old, non- \ncommissioned officer ran out of the ranks and \ntaking him by the elbow dragged him to his \ncompany. The crowd of Russians and French- \nmen began to disperse. They all went away \nsilently and with drooping heads. \n\n"That will teach them to start fires," said \none of the Frenchmen. \n\nPierre glanced round at the speaker and saw \nthat it was a soldier who was trying to find \nsome relief after what had been done, but was \nnot able to do so. Without finishing what he \nhad begun to say he made a hopeless move- \nment with his arm and went away. \n\nCHAPTER XII \n\nAFTER THE EXECUTION Pierre was separated \nfrom the rest of the prisoners and placed alone \nin a small, ruined, and befouled church. \n\nToward evening a noncommissioned officer \nentered with two soldiers and told him that he \nhad been pardoned and would now go to the \nbarracks for the prisoners of war. Without un- \nderstanding what was said to him, Pierre got \nup and went with the soldiers. They took him \nto the upper end of the field, where there were \nsome sheds built of charred planks, beams, and \nbattens, and led him into one of them. In the \ndarkness some twenty different men surround- \ned Pierre. He looked at them without under- \nstanding who they were, why they were there, \nor what they wanted of him. He heard what \nthey said, but did not understand the meaning \nof the words and made no kind of deduction \nfrom or application of them. He replied to \nquestions they put to him, but did not consid- \ner who was listening to his replies, nor how \nthey would understand them. He looked at \ntheir faces and figures, but they all seemed to \nhim equally meaningless. \n\nFrom the moment Pierre had witnessed those \nterrible murders committed by men who did \nnot wish to commit them, it was as if the main- \nspring of his life, on which everything de- \npended and which made everything appear \nalive, had suddenly been wrenched out and \neverything had collapsed into a heap of mean- \ningless rubbish. Though he did not acknowl- \nedge it to himself, his faith in the right order- \n\n\n\n55* \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\ning of the universe, in humanity, in his own \nsoul, and in God, had been destroyed. He had \nexperienced this before, but never so strongly \nas now. When similar doubts had assailed him \nbefore, they had been the result of his own \nwrongdoing, and at the bottom of his heart he \nhad felt that relief from his despair and from \nthose doubts was to be found within himself. \nBut now he felt that the universe had crumbled \nbefore his eyes and only meaningless ruins re- \nmained, and this not by any fault of his own. \nHe felt that it was not in his power to regain \nfaith in the meaning of life. \n\nAround him in the darkness men were stand- \ning and evidently something about him inter- \nested them greatly. They were telling him \nsomething and asking him something. Then \nthey led him away somewhere, and at last he \nfound himself in a corner of the shed among \nmen who were laughing and talking on all \nsides. \n\n"Well, then, mates . . . that very prince who \n. . ." some voice at the other end of the shed \nwas saying, with a strong emphasis on the word \nwho. \n\nSitting silent and motionless on a heap of \nstraw against the wall, Pierre sometimes opened \nand sometimes closed his eyes. But as soon as \nhe closed them he saw before him the dreadful \nface of the factory lad -especially dreadful be- \ncause of its simplicity and the faces of the \nmurderers, even more dreadful because of \ntheir disquiet. And he opened his eyes again \nand stared vacantly into the darkness around \nhim. \n\nBeside him in a stooping position sat a small \nman of whose presence he was first made aware \nby a strong smell of perspiration which came \nfrom him every time he moved. This man was \ndoing something to his legs in the darkness, \nand though Pierre could not see his face he felt \nthat the man continually glanced at him. On \ngrowing used to the darkness Pierre saw that \nthe man was taking off his leg bands, and the \nway he did it aroused Pierre's interest. \n\nHaving unwound the string that tied the \nband on one leg, he carefully coiled it up and \nimmediately set to work on the other leg, \nglancing up at Pierre. While one hand hung \nup the first string the other was already un- \nwinding the band on the second leg. In this \nway, having carefully removed the leg bands \nby deft circular motions of his arm following \none another uninterruptedly, the man hung \nthe leg bands up on some pegs fixed above his \nbead* Then he took out a knife, cut something, \n\n\n\nclosed the knife, placed it under the head of \nhis bed, and, seating himself comfortably, \nclasped his arms round his lifted knees and \nfixed his eyes on Pierre. The latter was con- \nscious of something pleasant, comforting, and \nwell rounded in these deft movements, in the \nman's well-ordered arrangements in his corner, \nand even in his very smell, and he looked at \nthe man without taking his eyes from him. \n\n"You've seen a lot of trouble, sir, eh?" the \nlittle man suddenly said. \n\nAnd there was so much kindliness and sim- \nplicity in his singsong voice that Pierre tried to \nreply, but his jaw trembled and he felt tears \nrising to his eyes. The little fellow, giving Pierre \nno time to betray his confusion, instantly con- \ntinued in the same pleasant tones: \n\n"Eh, lad, don't fret!" said he, in the tender \nsingsong caressing voice old Russian peasant \nwomen employ. "Don't fret, friend'suffer an \nhour, live for an age!' that's how it is, my dear \nfellow. And here we live, thank heaven, with- \nout offense. Among these folk, too, there are \ngood men as well as bad," said he, and still \nspeaking, he turned on his knees with a supple \nmovement, got up, coughed, and went off to \nanother part of the shed. \n\n"Eh, you rascal!" Pierre heard the same kind \nvoice saying at the other end of the shed. "So \nyou've come, you rascal? She remembers. . . . \nNow, now, that'll do!" \n\nAnd the soldier, pushing away a little dog \nthat was jumping up at him, returned to his \nplace and sat down. In his hands he had some- \nthing wrapped in a rag. \n\n"Here, eat a bit, sir," said he, resuming his \nformer respectful tone as he unwrapped and \noffered Pierre some baked potatoes. "We had \nsoup for dinner and the potatoes are grand!" \n\nPierre had not eaten all day arid the smell of \nthe potatoes seemed extremely pleasant to him. \nHe thanked the soldier and began to eat. \n\n"Well, are they all right?" said the soldier \nwith a smile. "You should do like this." \n\nHe took a potato, drew out his clasp knife, \ncut the potato into two equal halves on the \npalm of his hand, sprinkled some salt on it \nfrom the rag, and handed it to Pierre. \n\n"The potatoes are grandl" he said once \nmore. "Eat some like that!" \n\nPierre thought he had never eaten anything \nthat tasted better. \n\n"Oh, I'm all right/' said he, "but why did \nthey shoot those poor fellows? The last one \nwas hardly twenty." \n\n"Tss, tt . . . 1" said the little man. "Ah, what \n\n\n\nBOOK TWELVE \n\n\n\n553' \n\n\n\na sin ... what a sin!" he added quickly, and as \nif his words were always waiting ready in his \nmouth and flew out involuntarily he went on: \n"How was it, sir, that you stayed in Moscow?" \n\n"I didn't think they would come so soon. I \nstayed accidentally," replied Pierre. \n\n"And how did they arrest you, dear lad? At \nyour house?" \n\n"No, I went to look at the fire, and they \narrested me there, and tried me as an incendi- \nary." \n\n"Where there's law there's injustice," put in \nthe little man. \n\n"And have you been here long?" Pierre asked \nas he munched the last of the potato. \n\n"I? It was last Sunday they took me, out of \na hospital in Moscow." \n\n"Why, are you a soldier then?" \n\n"Yes, we are soldiers of the Apsheron regi- \nment. I was dying of fever. We weren't told \nanything. There were some twenty of us lying \nthere. We had no idea, never guessed at all." \n\n"And do you feel sad here?" Pierre inquired. \n\n"How can one help it, lad? My name is Plat- \non, and the surname is Karataev," he added, \nevidently wishing to make it easier for Pierre \nto address him. "They call me 'little falcon' in \nthe regiment. How is one to help feeling sad? \nMoscowshe's the mother of cities. How can \none see all this and not feel sad? But 'the mag- \ngot gnaws the cabbage, yet dies first'; that's \nwhat the old folks used to tell us," he added \nrapidly. \n\n"What? What did you say?" asked Pierre. \n\n"Who? I?" said Karataev. "I say things hap- \npen not as we plan but as God judges," he re- \nplied, thinking that he was repeating what he \nhad said before, and immediately continued: \n\n"Well, and you, have you a family estate, sir? \nAnd a house? So you have abundance, then? \nAnd a housewife? And your old parents, are \nthey still living?" he asked. \n\nAnd though it was too dark for Pierre to see, \nhe felt that a suppressed smile of kindliness \npuckered the soldier's lips as he put these \nquestions. He seemed grieved that Pierre had \nno parents, especially that he had no mother. \n\n"A wife for counsel, a mother-in-law for wel- \ncome, but there's none as dear as one's own \nmother 1" said he. "Well, and have you little \nones?" he went on asking. \n\nAgain Pierre's negative answer seemed to \ndistress him, and he hastened to add: \n\n"Never mind! You're young folks yet, and \nplease God may still have some. The great \nthine is to live in harmony. . . ." \n\n\n\n"But it's all the same now," Pierre could not \nhelp saying. \n\n"Ah, my dear fellow!" rejoined Karatdev, \n"never decline a prison or a beggar's sack!" \n\nHe seated himself more comfortably and \ncoughed, evidently preparing to tell a long \nstory. \n\n"Well, my dear fellow, I was still living at \nhome," he began. "We had a well-to-do home- \nstead, plenty of land, we peasants lived well \nand our house was one to thank God for. When \nFather and we went out mowing there were \nseven of us. We lived well. We were real peas- \nants. It so happened . . ." \n\nAnd Platon Karatdev told a long story of \nhow he had gone into someone's copse to take \nwood, how he had been caught by the keeper, \nhad been tried, flogged, and sent to serve as a \nsoldier. \n\n"Well, lad," and a smile changed the tone of \nhis voice, "we thought it was a misfortune but \nit turned out a blessing! If it had not been for \nmy sin, my brother would have had to go as a \nsoldier. But he, my younger brother, had five \nlittle ones, while I, you see, only left a wife \nbehind. We had a little girl, but God took her \nbefore I went as a soldier. 1 come home on \nleave and I'll tell you how it was, I look and \nsee that they are living better than before. The \nyard full of cattle, the women at home, two \nbrothers away earning wages, andonly Michael \nthe youngest, at home. Father, he says, 'All my \nchildren are the same to me: it hurts the same \nwhichever finger gets bitten. But if Plat6n \nhadn't been shaved for a soldier, Michael \nwould have had to go.' He called us all to him \nand, will you believe it, placed us in front of \nthe icons. 'Michael,' he says, 'come here and \nbow down to his feet; and you, young woman, \nyou bow down too; and you, grandchildren, \nalso bow down before him! Do you under- \nstand?' he says. That's how it is, dear fellow. \nFate looks for a head. But we are always judg- \ning, 'that's not wellthat's not right!' Our luck \nis like water in a dragnet: you pull at it and \nit bulges, but when you've drawn it out it's \nempty! That's how it is." \n\nAnd Plat6n shifted his seat on the straw. \n\nAfter a short silence he rose. \n\n"Well, I think you must be sleepy," said he, \nand began rapidly crossing himself and repeat- \ning: \n\n"Lord Jesus Christ, holy Saint Nicholas, \nFrola and Lavra! Lord Jesus Christ, holy Saint \nNicholas, Frola and Lavra! Lord Jesus Christ, \nhave mercv on us and save us I" he concluded, \n\n\n\n554 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nthen bowed to the ground, got up, sighed, and \nsat down again on his heap of straw. "That's \nthe way. Lay me down like a stone, O God, \nand raise me up like a loaf," he muttered as he \nlay down, pulling his coat over him. \n\n"What prayer was that you were saying?" \nasked Pierre. \n\n"Eh?" murmured Plat6n, who had almost \nfallen asleep. "What was I saying? I was pray- \ning. Don't you pray?" \n\n"Yes, I do," said Pierre. "But what was that \nyou said: Frola and Lavra?" \n\n"Well, of course," replied Plat6n quickly, \n"the horses' saints. One must pity the animals \ntoo. Eh, the rascal! Now you've curled up and \ngot warm, you daughter of a bitch!" said Kara- \ntev, touching the dog that lay at his feet, and \nagain turning over he fell asleep immediately. \n\nSounds of crying and screaming came from \nsomewhere in the distance outside, and flames \nwere visible through the cracks of the shed, \nbut inside it was quiet and dark. For a long \ntime Pierre did not sleep, but lay with eyes \nopen in the darkness, listening to the regular \nsnoring of Plat6n who lay beside him, and he \nfelt that the world that had been shattered was" \nonce more stirring in his soul with a new \nbeauty and on new and unshakable founda- \ntions. \n\nCHAPTER XIII \n\nTWENTY-THREE SOLDIERS, three officers, and \ntwo officials were confined in the shed in which \nPierre had been placed and where he remained \nfor four weeks. \n\nWhen Pierre remembered them afterwards \nthey all seemed misty figures to him except \nPlat6n Karatdev, who always remained in his \nmind a most vivid and precious memory and \nthe personification of everything Russian, \nkindly, and round. When Pierre saw his neigh- \nbor next morning at dawn the first impression \nof him, as of something round, was fully con- \nfirmed: Plat6n's whole figure in a French \novercoat girdled with a cord, a soldier's cap, \nand bast shoes was round. His head was quite \nround, his back, chest, shoulders, and even his \narms, which he held as if ever ready to em- \nbrace something, were rounded, his pleasant \nsmile and his large, gentle brown eyes were \nalso round. \n\nPlat6n Karataev must have been fifty, judg- \ning by his stories of campaigns he had been in, \ntold as by an old soldier. He did not himself \nknow his age and was quite unable to deter- \nmine it. But his brilliantly white, strong teeth \n\n\n\nwhich showed in two unbroken semicircles \nwhen he laughed as he often did were all \nsound and good, there was not a gray hair in \nhis beard or on his head, and his whole body \ngave an impression of suppleness and especial- \nly of firmness and endurance. \n\nHis face, despite its fine, rounded wrinkles, \nhad an expression of innocence and youth, his \nvoice was pleasant and musical. But the chief \npeculiarity of his speech was its directness and \nappositeness. It was evident that he never con- \nsidered what he had said or was going to say, \nand consequently the rapidity and justice of \nhis intonation had an irresistible persuasive- \nness. \n\nHis physical strength and agility during the \nfirst days of his imprisonment were such that \nhe seemed not to know what fatigue and sick- \nness meant. Every night before lying down, he \nsaid: "Lord, lay me down as a stone and raise \nme up as a loaf!" and every morning on get- \nting up, he said: "I lay down and curled up, I \nget up and shake myself." And indeed he only \nhad to lie down, to fall asleep like a stone, and \nhe only had to shake himself, to be ready with- \nout a moment's delay for some work, just as \nchildren are ready to play directly they awake. \nHe could do everything, not very well but not \nbadly. He baked, cooked, sewed, planed, and \nmended boots. He was always busy, and only \nat night allowed himself conversation of which \nhe was fond and songs. He did not sing like a \ntrained singer who knows he is listened to, but \nlike the birds, evidently giving vent to the \nsounds in the same way that one stretches one- \nself or walks about to get rid of stiffness, and \nthe sounds were always high-pitched, mourn- \nful, delicate, and almost feminine, and his face \nat such times was very serious. \n\nHaving been taken prisoner and allowed his \nbeard to grow, he seemed to have thrown off \nall that had been forced upon him everything \nmilitary and alien to himself and had returned \nto his former peasant habits. \n\n"A soldier on leave a shirt outside \nbreeches," l he would say. \n\nHe did not like talking about his life as a \nsoldier, though he did not complain, and often \nmentioned that he had not been flogged once \nduring the whole of his army service. When \nhe related anything it was generally some old \nand evidently precious memory of his "Chris- \n\n1 The peasants wear their shirts fastened by a \ngirdle at the waist and hanging loose outside their \nbreeches, whereas a soldier's shirt is tucked inside. \n-TR. \n\n\n\nBOOK TWELVE \n\n\n\n555 \n\n\n\ntian" life, as he called his peasant existence. \nThe proverbs, of which his talk was full, were \nfor the most part not the coarse and indecent \nsaws soldiers employ, but those folk sayings \nwhich taken without a context seem so insig- \nnificant, but when used appositely suddenly ac- \nquire a significance of profound wisdom. \n\nHe would often say the exact opposite of \nwhat he had said on a previous occasion, yet \nboth would be right. He liked to talk and he \ntalked well, adorning his speech with terms of \nendearment and with folk sayings which Pierre \nthought he invented himself, but the chief \ncharm of his talk lay in the fact that the com- \nmonest events sometimes just such as Pierre \nhad witnessed without taking notice of them \nassumed in Karatdev's speech a character of \nsolemn fitness. He liked to hear the folk tales \none of the soldiers used to tell of an evening \n(they were always the same), but most of all he \nliked to hear stories of real life. He would \nsmile joyfully when listening to such stories, \nnow and then putting in a word or asking a \nquestion to make the moral beauty of what he \nwas told clear to himself. Karataev had no at- \ntachments, friendships, or love, as Pierre un- \nderstood them, but loved and lived affection- \nately with everything life brought him in con- \ntact with, particularly with man not any par- \nticular man, but those with whom he happened \nto be. He loved his dog, his comrades, the \nFrench, and Pierre who was his neighbor, but \nPierre felt that in spite of Karataev's affection- \nate tenderness for him (by which he uncon- \nsciously gave Pierre's spiritual life its due) he \nwould not have grieved for a moment at part- \ning from him. And Pierre began to feel in the \nsame way toward Karataev. \n\nTo all the other prisoners Plat6n Karataev \nseemed a most ordinary soldier. They called \nhim "little falcon" or "Plat6sha," chaffed him \ngood-naturedly, and sent him on errands. But \nto Pierre he always remained what he had \nseemed that first night: an unfathomable, \nrounded, eternal personification of the spirit \nof simplicity and truth. \n\nPlat6n Karataev knew nothing by heart ex- \ncept his prayers. When he began to speak he \nseemed not to know how he would conclude. \n\nSometimes Pierre, struck by the meaning of \nhis words, would ask him to repeat them, but \nPlat6n could never recall what he had said a \nmoment before, just as he never could repeat \nto Pierre the words of his favorite song: native \nand birch tree and my heart is sick occurred in \nit, but when spoken and not sung, no meaning \n\n\n\ncould be got out of it. He did not, and could \nnot, understand the meaning of words apart \nfrom their context. Every word and action of \nhis was the manifestation of an activity un- \nknown to him, which was his life. But his life, \nas he regarded it, had no meaning as a sepa- \nrate thing. It had meaning only as part of a \nwhole of which he was always conscious. His \nwords and actions flowed from him as evenly, \ninevitably, and spontaneously as fragrance ex- \nhales from a flower. He could not understand \nthe value or significance of any word or deed \ntaken separately. \n\nCHAPTER XIV \n\nWHEN PRINCESS MARY heard from Nicholas \nthat her brother was with the Rost6vs at Yaro- \nslavl she at once prepared to go there, in spite \nof her aunt's efforts to dissuade her and not \nmerely to go herself but to take her nephew \nwith her. Whether it were difficult or easy, pos- \nsible or impossible, she did not ask and did \nnot want to know: it was her duty not only \nherself to be near her brother who was perhaps \ndying, but to do everything possible to take his \nson to him, and so she prepared to set off. That \nshe had not heard from Prince Andrew him- \nself, Princess Mary attributed to his being too \nweak to write or to his considering the long \njourney too hard and too dangerous for her \nand his son. \n\nIn a few days Princess Mary was ready to \nstart. Her equipages were the huge family \ncoach in which she had traveled to Voronezh, a \nsemiopen trap, and a baggage cart. With her \ntraveled Mademoiselle Bourienne, little Nich- \nolas and his tutor, her old nurse, three maids, \nTikhon, and a young footman and courier her \naunt had sent to accompany her. \n\nThe usual route through Moscow could not \nbe thought of, and the roundabout way Prin- \ncess Mary was obliged to take through Lipetsk, \nRyazan, Vladimir, and Shuya was very long \nand, as post horses were not everywhere ob- \ntainable, very difficult, and near Ryazan where \nthe French were said to have shown themselves \nwas even dangerous. \n\nDuring this difficult journey Mademoiselle \nBourienne, Dessalles, and Princess Mary's serv- \nants were astonished at her energy and firmness \nof spirit. She went to bed later and rose earlier \nthan any of them, and no difficulties daunted \nher. Thanks to her activity and energy, which \ninfected her fellow travelers, they approached \nYaroslavl by the end of the second week. \n\nThe last days of her stay in Vor6nezh had \n\n\n\n55 6 \n\nbeen the happiest of her life. Her love for Ros- \nt6v no longer tormented or agitated her. It \nfilled her whole soul, had become an integral \npart of herself, and she no longer struggled \nagainst it. Latterly she had become convinced \nthat she loved and was beloved, though she \nnever said this definitely to herself in words. \nShe had become convinced of it at her last in- \nterview with Nicholas, when he had come to \ntell her that her brother was with the Rostovs. \nNot by a single word had Nicholas alluded to \nthe fact that Prince Andrew's relations with \nNatdsha might, if he recovered, be renewed, \nbut Princess Mary saw by his face that he knew \nand thought of this. \n\nYet in spite of that, his relation to her con- \nsiderate, delicate, and loving not only re- \nmained unchanged, but it sometimes seemed \nto Princess Mary that he was even glad that \nthe family connection between them allowed \nhim to express his friendship more freely. She \nknew that she loved for the first and only \ntime in her life and felt that she was beloved, \nand was happy in regard to it. \n\nBut this happiness on one side of her spir- \nitual nature did not prevent her feeling grief \nfor her brother with full force; on the contrary, \nthat spiritual tranquillity on the one side made \nit the more possible for her to give full play to \nher feeling for her brother. That feeling was \nso strong at the moment of leaving Voronezh \nthat those who saw her off, as they looked at \nher careworn, despairing face, felt sure she \nwould fall ill on the journey. But the very dif- \nficulties and preoccupations of the journey, \nwhich she took so actively in hand, saved her \nfora while from her grief and gave her strength. \n\nAs always happens when traveling, Princess \nMary thought only of the journey itself, for- \ngetting its object. But as she approached Yaro- \nslavl the thought of what might await her \nthere not after many days, but that very eve- \nningagain presented itself to her and her agi- \ntation increased to its utmost limit. \n\nThe courier who had been sent on in ad- \nvance to find out where the Rost6vs were stay- \ning in Yaroslavl, and in what condition Prince \nAndrew was, when he met the big coach just \nentering the town gates was appalled by the \nterrible pallor of the princess* face that looked \nout at him from the window. \n\n"I have found out everything, your excel- \nlency: the Rost6vs are staying at the merchant \nBrdnnikov's house, in the Square not far \nfrom here, right above the V61ga," said the \ncourier. \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\nPrincess Mary looked at him with frightened \ninquiry, not understanding why he did not \nreply to what she chiefly wanted to know: how \nwas her brother? Mademoiselle Bourienne put \nthat question for her. \n\n"How is the prince?" she asked. \n\n"His excellency is staying in the same house \nwith them." \n\n"Then he is alive," thought Princess Mary, \nand asked in a low voice: "How is he?" \n\n"The servants say he is still the same." \n\nWhat "still the same" might mean Princess \nMary did not ask, but with an unnoticed glance \nat little seven-year-old Nicholas, who was sit- \nting in front of her looking with pleasure at the \ntown, she bowed her head and did not raise it \nagain till the heavy coach, rumbling, shaking, \nand swaying, came to a stop. The carriage steps \nclattered as they were let down. \n\nThe carriage door was opened. On the left \nthere was water a great river and on the right \na porch. There were people at the entrance: \nservants, and a rosy girl with a large plait of \nblack hair, smiling as it seemed to Princess \nMary in an unpleasantly affected way. (This \nwas S6nya.) Princess Mary ran up the steps. \n"This way, this wayl" said the girl, with the \nsame artificial smile, and the princess found \nherself in the hall facing an elderly woman of \nOriental type, who came rapidly to meet her \nwith a look of emotion. This was the countess. \nShe embraced Princess Mary and kissed her. \n\n"Mon enfant!" she muttered, "je vous aime \net vous connais depuis longtemps." * \n\nDespite her excitement, Princess Mary re- \nalized that this was the countess and that it was \nnecessary to say something to her. Hardly \nknowing how she did it, she contrived to utter \na few polite phrases in French in the same tone \nas those that had been addressed to her, and \nasked: "How is he?" \n\n"The doctor says that he is not in danger," \nsaid the countess, but as she spoke she raised \nher eyes with a sigh, and her gesture conveyed \na contradiction of her words. \n\n"Where is he? Can I see him can I?" asked \nthe princess. \n\n"One moment, Princess, one moment, my \ndearl Is this his son?" said the countess, turn- \ning to little Nicholas who was coming in \nwith Dessalles. "There will be room for every- \nbody, this is a big house. Oh, what a lovely \nboy!" \n\nThe countess took Princess Mary into the \n\n1 "My childl I love you and have known you a \nlong time." \n\n\n\nBOOK TWELVE \n\ndrawing room, where S6nya was talking to \nMademoiselle Bourienne. The countess ca- \nressed the boy, and the old count came in and \nwelcomed the princess. He had changed very \nmuch since Princess Mary had last seen him. \nThen he had been a brisk, cheerful, self-assured \nold man; now he seemed a pitiful, bewildered \nperson. While talking to Princess Mary he con- \ntinually looked round as if asking everyone \nwhether he was doing the right thing. After \nthe destruction of Moscow and of his property, \nthrown out of his accustomed groove he seemed \nto have lost the sense of his own significance and \nto feel that there was no longer a place for him \nin life. \n\nIn spite of her one desire to see her brother \nas soon as possible, and her vexation that at \nthe moment when all she wanted was to see \nhim they should be trying to entertain her and \npretending to admire her nephew, the princess \nnoticed all that was going on around her and \nfelt the necessity of submitting, for a time, to \nthis new order of things which she had entered. \nShe knew it to be necessary, and though it was \nhard for her she was not vexed with these peo- \npie. \n\n"This is my niece," said the count, intro- \nducing S6nya "You don't know her, Princess?" \n\nPrincess Mary turned to S6nya and, trying \nto stifle the hostile feeling that arose in her \ntoward the girl, she kissed her. But she felt op- \npressed by the fact that the mood of everyone \naround her was so far from what was in her \nown heart. \n\n"Where is he?" she asked again, addressing \nthem all. \n\n"He is downstairs. Natasha is with him," \nanswered S6nya, flushing. "We have sent to \nask. I think you must be tired, Princess." \n\nTears of vexation showed themselves in \nPrincess Mary's eyes. She turned away and was \nabout to ask the countess again how to go to \nhim, when light, impetuous, and seemingly \nbuoyant steps were heard at the door. The \nprincess looked round and saw Natdsha coming \nin, almost running that Natasha whom she \nhad liked so little at their meeting in Moscow \nlong since. \n\nBut hardly had the princess looked at Na- \ntdsha's face before she realized that here was \na real comrade in her grief, and consequently a \nfriend. She ran to meet her, embraced her, and \nbegan to cry on her shoulder. \n\nAs soon as Natdsha, sitting at the head of \nPrince Andrew's bed, heard of Princess Mary's \narrival, she softly left his room and hastened to \n\n\n\n557 \n\nher with those swift steps that had sounded \nbuoyant to Princess Mary. \n\nThere was only one expression on her agitat- \ned face when she ran into the drawing room- \nthat of love boundless love for him, for her, \nand for all that was near to the man she loved; \nand of pity, suffering for others, and passion- \nate desire to give herself entirely to helping \nthem. It was plain that at that moment there \nwas in Natasha's heart no thought of herself \nor of her own relations with Prince Andrew. \n\nPrincess Mary, with her acute sensibility, \nunderstood all this at the first glance at Nata- \nsha's face, and wept on her shoulder with sor- \nrowful pleasure. \n\n"Come, come to him, Mary," said Natdsha, \nleading her into the other room. \n\nPrincess Mary raised her head, dried her \neyes, and turned to Natdsha. She felt that from \nher she would be able to understand and learn \neverything. \n\n"How . . ." she began her question but \nstopped short. \n\nShe felt that it was impossible to ask, or to \nanswer, in words. Natasha's face and eyes would \nhave to tell her all more clearly and profound- \n\n\n\nNatdsha was gazing at her, but seemed afraid \nand in doubt whether to say all she knew or \nnot; she seemed to feel that before those lumi- \nnous eyes which penetrated into the very \ndepths of her heart, it was impossible not to \ntell the whole truth which she saw. And sud- \ndenly, Natdsha's lips twitched, ugly wrinkles \ngathered round her mouth, and covering her \nface with her hands she burst into sobs. \n\nPrincess Mary understood. \n\nBut she still hoped, and asked, in words she \nherself did not trust: \n\n"But how is his wound? What is his general \ncondition?" \n\n"You, you . . . will see," was all Natasha \ncould say. \n\nThey sat a little while downstairs near his \nroom till they had left off crying and were able \nto go to him with calm faces. \n\n"How has his whole illness gone? Is it long \nsince he grew worse? When did this happen?" \nPrincess Mary inquired. \n\nNatdsha told her that at first there had been \ndanger from his feverish condition and the \npain he suffered, but at Tr6itsa that had passed \nand the doctor had only been afraid of gan- \ngrene. That danger had also passed. When \nthey reached Yarosldvl the wound had begun \nto fester (Natdsha knew all about such things \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nas festering) and the doctor had said that the \nfestering might take a normal course. Then fe- \nver set in, but the doctor had said the fever was \nnot very serious. \n\n"But two days ago this suddenly happened," \nsaid Natdsha, struggling with her sobs. "I don't \nknow why, but you will see what he is like." \n\n"Is he weaker? Thinner?" asked the princess. \n\n"No, it's not that, but worse. You will see. \nO, Mary, he is too good, he cannot, cannot live, \nbecause . . ." \n\nCHAPTER XV \n\nWHEN NATASHA opened Prince Andrew's door \nwith a familiar movement and let Princess \nMary pass into the room before her, the prin- \ncess felt the sobs rising in her throat. Hard as \nshe had tried to prepare herself, and now tried \nto remain tranquil, she knew that she would be \nunable to look at him without tears. \n\nThe princess understood what Natasha had \nmeant by the words: "two clays ago this sudden- \nly happened." She understood those words to \nmean that he had suddenly softened and that \nthis softening and gentleness were signs of ap- \nproaching death. As she stepped to the door \nshe already saw in imagination Andrew's face \nas she remembered it in childhood, a gentle, \nmild, sympathetic face which he had rarely \nshown, and which therefore affected her very \nstrongly. She was sure he would speak soft, \ntender words to her such as her father had ut- \ntered before his death, and that she would not \nbe able to bear it and would burst into sobs in \nhis presence. Yet sooner or later it had to be, \nand she went in. The sobs rose higher and \nhigher in her throat as she more and more \nclearly distinguished his form and her short- \nsighted eyes tried to make out his features, and \nthen she saw his face and met his gaze. \n\nHe was lying in a squirrel-fur dressing gown \non a divan, surrounded by pillows. He was \nthin and pale. In one thin, translucently white \nhand he held a handkerchief, while with the \nother he stroked the delicate mustache he had \ngrown, moving his fingers slowly. His eyes \ngazed at them as they entered. \n\nOn seeing his face and meeting his eyes Prin- \ncess Mary's pace suddenly slackened, she felt \nher tears dry up and her sobs ceased. She sud- \ndenly felt guilty and grew timid on catching \nthe expression of his face and eyes. \n\n"But in what am I to blame?" she asked her- \nself. And his cold, stern look replied: "Because \nyou are alive and thinking of the living, while \nI ..." \n\n\n\nIn the deep gaze that seemed to look not out- \nwards but inwards there was an almost hostile \nexpression as he slowly regarded his sister and \nNatdsha. \n\nHe kissed his sister, holding her hand in his \nas was their wont. \n\n"How are you, Mary? How did you manage \nto get here?" said he in a voice as calm and \naloof as his look. \n\nHad he screamed in agony, that scream \nwould not have struck such horror into Prin- \ncess Mary's heart as the tone of his voice. \n\n"And have you brought little Nicholas?" he \nasked in the same slow, quiet manner and with \nan obvious effort to remember. \n\n"How are you now?" said Princess Mary, \nherself surprised at what she was saying. \n\n"That, my dear, you must ask the doctor," \nhe replied, and again making an evident effort \nto be affectionate, he said with his lips only \n(his words clearly did not correspond to his \nthoughts): \n\n"Merci, chere amie, d'etre venue." l \n\nPrincess Mary pressed his hand. The pres- \nsure made him wince just perceptibly. He was \nsilent, and she did not know what to say. She \nnow understood what had happened to him \ntwo days before. In his words, his tone, and \nespecially in that calm, almost antagonistic \nlook could be felt an estrangement from every- \nthing belonging to this world, terrible in one \nwho is alive. Evidently only with an effort \ndid he understand anything living; but it \nwas obvious that he failed to understand, \nnot because he lacked the power to do so \nbut because he understood something else- \nsomething the living did not and could not \nunderstand and which wholly occupied his \nmind. \n\n"There, you see how strangely fate has \nbrought us together," said he, breaking the si- \nlence and pointing to Natasha. "She looks aft- \ner me all the time." \n\nPrincess Mary heard him and did not under- \nstand how he could say such a thing. He, the \nsensitive, tender Prince Andrew, how could he \nsay that, before her whom he loved and who \nloved him? Had he expected to live he could \nnot have said those words in that offensively \ncold tone. If he had not known that he was \ndying, how could he have failed to pity her and \nhow could he speak like that in her presence? \nThe only explanation was that he was indiffer- \nent, because something else, much more im- \nportant, had been revealed to him. \n\n1 "Thank you for coming, my dear." \n\n\n\nBOOK TWELVE \n\n\n\n559 \n\n\n\nThe conversation was cold and disconnect- \ned and continually broke off. \n\n"Mary came by way of Ryazdn," said Nata- \nsha. \n\nPrince Andrew did not notice that she called \nhis sister Mary, and only after calling her so in \nhis presence did Natisha notice it herself. \n\n"Really?" he asked. \n\n"They told her that all Moscow has been \nburned down, and that . . ." \n\nNatasha stopped. It was impossible to talk. \nIt was plain that he was making an effort to lis- \nten, but could not do so. \n\n"Yes, they say it's burned," he said. "It's a \ngreat pity," and he gazed straight before him, \nabsently stroking his mustache with his fingers. \n\n"And so you have met Count Nicholas, \nMary?" Prince Andrew suddenly said, evident- \nly wishing to speak pleasantly to them. "He \nwrote here that he took a great liking to you," \nhe went on simply and calmly, evidently un- \nable to understand all the complex significance \nhis words had for living people. "If you liked \nhim too, it would be a good thing for you to \nget married," he added rather more quickly, \nas if pleased at having found words he had \nlong been seeking. \n\nPrincess Mary heard his words but they had \nno meaning for her, except as a proof of how \nfar away he now was from everything living. \n\n"Why talk of me?" she said quietly and \nglanced at Natasha. \n\nNat&amp;sha, who felt her glance, did not look \nat her. All three were again silent. \n\n"Andrew, would you like . . ." Princess Mary \nsuddenly said in a trembling voice, "would you \nlike to see little Nicholas? He is always talking \nabout you!" \n\nPrince Andrew smiled just perceptibly and \nfor the first time, but Princess Mary, who knew \nhis face so well, saw with horror that he did not \nsmile with pleasure or affection for his son, \nbut with quiet, gentle irony because he thought \nshe was trying what she believed to be the last \nmeans of arousing him. \n\n"Yes, I shall be very glad to see him. Is he \nquite well?" \n\nWhen little Nicholas was brought in to Prince \nAndrew's room he looked at his father with \nfrightened eyes, but did not cry, because no one \nelse was crying. Prince Andrew kissed him and \nevidently did not know what to say to him. \n\nWhen Nicholas had been led away, Princess \nMary again went up to her brother, kissed him, \nand unable to restrain her tears any longer \nbegan to cry. \n\n\n\nHe looked at her attentively. \n\n"Is it about Nicholas?" he asked. \n\nPrincess Mary nodded her head, weeping. \n\n"Mary, you know the Gosp . . ." but he \nbroke off. \n\n"What did you say?" \n\n"Nothing. You mustn't cry here," he said, \nlooking at her with the same cold expression. \n\nWhen Princess Mary began to cry, he under- \nstood that she was crying at the thought that \nlittle Nicholas would be left without a father. \nWith a great effort he tried toreturn to lifeand \nto see things from their point of view. \n\n"Yes, to them it must seem sadl" he thought. \n"But how simple it is. \n\n"The fowls of the air sow not, neither do \nthey reap, yet your Father feedeth them," he \nsaid to himself and wished to say to Princess \nMary; "but no, they will take it their own way, \nthey won't understand! They can't understand \nthat all those feelings they prize so all our \nfeelings, all those ideas that seem so important \nto us, are unnecessary. We cannot understand \none another," and he remained silent. \n\nPrince Andrew's little son was seven. He \ncould scarcely read, and knew nothing. After \nthat day he lived through many things, gaining \nknowledge, observation, and experience, but \nhad he possessed all the faculties he afterwards \nacquired, he could not have had a better or \nmore profound understanding of the meaning \nof the scene he had witnessed between his fa- \nther, Mary, and Natasha, than he had then. He \nunderstood it completely, and, leaving the room \nwithout crying, went silently up to Natdsha \nwho had come out with him and looked shyly \nat her with his beautiful, thoughtful eyes, then \nhis uplifted, rosy upper lip trembled and lean- \ning his head against her he began to cry. \n\nAfter that he avoided Dessalles and the \ncountess who caressed him and either sat alone \nor came timidly to Princess Mary, or to Na- \ntAsha of whom he seemed even fonder than \nof his aunt, and clung to them quietly and \nshyly. \n\nWhen Princess Mary had left Prince An- \ndrew she fully understood what Natdsha's face \nhad told her. She did not speak any more to \nNatdsha of hopes of saving his life. She took \nturns with her beside his sofa, and did not cry \nany more, but prayed continually, turning in \nsoul to that Eternal and Unfathomable, whose \npresence above the dying man was now so evi- \ndent. \n\n\n\n5 6 \n\nCHAPTER XVI \n\nNOT ONLY did Prince Andrew know he would \ndie, but he felt that he was dying and was al- \nready half dead. He was conscious of an aloof- \nness from everything earthly and a strange and \njoyous lightness of existence. Without haste \nor agitation he awaited what was coming. That \ninexorable, eternal, distant, and unknown \nthe presence of which he had felt continually \nall his life was now near to him and, by the \nstrange lightness he experienced, almost com- \nprehensible and palpable. . . . \n\nFormerly he had feared the end. He had \ntwice experienced that terribly tormenting \nfear of death the end but now he no longer \nunderstood that fear. \n\nHe had felt it for the first time when the \nshell spun like a top before him, and he looked \nat the fallow field, the bushes, and the sky, and \nknew that he was face to face with death. When \nhe came to himself after being wounded and \nthe flower of eternal, unfettered love had in- \nstantly unfolded itself in his soul as if freed \nfrom the bondage of life that had restrained it, \nhe no longer feared death and ceased to think \nabout it. \n\nDuring the hours of solitude, suffering, and \npartial delirium he spent after he was wound- \ned, the more deeply he penetrated into the \nnew principle of eternal love revealed to him, \nthe more he unconsciously detached himself \nfrom earthly life. To love everything and ev- \nerybody and always to sacrifice oneself for love \nmeant not to love anyone, not to live this earth- \nly life. And the more imbued he became with \nthat principle of love, the more he renounced \nlife and the more completely he destroyed that \ndreadful barrier which in the absence of such \nlove stands between life and death. When \nduring those first days he remembered that he \nwould have to die, he said to himself: "Well, \nwhat of it? So much the better!" \n\nBut after the night in Mytishchi when, half \ndelirious, he had seen her for whom he longed \nappear before him and, having pressed her \nhand to his lips, had shed gentle, happy tears, \nlove for a particular woman again crept un- \nobserved into his heart and once more bound \nhim to life. And joyful and agitating thoughts \nbegan to occupy his mind. Recalling the mo- \nment at the ambulance station when he had \nseen KurAgin, he could not now regain the \nfeeling he then had, but was tormented by the \nquestion whether Kurdgin was alive. And he \ndared not inquire. \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\nHis illness pursued its normal physical \ncourse, but what Natdsha referred to when she \nsaid: "This suddenly happened," had occurred \ntwo days before Princess Mary arrived. It was \nthe last spiritual struggle between life and \ndeath, in which death gained the victory. It \nwas the unexpected realization of the fact that \nhe still valued life as presented to him in the \nform of his love for Natdsha, and a last, though \nultimately vanquished, attack of terror before \nthe unknown. \n\nIt was evening. As usual after dinner he was \nslightly feverish, and his thoughts were pre- \nternaturally clear. S6nya was sitting by the \ntable. He began to doze. Suddenly a feeling of \nhappiness seized him. \n\n"Ah, she has come!" thought he. \n\nAnd so it was: in S6nya's place sat Natasha \nwho had just come in noiselessly. \n\nSince she had begun looking after him, he had \nalways experienced this physical consciousness \nof her nearness. She was sitting in an armchair \nplaced sideways, screening the light of the can- \ndle from him, and was knitting a stocking. \nShe had learned to knit stockings since Prince \nAndrew had casually mentioned that no one \nnursed the sick so well as old nurses who knit \nstockings, and that there is something soothing \nin the knitting of stockings. The needles clicked \nlightly in her slender, rapidly moving hands, \nand he could clearly see the thoughtful profile \nof her drooping face. She moved, and the ball \nrolled off her knees. She started, glanced round \nat him, and screening the candle with her hand \nstooped carefully with a supple and exact \nmovement, picked up the ball, and regained \nher former position. \n\nHe looked at her without moving and saw \nthat she wanted to draw a deep breath after \nstooping, but refrained from doing so and \nbreathed cautiously. \n\nAt the Troitsa monastery they had spoken \nof the past, and he had told her that if he \nlived he would always thank God for his \nwound which had brought them together \nagain, but after that they never spoke of the \nfuture. \n\n"Can it or can it not be?" he now thought \nas he looked at her and listened to the light \nclick of the steel needles. "Can fate have \nbrought me to her so strangely only for me to \ndie? ... Is it possible that the truth of life has \nbeen revealed to me only to show me that I \nhave spent my life in falsity? I love her more \nthan anything in the world! But what am I to \ndo if I love her?" he thought, and he involun- \n\n\n\nBOOK TWELVE \n\ntarily groaned, from a/iabit acquired during \nhis sufferings. \n\nOn hearing that sound Natdsha put down \nthe stocking, leaned nearer to him, and sud- \ndenly, noticing his shining eyes, stepped light- \nly up to him and bent over him. \n\n"You are not asleep?" \n\n"No, I have been looking at you a long time. \nI felt you come in. No one else gives me that \nsense of soft tranquillity that you do ... that \nlight. I want to weep for joy." \n\nNatdsha drew closer to him. Her face shone \nwith rapturous joy. \n\n"Natdsha, I love you too muchl More than \nanything in the world." \n\n"And I!" She turned away for an instant. \n"Why too much?" she asked. \n\n"Why too much? . , . Well, what do you \nthink, what do you feel in your soul, your \nwhole soul shall I live? What do you think?" \n\n"I am sureof it, surel" Natdsha almost shout- \ned, taking hold of both his hands with a pas- \nsionate movement. \n\nHe remained silent awhile. \n\n"How good it would be!" and taking her \nhand he kissed it. \n\nNatasha felt happy and agitated, but at \nonce remembered that this would not do and \nthat he had to be quiet. \n\n"But you have not slept," she said, repress- \ning her joy. "Try to sleep . . . please!" \n\nHe pressed her hand and released it, and \nshe went back to the candleand sat down again \nin her former position. Twice she turned and \nlooked at him, and her eyes met his beaming \nat her. She set herself a task on her stocking \nand resolved not to turn round till it was fin- \nished. \n\nSoon he really shut his eyes and fell asleep. \nHe did not sleep long and suddenly awoke \nwith a start and in a cold perspiration. \n\nAs he fell asleep he had still been thinking \nof the subject that now always occupied his \nmind about life and death, and chiefly about \ndeath. He felt himself nearer to it. \n\n"Love? What is love?" he thought. \n\n"Love hinders death. Love is life. All, every- \nthing that I understand, I understand only \nbecause I love. Everything is, everything ex- \nists, only because 1 love. Everything is united \nby it alone. Love is God, and to die means that \nI, a particle of love, shall return to the general \nand eternal source." These thoughts seemed to \nhim comforting. But they were only thoughts. \nSomething was lacking in them, they were not \nclear, they were too one-sidedly personal and \n\n\n\n561 \n\nbrain-spun. And there was the former agita- \ntion and obscurity. He fell asleep. \n\nHe dreamed that he was lying in the room he \nreally was in, but that hewas quite well and un- \nwounded. Many various, indifferent, and insig- \nnificant people appeared before him. He talked \nto them and discussed something trivial. They \nwere preparing to go away somewhere. Prince \nAndrew dimly realized that all this was trivial \nand that he had more important cares, but he \ncontinued to speak, surprising them by empty \nwitticisms. Gradually, unnoticed, all these per- \nsons began to disappear and a single question, \nthat of the closed door, superseded all else. He \nrose and went to the door to bolt and lock it. \nEverything depended on whether he was, or \nwas not, in time to lock it. He went, and tried \nto hurry, but his legs refused to move and he \nknew he would not be in time to lock the door \nthough he painfullystrained all his powers. He \nwas seized by an agonizing fear. And that fear \nwas the fear of death. It stood behind the door. \nBut just when he was clumsily creeping to- \nward the door, that dreadful something on the \nother side was already pressing against it \nand forcing its way in. Something not hu- \nmandeathwas breaking in through that \ndoor, and had to be kept out. He seized the \ndoor, making a final effort to hold it back to \nlock it was no longer possible but his efforts \nwere weak and clumsy and the door, pushed \nfrom behind by that terror, opened and closed \nagain. \n\nOnce again it pushed from outside. His last \nsuperhuman efforts were vain and both halves \nof the door noiselessly opened. It entered, and \nit was death, and Prince Andrew died. \n\nBut at the instant he died, Prince Andrew re- \nmembered that he was asleep, and at the very \ninstant he died, having made an effort, he \nawoke. \n\n"Yes, it was death! I died and woke up. \nYes, death is an awakening!" And all at once it \ngrew light in his soul and the veil that had till \nthen concealed the unknown was lifted from \nhis spiritual vision. He felt as if powers till \nthen confined within him had been liberated, \nand that strange lightness did not again leave \nhim. \n\nWhen, waking in a cold perspiration, he \nmoved on the divan, Natdsha went up and \nasked him what was the matter. He did not \nanswer and looked at her strangely, not under- \nstanding. \n\nThat was what had happened to him two \ndays before Princess Mary's arrival. From that \n\n\n\n56* \n\nday, as the doctor expressed it, the wasting \nfever assumed a malignant character, but what \nthe doctor said did not interest Natasha, she \nsaw the terrible moral symptoms which to \nher were more convincing. \n\nFrom that day an awakening from life came \nto Prince Andrew together with his awakening \nfrom sleep. And compared to the duration of \nlife it did not seem to him slower than an \nawakening from sleep compared to the dura- \ntion of a dream. \n\nThere was nothing terrible or violent in this \ncomparatively slow awakening. \n\nHis last days and hours passed in an ordinary \nand simple way. Both Princess Mary and Na- \ntdsha, who did not leave him, felt this. They \ndid not weep or shudder and during these last \ndays they themselves felt that they were not \nattending on him (he was no longer there, he \nhad left them) but on what reminded them \nmost closely of him his body. Both felt this so \nstrongly that the outward and terrible side of \ndeath did not affect them and they did not feel \nit necessary to foment their grief. Neither in his \npresence nor out of it did they weep, nor did \nthey ever talk to one another about him. They \nfelt that they could not express in words what \nthey understood. \n\nThey both saw that he was sinking slowly \nand quietly, deeper and deeper, away from \nthem, and they both knew that this had to be \nso and that it was right. \n\nHe confessed, and received communion: ev- \neryone came to take leave of him. When they \nbrought his son to him, he pressed his lips to \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\nthe boy's and turnec|taway, not because he \nfelt it hard and sad (Princess Mary and Nat- \nsha understood that) but simply because he \nthought it was all that was required of him, \nbut when they told him to bless the boy, he did \nwhat was demanded and looked round as if \nasking whether there was anything else he \nshould do. \n\nWhen the last convulsions of the body, which \nthe spirit was leaving, occurred, Princess Mary \nand Natdsha were present. \n\n"Is it over?" said Princess Mary when his \nbody had for a few minutes lain motionless, \ngrowing cold before them. Natdsha went up, \nlooked at the dead eyes, and hastened to close \nthem. She closed them but did not kiss them, \nbut clung to that which reminded her most \nnearly of him his body. \n\n"Where has he gone? Where is he now? . . ." \n\nWhen the body, washed and dressed, lay in \nthe coffin on a table, everyone came to take \nleave of him and they all wept. \n\nLittle Nicholas cried because his heart was \nrent by painful perplexity. The countess and \nS6nya cried from pity for Natasha and because \nhe was no more. The old count cried because \nhe felt that before long, he, too, must take the \nsame terrible step. \n\nNatdsha and Princess Mary also wept now, \nbut not because of their own personal grief; \nthey wept with a reverent and softening emo- \ntion which had taken possession of their souls \nat the consciousness of the simple and solemn \nmystery of death that had been accomplished \nin their presence. \n\n\n\nBook Thirteen: 1812 \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I \n\nMAN'S MIND cannot grasp the causes of events \nin their completeness, but the desire to find \nthose causes is implanted in man's soul. And \nwithout considering the multiplicity and com- \nplexity of the conditions any one of which \ntaken separately may seem to be the cause, he \nsnatches at the first approximation to a cause \nthat seems to him intelligible and says: "This \nis the cause!" In historical events (where the \nactions of men are the subject of observation) \nthe first and most primitive approximation to \npresent itself was the will of the gods and, aft- \ner that, the will of those who stood in the most \nprominent position the heroes of history. But \nwe need only penetrate to the essence of any \nhistoric event which lies in the activity of the \ngeneral mass of men who take part in it to be \nconvinced that the will of the historic hero \ndoes not control the actions of the mass but is \nitself continually controlled. It may seem to \nbe a matter of indifference whether we under- \nstand die meaning of historical events this \nway or that; yet there is the same difference \nbetween a man who says that the people of the \nWest moved on the East because Napoleon \nwished it and a man who says that this hap- \npened because it had to happen, as there is be- \ntween those who declared that the earth was \nstationary and that the planets moved round \nit and those who admitted that they did not \nknow what upheld the earth, but knew there \nwere laws directing its movement and that of \nthe other planets. There is, and can be, no \ncause of an historical event except the one \ncause of all causes. But there are laws direct- \ning events, and some of these laws are known \nto us while we are conscious of others we can- \nnot comprehend. The discovery of these laws \nis only possible when we have quite abandoned \nthe attempt to find the cause in the will of \nsome one man, just as the discovery of the laws \nof the motion of the planets was possible only \nwhen men abandoned the conception of the \nfixity of the earth. \n\n\n\nThe historians consider that, next to the \nbattle of Borodin6 and the occupation of Mos- \ncow by the enemy and its destruction by fire, \nth'e most important episode of the war of 1812 \nwas the movement of the Russian army from \nthe Ryazan to the Kaluga road and to the \nTarutino camp the so-called flank march \nacross the Krdsnaya Fakhra River. They as- \ncribe the glory of that achievement of genius \nto different men and dispute as to whom the \nhonor is due. Even foreign historians, includ- \ning the French, acknowledge the genius of the \nRussian commanders when they speak of that \nRank march. But it is hard to understand why \nmilitary writers, and following them others, \nconsider this flank march to be the profound \nconception of some one man who saved Rus- \nsia and destroyed Napoleon. In the first place \nit is hard to understand where the profundity \nand genius of this movement lay, for not much \nmental effort was needed to see that the best \nposition for an army when it is not being at- \ntacked is where there are most provisions; and \neven a dull boy of thirteen could have guessed \nthat the best position for an army after its re- \ntreat from Moscow in 1812 was on the Kaluga \nroad. So it is impossible to understand by what \nreasoning the historians reach the conclusion \nthat this maneuver was a profound one. And \nit is even more difficult to understand just why \nthey think that this maneuver was calculated \nto save Russia and destroy the French; for this \nflank march, had it been preceded, accom- \npanied, or followed by other circumstances, \nmight have proved ruinous to the Russians \nand salutary for the French. If the position of \nthe Russian army really began to improve \nfrom the time of that march, it does not at all \nfollow that the march was the cause of it. \n\nThat flank march might not only have failed \nto give any advantage to the Russian army, \nbut might in other circumstances have led to \nits destruction. What would have happened \nhad Moscow not burned down? If Murat had \nnot lost sight of the Russians? If Napoleon had \n\n\n\n563 \n\n\n\n564 \n\n\n\nnot remained inactive? If the Russian army at \nKrasnaya Fakhra had given battle as Berinig- \nsen and Barclay advised? What would have \nhappened had the French attacked the Rus- \nsians while they were marching beyond the \nFakhra? What would have happened if on ap- \nproaching Tarutino, Napoleon had attacked \nthe Russians with but a tenth of the energy he \nhad shown when he attacked them at Smo- \nle*nsk? What would have happened had the \nFrench moved on Petersburg? ... In any of \nthese eventualities the flank march that brought \nsalvation might have proved disastrous. \n\nThe third and most incomprehensible thing \nis that people studying history deliberately \navoid seeing that this flank march cannot be \nattributed to any one man, that no one ever \nforesaw it, and that in reality, like the retreat \nfrom Fill, it did not suggest itself to anyone in \nits entirety, but resultedmoment by moment, \nstep by step, event by event from an endless \nnumber of most diverse circumstances and was \nonly seen in its entirety when it had been ac- \ncomplished and belonged to the past. \n\nAt the council at Fili the prevailing thought \nin the minds of the Russian commanders was \nthe one naturally suggesting itself, namely, a \ndirect retreat by the Nizhni road. In proof of \nthis there is the fact that the majority of the \ncouncil voted for such a retreat, and above all \nthere is the well-known conversation after the \ncouncil, between the commander in chief and \nLansk6y, who was in charge of the commissa- \nriat department. Lanskoy informed the com- \nmander in chief that the army supplies were \nfor the most part stored along the Oka in the \nTula and Ryazan provinces, and that if they re- \ntreated on Nizhni the army would be separated \nfrom its supplies by the broad river Oka, which \ncannot be crossed early in winter. This was the \nfirst indication of the necessity of deviating \nfrom what had previously seemed the most \nnatural course a direct retreat on Nizhni- \nN6vgorod.The army turned more to the south, \nalong the Ryazan road and nearer to its sup- \nplies. Subsequently the inactivity of the French \n(who even lost sight of the Russian army), con- \ncern for the safety of the arsenal at Tula, and \nespecially the advantages of drawing nearer to \nits supplies caused thearmy to turn still further \nsouth to the Tula road. Having crossed over, \nby a forced march, to the Tula road beyond the \nFakhra, the Russian commanders intended to \nremain at Podolsk and had no thought of the \nTartitino position; but innumerable circum- \nstances and the reappearance of French troops \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\nwho had for a time lost touch with the Rus- \nsians, and projects of giving battle, and above \nall the abundance of provisions in Kaluga \nprovince, obliged our army to turn still more \nto the south and to cross from the Tula to the \nKaluga road and go toTariitino, which was be- \ntween the roads along which those supplies \nlay. Just as it is impossible to say when it was \ndecided to abandon Moscow, so it is impossible \nto say precisely when, or by whom, it was de- \ncided to move to Tarutino. Only when the \narmy had got there, as the result of innumer- \nable and varying forces, did people begin to \nassure themselves that they had desired this \nmovement and long ago foreseen its result. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER II \n\nTHE FAMOUS FLANK MOVEMENT merely consist- \ned in this: after the advance of the French had \nceased, the Russian army, which had been con- \ntinually retreating straight back from the in- \nvaders, deviated from that direct course and, \nnot finding itself pursued, was naturally drawn \ntoward the district where supplies were abun- \ndant. \n\nIf instead of imagining to ourselves com- \nmanders of genius leading the Russian army, \nwe picture that army without any leaders, it \ncould not have done anything but make a re- \nturn movement toward Moscow, describing \nan arc in the direction where most provisions \nwere to be found and where the country was \nrichest. \n\nThat movement from the Nizhni to the Ry- \nazdn, Tula, and Kaluga roads was so natural \nthat even the Russian marauders moved in that \ndirection, and demands were sent from Peters- \nburg for Kutuzov to take his army that way. \nAt Tarutino Kutuzov received what was almost \na reprimand from the Emperor for having \nmoved his army along the Ryazan road, and the \nEmperor's letter indicated to him the very po- \nsition he had already occupied near Kaluga. \n\nHaving rolled like a ball in the direction of \nthe impetus given by the whole campaign and \nby the battle of Borodin6, the Russian army \nwhen the strength of that impetus was exhaust- \ned and no fresh push was received assumed \nthe position natural to it. \n\nKutuzov's merit lay, not in any strategic ma- \nneuver of genius, as it is called, but in the fact \nthat he alone understood the significance of \nwhat had happened. He alone then understood \nthe meaning of the French army's inactivity, \nhe alone continued to assert that the battle of \nBorodin6 had been a victory, he alone who as \n\n\n\ncommander in chief might have been expected \nto be eager to attack employed his whole \nstrength to restrain the Russian army from use- \nless engagements. \n\nThe beast wounded at Borodin6 was lying \nwhere the fleeing hunter had left him; but \nwhether he was still alive, whether he was \nstrong and merely lying low, the hunter did \nnot know. Suddenly the beast was heard to \nmoan. \n\nThe moan of that wounded beast (the \nFrench army) which betrayed its calamitous \ncondition was the sending of Lauriston to Ku- \ntuzov's camp with overtures for peace. \n\nNapoleon, with his usual assurance that \nwhatever entered his head was right, wrote to \nKutuzov the first words that occurred to him, \nthough they were meaningless. \n\nMONSIEUR LE PRINCE KOUTOUZOV: I am sending \none of my adjutants-general to discuss several in- \nteresting questions with you. I beg your Highness \nto credit what he says to you, especially when he \nexpresses the sentiment of esteem and special re- \ngard I have long entertained for your person. This \nletter having no other object, I pray God t mon- \nsieur le prince Koutouzov f to keep you in His holy \nand gracious protection! NAPOLEON \n\nMoscow, October 30, 1812 \n\nKutuzov replied: "I should be cursed by pos- \nterity were I looked on as the initiator of a \nsettlement of any sort. Such is the present \nspirit of my nation." But he continued to exert \nall his powers to restrain his troops from at- \ntacking. \n\nDuring the month that the French troops \nwere pillaging in Moscow and the Russian \ntroops were quietly encamped at Tariitino, a \nchange had taken place in the relative strength \nof the two armies both in spirit and in num- \nberas a result of which the superiority had \npassed to the Russian side. Though the condi- \ntion and numbers of the French army were un- \nknown to the Russians, as soon as that change \noccurred the need of attacking at once showed \nitself by countless signs. These signs were: \nLauriston's mission; the abundance of pro- \nvisions at Tarutino; the reports coming in from \nall sides of the inactivity and disorder of the \nFrench; the flow of recruits to our regiments; \nthe fine weather; the long rest the Russian \nsoldiers had enjoyed, and the impatience to \ndo what they had been assembled for, which \nusually shows itself in an army that has been \nresting; curiosity as to what the French army, \nso long lost sight of, was doing; the boldness \nwith which our outposts now scouted close up \n\n\n\nBOOK THIRTEEN 565 \n\nto the French stationed at Tarutino; the news \nof easy successes gained by peasants and guer- \nrilla troops over the French, the envy aroused \nby this; the desire for revenge that lay in the \nheart of every Russian as long as the French \nwere in Moscow, and (above all) a dim con- \nsciousness in every soldier's mind that the rel- \native strength of the armies had changed and \nthat the advantage was now on our side. There \nwas a substantial change in the relative strength, \nand an advance had become inevitable. And \nat once, as a clock begins to strike and chime \nas soon as the minute hand has completed a \nfull circle, this change was shown by an in- \ncreased activity, whirring, and chiming in the \nhigher spheres. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER III \n\nTHE RUSSIAN ARMY was commanded by Kutu- \nzov and his staff, and also by the Emperor from \nPetersburg. Before the news of the abandon- \nment of Moscow had been received in Peters- \nburg, a detailed plan of the whole campaign \nhad been drawn up and sent to Kutuzov for \nhis guidance. Though this plan had been \ndrawn up on the supposition that Moscow was \nstill in our hands, it was approved by the \nstaff and accepted as a basis for action. Kutu- \nzov only replied that movements arranged \nfrom a distance were always difficult to execute. \nSo fresh instructions were sent for the solu- \ntion of difficulties that might be encountered, \nas well as fresh people who were to watch Ku- \ntiizov's actions and report upon them. \n\nBesides this, the whole staff of the Russian \narmy was now reorganized. The posts left va- \ncant by Bagrati6n, who had been killed, and \nby Barclay, who had gone away in dudgeon, \nhad to be filled. Very serious consideration \nwas given to the question whether it would be \nbetter to put A in B's place and B in D's, or on \nthe contrary to put D in A's place, and so on \nas if anything more than A's or B's satisfaction \ndepended on this. \n\nAs a result of the hostility between Kutuzov \nand Bennigsen, his Chief of Staff, the presence \nof confidential representatives of the Emperor, \nand these transfers, a more than usually com- \nplicated play of parties was going on among \nthe staff of the army. A was undermining B, \nD was undermining C, and so on in all possi- \nble combinations and permutations. In all \nthese plottings the subject of intrigue was gen- \nerally the conduct of the war, which all these \nmen believed they were directing; but this af- \nfair of the war went on independently of them, \n\n\n\n5 66 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nas it had to go: that is, never in the way peo- \nple devised, but flowing always from the es- \nsential attitude of the masses. Only in the high- \nest spheres did all these schemes, crossings, and \ninterminglings appear to be a true reflection \nof what had to happen. \n\nPrince Michael Ilarionovich! (wrote the Em- \nperor on the second of October in a letter that \nreached Kutuzov after the battle at Tarutino) \nSince September 2 Moscow has been in the hands \nof the enemy. Your last reports were written on \nthe twentieth, and during all this time not only \nhas no action been taken against the enemy or for \nthe relief of the ancient capital, but according to \nyour last report you have even retreated farther. \nSerpukhov is already occupied by an enemy de- \ntachment and Tula with its famous arsenal, so in- \ndispensable to the army, is in danger. From Gen- \neral Wintzingerode's reports, I see lhat an enemy \ncorps of ten thousand men is moving on the Peters- \nburg road. Another corps of several thousand men \nis moving on Dmftrov. A third has advanced along \nthe Vladimir road, and a fourth, rather consider- \nable detachment is stationed between Ruza and \nMozhaysk. Napoleon himself was in Moscow as \nlate as the twenty-fifth. In view of all this informa- \ntion, when the enemy has scattered his forces in \nlarge detachments, and with Napoleon and his \nGuards in Moscow, is it possible that the enemy's \nforces confronting you are so considerable as not \nto allow of your taking the offensive? On the con- \ntrary, he is probably pursuing you with detach- \nments, or at most with an army corps much \nweaker than the army entrusted to you. It would \nseem that, availing yourself of these circumstances, \nyou might advantageously attack a weaker enemy \nand annihilate him, or at least oblige him to re- \ntreat, retaining in our hands an important part \nof the provinces now occupied by the enemy, and \nthereby averting danger from Tula and other \ntowns in the interior. You will be responsible if \nthe enemy is able to direct a force of any si/e \nagainst Petersburg to threaten this capital in \nwhich it has not been possible to retain many \ntroops; for with the army entrusted to you, and \nacting with resolution and energy, you have ample \nmeans to avert this fresh calamity. Remember \nthat you have still to answer to our offended \ncountry for the loss of Moscow. You have experi- \nenced my readiness to reward you. That readiness \nwill not weaken in me, but I and Russia have a \nright to expect from you all the zeal, firmness, and \nsuccess which your intellect, military talent, and \nthe courage of the troops you command justify us \nin expecting. \n\nBut by the time this letter, which proved \nthat the real relation of the forces had already \nmade itself felt in Petersburg, was dispatched, \nKutuzov had found himself unable any longer \nto restrain the army he commanded from at- \n\n\n\ntacking and a battle had taken place. \n\nOn the second of October a Cossack, Shapo- \nvalov, who was out scouting, killed one hare \nand wounded another. Following the wounded \nhare he made his way far into the forest and \ncame upon the left flank of Murat's army, en- \ncamped there without any precautions. The \nCossack laughingly told his comrades how he \nhad almost fallen into the hands of the French. \nA cornet, hearing the story, informed his com- \nmander. \n\nThe Cossack was sent for and questioned. \nThe Cossack officers wished to take advantage \nof this chance to capture some horses, but one \nof the superior officers, who was acquainted \nwith the higher authorities, reported the in- \ncident to a general on the staff. The state of \nthings on the staff had of late been exceeding- \nly strained. Erm61ov had been to see Bennig- \nsen a few days previously and had entreated \nhim to use his influence with the commander \nin chief to induce him to take the offensive. \n\n"If I did not know you I should think you \ndid not want what you are asking for. I need \nonly advise anything and his Highness is sure \nto do the opposite," replied Bennigsen. \n\nThe Cossack's report, confirmed by horse \npatrols who were sent out, was the final proof \nthat events had matured. The tightly coiled \nspring was released, the clock began to whirr \nand the chimes to play. Despite all his sup- \nposed power, his intellect, his experience, and \nhis knowledge of men, Kutiizov having taken \ninto consideration the Cossack's report, a note \nfrom Bennigsen who sent personal reports to \nthe Emperor, the wishes he supposed the Em- \nperor to hold, and the fact that all the generals \nexpressed the same wishcould no longer check \nthe inevitable movement, and gave the order \nto do what he regarded as useless and harmful \ngave his approval, that is, to the accomplished \nfact. \n\nCHAPTER IV \n\nBKNNIGSEN'S NOTE and the Cossack's informa- \ntion that the left flank of the French was un- \nguarded were merely final indications that it \nwas necessary to order an attack, and it was \nfixed for the fifth of October. \n\nOn the morning of the fourth of October \nKutuzov signed the dispositions. Toll read \nthem to Erm61ov, asking him to attend to the \nfurther arrangements. \n\n"All right all right. I haven't time just now," \nreplied Erm61ov, and left the hut. \n\nThe dispositions drawn up by Toll were very \n\n\n\nBOOK THIRTEEN \n\ngood. As in the Austerlitz dispositions, it was \nwrittenthough not in German this time: \n\n"The First Column will march here and \nhere," "the Second Column will march there \nand there," and so on; and on paper, all these \ncolumns arrived at their places at the appointed \ntime and destroyed the enemy. Everything had \nbeen admirably thought out as is usual in dis- \npositions, and as is always the case, not a single \ncolumn reached its place at the appointed \ntime. \n\nWhen the necessary number of copies of the \ndispositions had been prepared, an officer was \nsummoned and sent to deliver them to Ermo- \nlov to deal with. A young officer of the Horse \nGuards, Kutuzov's orderly, pleased at the im- \nportance of the mission entrusted to him, went \nto Erm61ov's quarters. \n\n"Gone away," said Erm61ov's orderly. \n\nThe officer of the Horse Guards went to a \ngeneral with whom Ermolov was often to be \nfound. \n\n"No, and the general's out too." \n\nThe officer, mounting his horse, rode off to \nsomeone else. \n\n"No, he's gone out." \n\n"If only they don't make me responsible for \nthis delay! What a nuisance it is!" thought the \nofficer, and he rode round the whole camp. \nOne man said he had seen Erm61ov ride past \nwith some other generals, others said he must \nhave returned home. The officer searched till \nsix o'clock in the evening without even stop- \nping to eat. Ermolov was nowhere to be found \nand no one knew where he was. The officer \nsnatched a little food at a comrade's, and rode \nagain to the vanguard to find Miloradovich. \nMilorddovich too was away, but here he was \ntold that he had gone to a ball at General Ki- \nkin's and that Erm61ov was probably there \ntoo. \n\n"But where is it?" \n\n"Why, there, over at Echkino," said a Cos- \nsack officer, pointing to a country house in the \nfar distance. \n\n"What, outside our line?" \n\n"They've put two regiments as outposts, and \nthey're having such a spree there, it's awful 1 \nTwo bands and three sets of singers!" \nf The officer rode out beyond our lines to \nEchkino. While still at a distance he heard as \nhe rode the merry sounds of a soldier's dance \nsong proceeding from the house. \n\n"In the meadows ... in the meadows!" he \nheard, accompanied by whistling and the sound \nof a torban, drowned every now and then by \n\n\n\n567 \n\nshouts. These sounds made his spirits rise, but \nat the same time he was afraid that he would \nbe blamed for not having executed sooner the \nimportant order entrusted to him. It was al- \nready past eight o'clock. He dismounted and \nwent up into the porch of a large country \nhouse which had remained intact between the \nRussian and French forces. In the refreshment \nroom and the hall, footmen were bustling \nabout with wine and viands. Groups of singers \nstood outside the windows. The officer was ad- \nmitted and immediately saw all the chief gen- \nerals of the army together, and among them \nErmolov's big imposing figure. They all had \ntheir coats unbuttoned and were standing in a \nsemicircle with flushed and animated faces, \nlaughing loudly. In the middle of the room a \nshort handsome general with a red face was \ndancing the trepdk with much spirit and agil- \nity. \n\n"Ha, ha, ha! Bravo, Nicholas Ivdnych! Ha, \nha, ha!" \n\nThe officer felt that by arriving with impor- \ntant orders at such a moment he was doubly to \nblame, and he would have preferred to wait; \nbut one of the generals espied him and, hear- \ning what he had come about, informed Erm6- \nlov. \n\nErmolov came forward with a frown on his \nface and, hearing what the officer had to say, \ntook the papers from him without a word. \n\n"You think he went off just by chance?" said \na comrade, who was on the staff that evening, \nto the officer of the Horse Guards, referring to \nErmolov. "It was a trick. It was done on pur- \npose to get Konovnitsyn into trouble. You'll \nsee what a mess there'll be tomorrow." \n\nCHAPTER V \n\nNEXT DAY the decrepit Kutiizov, having given \norders to be called early, said his prayers, \ndressed, and, with an unpleasant consciousness \nof having to direct a battle he did not approve \nof, got into his caleche and drove from Leta- \nsh6vka (a village three and a half miles from \nTariitino) to the place where the attacking \ncolumns were to meet. He sat in the caltche, \ndozing and waking up by turns, and listening \nfor any sound of firing on the right as an indi- \ncation that the action had begun. But all was \nstill quiet. A damp dull autumn morning was \njust dawning. On approaching Tariitino Ku- \ntiizov noticed cavalrymen leading their horses \nto water across the road along which he was \ndriving. Kutiizov looked at them searchingly, \n\n\n\n568 \n\nstopped his carriage, and inquired what regi- \nment they belonged to. They belonged to a \ncolumn that should have been far in front and \nin ambush long before then. "It may be a mis- \ntake," thought the old commander in chief. \nBut a little further on he saw infantry regi- \nments with their arms piled and the soldiers, \nonly partly dressed, eating their rye porridge \nand carrying fuel. He sent for an officer. The \nofficer reported that no order to advance had \nbeen received. \n\n"How! Not rec . . ." Kutuzov began, but \nchecked himself immediately and sent for a \nsenior officer. Getting out of his caltche, he \nwaited with drooping head and breathing \nheavily, pacing silently up and down. When \nEfkhen, the officer of the general staff whom \nhe had summoned, appeared, Kutuzov went \npurple in the face, not because that officer was \nto blame for the mistake, but because he was \nan object of sufficient importance for him to \nvent his wrath on. Trembling and panting the \nold man fell into that state of fury in which he \nsometimes used to roll on the ground, and he \nfell upon Eykhen, threatening him with his \nhands, shouting and loading him with gross \nabuse. Another man, Captain Br6zin, who hap- \npened to turn up and who was not at all to \nblame, suffered the same fate. \n\n"What sort of another blackguard are you? \nI'll have you shot! Scoundrels!" yelled Kutu- \nzov in a hoarse voice, waving his arms and reel- \ning. \n\nHe was suffering physically. He, the com- \nmander in chief, a Serene Highness who every- \nbody said possessed powers such as no man had \never had in Russia, to be placed in this posi- \ntionmade the laughingstock of the whole ar- \nmy! "I needn't have been in such a hurry to \npray about today, or have kept awake think- \ning everything over all night," thought he to \nhimself. "When I was a chit of an officer no \none would have dared to mock me so ... and \nnow!" He was in a state of physical suffering \nas if from corporal punishment, and could not \navoid expressing it by cries of anger and dis- \ntress. But his strength soon began to fail him, \nand looking about him, conscious of having \nsaid much that was amiss, he again got into his \ncaliche and drove back in silence. \n\nHis wrath, once expended, did not return, \nand blinking feebly he listened to excuses and \nself-justifications (Erm61ov did not come to \nsee him till the next day) and to the insistence \nof Bennigsen, Konovnitsyn, and Toll that the \nmovement that had miscarried should be exe- \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\ncuted next day. And once more Kutiizov had \nto consent. \n\nCHAPTER VI \n\nNEXT DAY the troops assembled in their ap- \npointed places in the evening and advanced \nduring the night. It was an autumn night with \ndark purple clouds, but no rain. The ground \nwas damp but not muddy, and the troops ad- \nvanced noiselessly, only occasionally a jingling \nof the artillery could be faintly heard. The \nmen were forbidden to talk out loud, to smoke \ntheir pipes, or to strike a light, and they tried \nto prevent their horses neighing. The secrecy \nof the undertaking heightened its charm and \nthey marched gaily. Some columns, supposing \nthey had reached their destination, halted, \npiled arms, and settled down on the cold \nground, but the majority marched all night \nand arrived at places where they evidently \nshould not have been. \n\nOnly Count Orlov-Denisov with his Cos- \nsacks (the least important detachment of all) \ngot to his appointed place at the right time. \nThis detachment halted at the outskirts of a \nforest, on the path leading from the village of \nStromilova to Dmftrovsk. \n\nToward dawn, Count Orlov-Denfsov, who \nhad dozed off, was awakened by a deserter from \nthe French army being brought to him. This \nwas a Polish sergeant of Poniatowski's corps, \nwho explained in Polish that he had come \nover because he had been slighted in the serv- \nice: that he ought long ago to have been made \nan officer, that he was braver than any of them, \nand so he had left them and wished to pay \nthem out. He said that Murat was spending \nthe night less than a mile from where they \nwere, and that if they would let him have a \nconvoy of a hundred men he would capture \nhim alive. Count Orl6v-Denfsov consulted his \nfellow officers. \n\nThe offer was too tempting to be refused. \nEveryone volunteered to go and everybody ad- \nvised making the attempt. After much disput- \ning and arguing, Major-General Grkov with \ntwo Cossack regiments decided to go with the \nPolish sergeant. \n\n"Now, remember," said Count Orl6v-Denf- \nsov to the sergeant at parting, "if you have \nbeen lying I'll have you hanged like a dog; but \nif it's true you shall have a hundred gold \npieces!" \n\nWithout replying, the sergeant, with a reso- \nlute air, mounted and rode away with Grkov \nwhose men had quickly assembled. They dis- \n\n\n\nBOOK THIRTEEN \n\n\n\n569 \n\n\n\nappeared into the forest, and Count Orl6v- \nDenfsov, having seen Grkov off, returned, \nshivering from the freshness of the early dawn \nand excited by what he had undertaken on his \nown responsibility, and began looking at the \nenemy camp, now just visible in the deceptive \nlight of dawn and the dying campfires. Our \ncolumns ought to have begun to appear on an \nopen declivity to his right. He looked in that \ndirection, but though the columns would have \nbeen visible quite far off, they were not to be \nseen. It seemed to the count that things were \nbeginning to stir in the French camp, and his \nkeen-sighted adjutant confirmed this. \n\n"Oh, it is really too late," said Count Orl6v, \nlooking at the camp. \n\nAs often happens when someone we have \ntrusted is no longer before our eyes, it sudden- \nly seemed quite clear and obvious to him that \nthe sergeant was an impostor, that he had lied, \nand that the whole Russian attack would be \nruined by the absence of those two regiments, \nwhich he would lead away heaven only knew \nwhere. How could one capture a commander \nin chief from among such a mass of troops! \n\n"I am sure that rascal was lying," said the \ncount. \n\n"They can still be called back," said one of \nhis suite, who like Count Orlov felt distrustful \nof the adventure when he looked at the en- \nemy's camp. \n\n"Eh? Really . . . what do you think? Should \nwe let them go on or not?" \n\n"Will you have them fetched back?" \n\n"Fetch them back, fetch them backl" said \nCount Orlov with sudden determination, look- \ning at his watch. "It will be too late. It is quite \nlight." \n\nAnd the adjutant galloped through the \nforest after Grkov. When Grkov returned, \nCount Orl6v-Denfsov, excited both by the \nabandoned attempt and by vainly awaiting the \ninfantry columns that still did not appear, as \nwell as by the proximity of the enemy, resolved \nto advance. All his men felt the same excite- \nment. \n\n"Mountl" he commanded in a whisper. The \nmen took their places and crossed themselves. \n. . . "Forward, with God's aid!" \n\n"Hurrah-ah-ahl" reverberated in the forest, \nand the Cossack companies, trailing their \nlances and advancing one after another as if \npoured out of a sack, dashed gaily across the \nbrook toward the camp. \n\nOne desperate, frightened yell from the first \nFrench soldier who saw the Cossacks, and all \n\n\n\nwho were in the camp, undressed and only just \nwaking up, ran off in all directions, abandon- \ning cannons, muskets, and horses. \n\nHad the Cossacks pursued the French, with- \nout heeding what was behind and around \nthem, they would have captured Murat and \neverything there. That was what the officers \ndesired. But it was impossible to make the Cos- \nsacks budge when once they had got booty and \nprisoners. None of them listened to orders. \nFifteen hundred prisoners and thirty-eight \nguns were taken on the spot, besides standards \nand (what seemed most important to the Cos- \nsacks) horses, saddles, horsecloths, and the like. \nAll this had to be dealt with, the prisoners and \nguns secured, the booty divided not without \nsome shouting and even a little fighting among \nthemselves and it was on this that the Cos- \nsacks all busied themselves. \n\nThe French, not being farther pursued, be- \ngan to recover themselves: they formed into \ndetachments and began firing. Orl6v-Denisov, \nstill waiting for the other columns to arrive, \nadvanced no further. \n\nMeantime, according to the dispositions \nwhich said that "the First Column will march" \nand so on, the infantry of the belated columns, \ncommanded by Bennigsen and directed by Toll, \nhad started in due order and, as always hap- \npens, had got somewhere, but not to their ap- \npointed places. As always happens the men, \nstarting cheerfully, began to halt; murmurs \nwere heard, there was a sense of confusion, and \nfinally a backward movement. Adjutants and \ngenerals galloped about, shouted, grew angry, \nquarreled, said they had come quite wrong and \nwere late, gave vent to a little abuse, and at \nlast gave it all up and went forward, simply to \nget somewhere. "We shall get somewhere or \nother!" And they did indeed get somewhere, \nthough not to their right places; a few even- \ntually even got to their right place, but too \nlate to be of any use and only in time to be \nfired at. Toll, who in this battle played the \npart of Weyrother at Austerlitz, galloped as- \nsiduously from place to place, finding every- \nthing upside down everywhere. Thus he stum- \nbled on Bagovut's corps in a wood when it was \nalready broad daylight, though the corps should \nlong before have joined Orl6v-Denisov. Ex- \ncited and vexed by the failure and supposing \nthat someone must be responsible for it, Toll \ngalloped up to the commander of the corps \nand began upbraiding him severely, saying that \nhe ought to be shot. General Bagoviit, a fight- \ning old soldier of placid temperament, being \n\n\n\n57&lt;&gt; \n\nalso upset by all the delay, confusion, and \ncross-purposes, fell into a rage to everybody's \nsurprise and quite contrary to his usual char- \nacter and said disagreeable things to Toll. \n\n"I prefer not to take lessons from anyone, \nbut I can die with my men as well as anybody," \nhe said, and advanced with a single division. \n\nComing out onto a field under the enemy's \nfire, this brave general went straight ahead, \nleading his men under fire, without consider- \ning in his agitation whether going into action \nnow, with a single division, would be of any \nuse or no. Danger, cannon balls, and bullets \nwere just what he needed in his angry mood. \nOne of the first bullets killed him, and other \nbullets killed many of his men. And his divi- \nsion remained under fire for some time quite \nuselessly. \n\nCHAPTER VII \n\nMEANWHILE ANOTHER COLUMN was to have at- \ntacked the French from the front, but Kutu \nzov accompanied that column. He well knew \nthat nothing but confusion would come of this \nbattle undertaken against his will, and as far \nas was in his power held the troops back. He \ndid not advance. \n\nHe rode silently on his small gray horse, in- \ndolently answering suggestions that they should \nattack. \n\n"The word attack is always on your tongue, \nbut you don't see that we are unable to execute \ncomplicated maneuvers," said he to Milora- \ndovich who asked permission to advance. \n\n"We couldn't take Murat prisoner this morn- \ning or get to the place in time, and nothing \ncan be done now!" he replied to someone else. \n\nWhen Kutuzov was informed that at the \nFrench rear where according to the reports \nof the Cossacks there had previously been no- \nbodythere were now two battalions of Poles, \nhe gave a sidelong glance at Erm61ov who was \nbehind him and to whom he had not spoken \nsince the previous day. \n\n"You see! They are asking to attack and mak- \ning plans of all kinds, but as soon as one gets \nto business nothing is ready, and the enemy, \nforewarned, takes measures accordingly." \n\nErm61ov screwed up his eyes and smiled \nfaintly on hearing these words. He understood \nthat for him the storm had blown over, and \nthat Kutuzov would content himself with that \nhint. \n\n"He's having a little fun at my expense/' \nsaid Ermolov softly, nudging with his knee \nRaevski who was at his side. \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\nSoon after this, Erm61ov moved up to Kutu- \nzov and respectfully remarked: \n\n"It is not too late yet, your Highnessthe \nenemy has not gone away if you were to or- \nder an attack! If not, the Guards will not so \nmuch as see a little smoke." \n\nKutuzov did not reply, but when they re- \nported to him that Murat's troops were in re- \ntreat he ordered an advance, though at every \nhundred paces he halted for three quarters of \nan hour. \n\nThe whole battle consisted in what Orl6v- \nDenisov's Cossacks had done: the rest of the \narmy merely lost some hundreds of men use- \nlessly. \n\nIn consequence of this battle Kutuzov re- \nceived a dianiond decoration, and Bennigsen \nsome diamonds and a hundred thousand ru- \nbles, others also received pleasant recognitions \ncorresponding to their various grades, and fol- \nlowing the battle fresh changes were made in \nthe staff. \n\n"That's how everything is done with us, all \ntopsy-turvy!" said the Russian officers and gen- \nerals after the Tarutino battle, letting it be \nunderstood that some fool there is doing things \nall wrong but that we ourselves should not have \ndone so, just as people speak today. But peo- \nple who talk like that either do not know what \nthey are talking about or deliberately deceive \nthemselves. No battle Tarutino, Borodin6, or \nAusterlitz takes place as those who planned \nit anticipated. That is an essential condition. \n. A countless number of free forces (for no- \nwhere is man freer than during a battle, where \nit is a question of life and death) influence the \ncourse taken by the fight, and that course nev- \ner can be known in advance and never coin- \ncides with the direction of any one force. \n\nIf many simultaneously and variously di- \nrected forces act on a given body, the direction \nof its motion cannot coincide with any one of \nthose forces, but will always be a mean what \nin mechanics is represented by the diagonal of \na parallelogram of forces. \n\nIf in the descriptions given by historians, \nespecially French ones, we find their wars and \nbattles carried out in accordance with previ- \nously formed plans, the only conclusion to be \ndrawn is that those descriptions are false. \n\nThe battle of Tariitino obviously did not \nattain the aim Toll had in view to lead the \ntroops into action in the order prescribed by \nthe dispositions; nor that which Count Orl6v- \nDenisov may have had in view to take Murat \nprisoner; nor the result of immediately de- \n\n\n\nBOOK THIRTEEN \n\nstroying the whole corps, which Bennigsen and \nothers may have had in view; nor the aim of \nthe officer who wished to go into action to dis- \ntinguish himself; nor that of the Cossack who \nwanted more booty than he got, and so on. But \nif the aim of the battle was what actually re- \nsulted and what all the Russians of that day \ndesired to drive the French out of Russia and \ndestroy their army it is quite clear that the \nbattle of Tanitino, just because of its incon- \ngruities, was exactly what was wanted at that \nstage of the campaign. It would be difficult \nand even impossible to imagine any result more \nopportune than the actual outcome of this bat- \ntle. With a minimum of effort and insignifi- \ncant losses, despite the greatest confusion, the \nmost important results of the whole campaign \nwere attained: the transition from retreat to \nadvance, an exposure of the weakness of the \nFrdnch, and the administration of that shock \nwhich Napoleon's army had only awaited to \nbegin its flight. \n\n\n\n57* \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII \n\nNAPOLEON ENTERS Moscow after the brilliant \nvictory de la Moskowa; there can be no doubt \nabout the victory for the battlefield remains in \nthe hands of the French. The Russians retreat \nand abandon their ancient capital. Moscow, \nabounding in provisions, arms, munitions, and \nincalculable wealth, is in Napoleon's hands. \nThe Russian army, only half the strength of \nthe French, does not make a single attempt to \nattack for a whole month. Napoleon's position \nis most brilliant. He can either fall on the Rus- \nsian army with double its strength and destroy \nit; negotiate an advantageous peace, or in case \nof a refusal make a menacing move on Peters- \nburg, or even, in the case of a reverse, return \nto Smolensk or Vflna; or remain in Moscow; \nin short, no special genius would seem to be \nrequired to retain the brilliant position the \nFrench held at that time. For that, only very \nsimple and easy steps were necessary: not to \nallow the troops to loot, to prepare winter \nclothing of which there was sufficient in Mos- \ncow for the whole army and methodically to \ncollect the provisions, of which (according to \nthe French historians) there were enough in \nMoscow to supply the whole army for six \nmonths. Yet Napoleon, that greatest of all \ngeniuses, who the historians declare had con- \ntrol of the army, took none of these steps. \n\nHe not merely did nothing of the kind, but \non the contrary he used his power to select the \nmost foolish and ruinous of all the courses \n\n\n\nopen to him. Of all that Napoleon might have \ndone: wintering in Moscow, advancing on \nPetersburg or on Nizhni-N6vgorod, or retiring \nby a more northerly or more southerly route \n(say by the road Kuttizov afterwards took), \nnothing more stupid or disastrous can be im- \nagined than what he actually did. He remained \nin Moscow till October, letting the troops \nplunder the city; then, hesitating whether to \nleave a garrison behind him, he quitted Mos- \ncow, approached Kutuzov without joining bat- \ntle, turned to the right and reached Malo- \nYarosldvets, again without attempting to break \nthrough and take the road Kutuzov took, but \nretiring instead to Mozhdysk along the dev- \nastated Smolensk road. Nothing more stupid \nthan that could have been devised, or more \ndisastrous for the army, as the sequel showed. \nHad Napoleon's aim been to destroy his army, \nthe most skillful strategist could hardly have \ndevised any series of actions that would so com- \npletely have accomplished that purpose, inde- \npendently of anything the Russian army might \ndo. \n\nNapoleon, the man of genius, did this! But \nto say that he destroyed his army because he \nwished to, or because he was very stupid, would \nbe as unjust as to say that he had brought his \ntroops to Moscow because he wished to and be- \ncause he was very clever and a genius. \n\nIn both cases his personal activity, having \nno more force than the personal activity of \nany soldier, merely coincided with the laws \nthat guided the event. \n\nThe historians quite falsely represent Na- \npoleon's faculties as having weakened in Mos- \ncow, and do so only because the results did \nnot justify his actions. He employed all his \nability and strength to do the best he could for \nhimself and his army, as he had done previous- \nly and as he did subsequently in 1813. His ac- \ntivity at that time was no less astounding than \nit was in Egypt, in Italy, in Austria, and in \nPrussia. We do not know for certain in how \nfar his genius was genuine in Egypt where \nforty centuries looked down upon his grandeur \nfor his great exploits there are all told us by \nFrenchmen. We cannot accurately estimate his \ngenius in Austria or Prussia, for we have to \ndraw our information from French or German \nsources, and the incomprehensible surrender \nof whole corps without fighting and of for- \ntresses without a siege must incline Germans \nto recognize his genius as the only explanation \nof the war carried on in Germany. But we, \nthank God, kave no need to recognize his gen- \n\n\n\n57* \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nius in order to hide our shame. We have paid \nfor the right to look at the matter plainly and \nsimply, and we will not abandon that right. \n\nHis activity in Moscow was as amazing and \nas full of genius as elsewhere. Order after or- \nder and plan after plan were issued by him \nfrom the time he entered Moscow till the time \nhe left it. The absence of citizens and of a dep- \nutation, and even the burning of Moscow, \ndid not disconcert him. He did not lose sight \neither of the welfare of his army or of the do- \nings of the enemy, or of the welfare of the peo- \nple of Russia, or of the direction of affairs in \nParis, or of diplomatic considerations con- \ncerning the terms of the anticipated peace. \n\nCHAPTER IX \n\nWITH REGARD to military matters, Napoleon \nimmediately on his entry into Moscow gave \nGeneral Sabastiani strict orders to observe the \nmovements of the Russian army, sent army \ncorps out along the different roads, and charged \nMurat to find Kutuzov. Then he gave careful \ndirections about the fortification of the Kre*m- \nlin, and drew up a brilliant plan for a future \ncampaign over the whole map of Russia. \n\nWith regard to diplomatic questions, Napo- \nleon summoned Captain Yakovlev, who had \nbeen robbed and was in rags and did not know \nhow to get out of Moscow, minutely explained \nto him his whole policy and his magnanimity, \nand having written a letter to the Emperor \nAlexander in which he considered it his duty \nto inform his Friend and Brother that Rostop- \nchin had managed affairs badly in Moscow, he \ndispatched Ydkovlev to Petersburg. \n\nHaving similarly explained his views and his \nmagnanimity to Tut61min, he dispatched that \nold man also to Petersburg to negotiate. \n\nWith regard to legal matters, immediately \nafter the fires he gave orders to find and exe- \ncute'the incendiaries. And the scoundrel Ros- \ntopchfn was punished by an order to burn \ndown his houses. \n\nWith regard to administrative matters, Mos- \ncow was granted a constitution. A municipality \nwas established and the following announce- \nment issued: \n\nINHABITANTS OF MOSCOW! \nYour misfortunes are cruel, but His Majesty the \nEmperor and King desires to arrest their course. \nTerrible examples have taught you how he pun- \nishes disobedience and crime. Strict measures have \nbeen taken to put an end to disorder and to re- \nestablish public security. A paternal administra- \ntion, chosen from among yourselves, will form \n\n\n\nyour municipality or city government. It will take \ncare of you, of your needs, and of your welfare. Its \nmembers will be distinguished by a red ribbon \nworn across the shoulder, and the mayor of the \ncity will wear a white belt as well. But when not \non duty they will only wear a red ribbon round \nthe left arm. \n\nThe city police is established on its former foot- \ning, and better order already prevails in conse- \nquence of its activity. The government has ap- \npointed two commissaries general, or chiefs of \npolice, and twenty commissaries or captains of \nwards have been appointed to the different wards \nof the city. You will recognize them by the white \nribbon they will wear on the left arm. Several \nchurches of different denominations are open, and \ndivine service is performed in them unhindered. \nYour fellow citizens are returning every day to \ntheir homes, and orders have been given that they \nshould find in them the help and protection due \nto their misfortunes. These are the measures the \ngovernment has adopted to re-establish order and \nrelieve your condition. But to achieve this aim it is \nnecessary that you should add your efforts and \nshould, if possible, forget the misfortunes you have \nsuffered, should entertain the hope of a less cruel \nfate, should be certain that inevitable and ignomin- \nious death awaits those who make any attempt \non your persons or on what remains of your prop- \nerty, and finally that you should not doubt that \nthese will be safeguarded, since such is the will of \nthe greatest and most just of monarchs. Soldiers and \ncitizens, of whatever nation you may be, re-estab- \nlish public confidence, the source of the welfare of \na state, live like brothers, render mutual aid and \nprotection one to another, unite to defeat the in- \ntentions of the evil-minded, obey the military and \ncivil authorities, and your tears will soon cease to \nflow! \n\nWith regard to supplies for the army, Napo- \nleon decreed that all the troops in turn should \nenter Moscow d la maraude * to obtain provi- \nsions for themselves, so that the army might \nhave its future provided for. \n\nWith regard to religion, Napoleon ordered \nthe priests to be brought back and services to \nbe again performed in the churches. \n\nWith regard to commerce and to provision- \ning the army, the following was placarded \neverywhere: \n\nPROCLAMATION \n\nYou, peaceful inhabitants of Moscow, artisans \nand workmen whom misfortune has driven from \nthe city, and you scattered tillers of the soil, still \nkept out in the fields by groundless fear, listen! \nTranquillity is returning to this capital and order \nis being restored in it. Your fellow countrymen are \nemerging boldly from their hiding places on find- \n\n1 As looters. \n\n\n\nBOOK THIRTEEN \n\n\n\n57S \n\n\n\ning that they are respected. Any violence to them \nor to their property is promptly punished. His \nMajesty the Emperor and King protects them, and \nconsiders no one among you his enemy except \nthose who disobey his orders. He desires to end \nyour misfortunes and restore you to your homes \nand families. Respond, therefore, to his benevolent \nintentions and come to us without fear. Inhabi- \ntants, return with confidence to your abodes! You \nwill soon find means of satisfying your needs. \nCraftsmen and industrious artisans, return to your \nwork, your houses, your shops, where the protec- \ntion of guards awaits you! You shall receive proper \npay for your work. And lastly you too, peasants, \ncome from the forests where you are hiding in \nterror, return to your huts without fear, in full \nassurance that you will find protection! Markets \nare established in the city where peasants can bring \ntheir surplus supplies and the products of the soil. \nThe government has taken the following steps to \nensure freedom of sale for them: (i) From today, \npeasants, husbandmen, and those living in the \nneighborhood of Moscow may without any danger \nbring their supplies of all kinds to two appointed \nmarkets, of which one is on the Mokhovaya Street \nand the other at the Provision Market. (2) Such \nsupplies will be bought from them at such prices \nas seller and buyer may agree on, and if a seller \nis unable to obtain a fair price he will be free to \ntake his goods back to his village and no one may \nhinder him under any pretense. (3) Sunday and \nWednesday of each week are appointed as the chief \nmarket days and to that end a sufficient number of \ntroops will be stationed along the highroads on \nTuesdays and Saturdays at such distances from the \ntown as to protect the carts. (4) Similar measures \nwill be taken that peasants with their carts and \nhorses may meet with no hindrance on their re- \nturn journey. (5) Steps will immediately be taken \nto re-establish ordinary trading. \n\nInhabitants of the city and villages, and you, \nworkingmen and artisans, to whatever nation you \nbelong, you are called on to carry out the paternal \nintentions of His Majesty the Emperor and King \nand to co-operate with him for the public welfare! \nLay your respect and confidence at his feet and do \nnot delay to unite with us! \n\nWith the object of raising the spirits of the \ntroops and of the people, reviews were con- \nstantly held and rewards distributed. The Em- \nperor rode through the streets to comfort the \ninhabitants, and, despite his preoccupation \nwith state affairs, himself visited the theaters \nthat were established by his order. \n\nIn regard to philanthropy, the greatest vir- \ntue of crowned heads, Napoleon also did all in \nhis power. He caused the words Maison de ma \nM&amp;re to be inscribed on the charitable institu- \ntions, thereby combining tender filial affection \nwith the majestic benevolence of a monarch. \n\n\n\nHe visited the Foundling Hospital and, allow- \ning the orphans saved by him to kiss his white \nhands, graciously conversed with Tutolmin. \nThen, as Thiers eloquently recounts, he or- \ndered his soldiers to be paid in forged Russian \nmoney which he had prepared: "Raising the \nuse of these means by an act worthy of himself \nand of the French army, he let relief be dis- \ntributed to those who had been burned out. \nBut as food was too precious to be given to \nforeigners, who were for the most part ene- \nmies, Napoleon preferred to supply them with \nmoney with which to purchase food from out- \nside, and had paper rubles distributed to them." \nWith reference to army discipline, orders \nwere continually being issued to inflict severe \npunishment for the non performance of mili- \ntary duties and to suppress robbery. \n\nCHAPTER X \n\nBUT STRANGE TO SAY, all these measures, efforts, \nand plans which were not at all worse than \nothers issued in similar circumstances did not \naffect the essence of the matter but, like the \nhands of a clock detached from the mechanism, \nswung about in an arbitrary and aimless way \nwithout engaging the cogwheels. \n\nWith reference to the military side the plan \nof campaign that work of genius of which \nThiers remarks that, "His genius never de- \nvised anything more profound, more skillful, \nor more admirable," and enters into a polemic \nwith M. Fain to prove that this work of genius \nmust be referred not to the fourth but to the \nfifteenth of October that plan never was or \ncould be executed, for it was quite out of \ntouch with the facts of the case. The fortifying \nof the Kremlin, for which la Mosqute (as Na- \npoleon termed the church of Basil the Beati- \nfied) was to have been razed to the ground, \nproved quite useless. The mining of the Krm- \nlin only helped toward fulfilling Napoleon's \nwish that it should be blown up when he left \nMoscow as a child wants the floor on which \nhe has hurt himself to be beaten. The pursuit \nof the Russian army, about which Napoleon \nwas so concerned, produced an unheard-of re- \nsult. The French generals lost touch with the \nRussian army of sixty thousand men, and ac- \ncording to Thiers it was only eventually found, \nlike a lost pin, by the skilland apparently the \ngenius of Murat. \n\nWith reference to diplomacy, all Napoleon's \narguments as to his magnanimity and justice, \nboth to Tut61min and to Ykovlev (whose \nchief concern was to obtain a greatcoat and a \n\n\n\n574 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nconveyance), proved useless; Alexander did \nnot receive these envoys and did not reply to \ntheir embassage. \n\nWith regard to legal matters, after the exe- \ncution of the supposed incendiaries the rest of \nMoscow burned down. \n\nWith regard to administrative matters, the \nestablishment of a municipality did not stop \nthe robberies and was only of use to certain \npeople who formed part of that municipality \nand under pretext of preserving order looted \nMoscow or saved their own property from be- \ning looted. \n\nWith regard to religion, as to which in Egypt \nmatters had so easily been settled by Napo- \nleon's visit to a mosque, no results were \nachieved. Two or three priests who were found \nin Moscow did try to carry out Napoleon's \nwish, but one of them was slapped in the face \nby a French soldier while conducting service, \nand a French official reported of another that: \n"The priest whom I found and invited to say \nMass cleaned and locked up the church. That \nnight the doors were again broken open, the \npadlocks smashed, the books mutilated, and \nother disorders perpetrated." \n\nWith reference to commerce, the proclama- \ntion to industrious workmen and to peasants \nevoked no response. There were no industri- \nous workmen, and the peasants caught the com- \nmissaries who ventured too far out of town \nwith the proclamation and killed them. \n\nAs to the theaters for the entertainment of \nthe people and the troops, these did not meet \nwith success either. The theaters set up in the \nKremlin and in Posnyakov's house were closed \nagain at once because the actors and actresses \nwere robbed. \n\nEven philanthropy did not have the desired \neffect. The genuine as well as the false paper \nmoney which flooded Moscow lost its value. \nThe French, collecting booty, cared only for \ngold. Not only was the paper money valueless \nwhich Napoleon so graciously distributed to \nthe unfortunate, but even silver lost its value \nin relation to gold. \n\nBut the most amazing example of the inef- \nfectiveness of the orders given by the authori- \nties at that time was Napoleon's attempt to \nstop the looting and re-establish discipline. \n\nThis is what the army authorities were re- \nporting: \n\n"Looting continues in the city despite the \ndecrees against it. Order is not yet restored and \nnot a single merchant is carrying on trade in a \nlawful manner. The sutlers alone venture to \n\n\n\ntrade, and they sell stolen goods." \n\n"The neighborhood of my ward continues \nto be pillaged by soldiers of the $rd Corps \nwho, not satisfied with taking from the unfor- \ntunate inhabitants hiding in the cellars the \nlittle they have left, even have the ferocity to \nwound them with their sabers, as I have re- \npeatedly witnessed." \n\n"Nothing new, except that the soldiers are \nrobbing and pillaging October 9." \n\n"Robbery and pillaging continue. There is \na band of thieves in our district who ought to \nbe arrested by a strong force October 1 1." \n\n"The Emperor is extremely displeased that \ndespite the strict orders to stop pillage, parties \nof marauding Guards are continually seen re- \nturning to the Kremlin. Among the Old Guard \ndisorder and pillage were renewed more vio- \nlently than ever yesterday evening, last night, \nand today. The Emperor sees with regret that \nthe picked soldiers appointed to guard his per- \nson, who should set an example of discipline, \ncarry disobedience to such a point that they \nbreak into the cellars and stores containing \narmy supplies. Others have disgraced them- \nselves to the extent of disobeying sentinels and \nofficers, and have abused and beaten them." \n\n"The Grand Marshal of the palace," wrote \nthe governor, "complains bitterly that in spite \nof repeated orders, the soldiers continue to \ncommit nuisances in all the courtyards and \neven under the very windows of the Emperor." \n\nThat army, like a herd of cattle run wild \nand trampling underfoot the provender which \nmight have saved it from starvation, disinte- \ngrated and perished with each additional day \nit remained in Moscow. But it did not go away. \n\nIt began to run away only when suddenly \nseized by a panic caused by the capture of trans- \nport trains on the Smolensk road, and by the \nbattle of Tanitino. The news of that battle of \nTarutino, unexpectedly received by Napoleon \nat a review, evoked in him a desire to punish \nthe Russians (Thiers says), and he issued the \norder for departure which the whole army was \ndemanding. \n\nFleeing from Moscow the soldiers took with \nthem everything they had stolen. Napoleon, \ntoo, carried away his own personal trdsor, but \non seeing the baggage trains that impeded the \narmy, he was (Thiers says) horror-struck. And \nyet with his experience of war he did not order \nall the superfluous vehicles to be burned, as he \nhad done with those of a certain marshal when \napproaching Moscow. He gazed at the caliches \nand carriages in which soldiers were riding and \n\n\n\nBOOK THIRTEEN \n\nremarked that it was a very good thing, as those \nvehicles could be used to carry provisions, the \nsick, and the wounded. \n\nThe plight of the whole army resembled \nthat of a wounded animal which feels it is per- \nishing and does not know what it is doing. To \nstudy the skillful tactics and aims of Napoleon \nand his army from the time it entered Moscow \ntill it was destroyed is like studying the dying \nleaps and shudders of a mortally wounded ani- \nmal. Very often a wounded animal, hearing a \nrustle, rushes straight at the hunter's gun, runs \nforward and back again, and hastens its own \nend. Napoleon, under pressure from his whole \narmy, did the same thing. The rustle of the \nbattle of Tarutino frightened the beast, and it \nrushed forward onto the hunter's gun, reached \nhim, turned back, and finally like any wild \nbeast ran back along the most disadvanta- \ngeous and dangerous path, where the old scent \nwas familiar. \n\nDuring the whole of that period Napoleon, \nwho seems to us to have been the leader of all \nthese movements as the figurehead of a ship \nmay seem to a savage to guide the vessel acted \nlike a child who, holding a couple of strings \ninside a carriage, thinks he is driving it. \n\n\n\n575 \n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI \n\nEARLY IN THE MORNING of the sixth of October \nPierre went out of the shed, and on returning \nstopped by the door to play with a little blue- \ngray dog, with a long body and short bandy \nlegs, that jumped about him. This little dog \nlived in their shed, sleeping beside Karatacv at \nnight; it sometimes made excursions into the \ntown but always returned again. Probably it \nhad never had an owner, and it still belonged \nto nobody and had no name. The French called \nit Azor; the soldier who told stories called it \nFemgalka; Karataev and others called it Gray, \nor sometimes Flabby. Its lack of a master, a \nname, or even of a breed or any definite color \ndid not seem to trouble the blue-gray dog in \nthe least. Its furry tail stood up firm and round \nas a plume, its bandy legs served it so well that \nit would often gracefully lift a hind leg and \nrun very easily and quickly on three legs, as if \ndisdaining to use all four. Everything pleased \nit. Now it would roll on its back, yelping with \ndelight, now bask in the sun with a thoughtful \nair of importance, and now frolic about play- \ning with a chip of wood or a straw. \n\nPierre's attire by now consisted of a dirty \ntorn shirt (the only remnant of his former \nclothing), a pair of soldier's trousers which by \n\n\n\nKaratdev's advice he tied with string round the \nankles for warmth, and a peasant coat and cap. \nPhysically he had changed much during this \ntime. He no longer seemed stout, though he \nstill had the appearanccof solidityandstrength \nhereditary in his family. A beard and mustache \ncovered the lower part of his face, and a tangle \nof hair, infested with lice, curled round his head \nlike a cap. The look of his eyes was resolute, \ncalm, and animatedly alert, as never before. \nThe former slackness which had shown itself \neven in his eyes was now replaced by an ener- \ngetic readiness for action and resistance. His \nfeet were bare. \n\nPierre first looked down the field across \nwhich vehicles and horsemen were passing that \nmorning, then into the distance across the riv- \ner, then at the dog who was pretending to be \nin earnest about biting him, and then at his \nbare feet which he placed with pleasure in vari- \nous positions, moving his dirty thick big toes. \nEvery time he looked at his bare feet a smile \nof animated self-satisfaction flitted across his \nface. The sight of them reminded him of all he \nhad experienced and learned during these \nweeks and this recollection was pleasant to \nhim. \n\nFor some days the weather had been calm \nand clear with slight frosts in the mornings \nwhat is called an "old wives' summer." \n\nIn the sunshine the air was warm, and that \nwarmth was particularly pleasant with the in- \nvigorating freshness of the morning frost still \nin the air. \n\nOn everything far and near lay the magic \ncrystal glitter seen only at that tinieof autumn. \nThe Sparrow Hills were visible in the distance, \nwith the village, the church, and the large white \nhouse. The bare trees, the sand, the bricks and \nroofs of the houses, the green church spire, and \nthe corners of the white house in the distance, \nall stood out in the transparent air in most \ndelicate outline and with unnatural clearness. \nNear by could be seen the familiar ruins of a \nhalf-burned mansion occupied by the French, \nwith lilac bushes still showing dark green be- \nside the fence. And even that ruined and be- \nfouled house which in dull weather was re- \npulsively ugly- seemed quietly beautiful now, \nin the clear, motionless brilliance. \n\nA French corporal, with coat unbuttoned in \na homely way, a skullcap on his head, and a \nshort pipe in his mouth, came from behind a \ncorner of the shed and approached Pierre with \na friendly wink. \n\n"What sunshine, Monsieur Kiril!" (Their \n\n\n\n576 \n\nname for Pierre.) "Eh? Just like springl" \n\nAnd the corporal leaned against the door \nand offered Pierre his pipe, though whenever \nhe offered it Pierre always declined it. \n\n"To be on the march in such weather . . ." \nhe began. \n\nPierre inquired what was being said about \nleaving, and the corporal told him that nearly \nall the troops were starting and there ought to \nbe an order about the prisoners that day. Soko- \nlov, one of the soldiers in the shed with Pierre, \nwas dying, and Pierre told the corporal that \nsomething should be done about him. The \ncorporal replied that Pierre need not worry \nabout that as they had an ambulance and a \npermanent hospital and arrangements would \nbe made for the sick, and that in general every- \nthing that could happen had been foreseen by \nthe authorities. \n\n"Besides, Monsieur Kiril, you have only to \nsay a word to the captain, you know. He is a \nman who never forgets anything. Speak to the \ncaptain when he makes his round, he will do \nanything for you." \n\n(The captain of whom the corporal spoke \noften had long chats with Pierre and showed \nhim all sorts of favors.) \n\n" 'You see, St. Thomas,' he said to me the \nother day. 'Monsieur Kiril is a man of educa- \ntion, who speaks French. He is a Russian sei- \ngneur who has had misfortunes, but he is a man. \nHe knows what's what. ... If he wants any- \nthing and asks me, he won't get a refusal. When \none has studied, you see, one likes education \nand well-bred people.' It is for your sake I \nmention it, Monsieur Kiril. The other day if \nit had not been for you that affair would have \nended ill." \n\nAnd after chatting a while longer, the cor- \nporal went away. (The affair he had alluded \nto had happened a few days beforea fight be- \ntween the prisoners and the French soldiers, \nin which Pierre had succeeded in pacifying his \ncomrades.) Some of the prisoners who had \nheard Pierre talking to the corporal immedi- \nately asked what the Frenchman had said. While \nPierre was repeating what he had been told \nabout the army leaving Moscow, a thin, sallow, \ntattered French soldier came up to the door of \nthe shed. Rapidly and timidly raising his fin- \ngers to his forehead by way of greeting, he \nasked Pierre whether the soldier Platoche to \nwhom he had given a shirt to sew was in that \nshed. \n\nA week before the French had had boot \nleather and linen issued to them, which they \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nhad given out to the prisoners to make up into \nboots and shirts for them. \n\n"Ready, ready, dear fellow!" said Karatdev, \ncoming out with a neatly folded shirt. \n\nKaratdev, on account of the warm weather \nand for convenience at work, was wearing only \ntrousers and a tattered shirt as black as soot. \nHis hair was bound round, workman fashion, \nwith a wisp of lime-tree bast, and his round \nface seemed rounder and pleasanter than ever. \n\n"A promise is own brother to performance! \nI said Friday and here it is, ready," said Plat6n, \nsmiling and unfolding the shirt he had sewn. \n\nThe Frenchman glanced around uneasily \nand then, as if overcoming his hesitation, rapid- \nly threw off his uniform and put on the shirt. \nHe had a long, greasy, flowered silk waistcoat \nnext to his sallow, thin bare body, but no shirt. \nHe was evidently afraid the prisoners looking \non would laugh at him, and thrust his head \ninto the shirt hurriedly. None of the prisoners \nsaid a word. \n\n"See, it fits well!" Plat6n kept repeating, \npulling the shirt straight. \n\nThe Frenchman, having pushed his head \nand hands through, without raising his eyes, \nlooked down at the shirt and examined the \nseams. \n\n"You see, dear man, this is not a sewing \nshop, and I had no proper tools; and, as they \nsay, one needs a tool even to kill a louse," said \nPlat6n with one of his round smiles, obviously \npleased with his work. \n\n"It's good, quite good, thank you," said the \nFrenchman, in French, "but there must be \nsome linen left over." \n\n"It will, fit better still when it sets to your \nbody," said Karatdev, still admiring his handi- \nwork. "You'll be nice and comfortable. . . ." \n\n"Thank*s, thanks, old fellow But the bits \n\nleft over?" said the Frenchman again and \nsmiled. He took out an assignation ruble note \nand gave it to Karatdev. "But give me the \npieces that are over." \n\nPierre saw that Plat6n did not want to un- \nderstand what the Frenchman was saying, and \nhe looked on without interfering. Karatdev \nthanked the Frenchman for the money and \nwent on admiring his own work. The French- \nman insisted on having the pieces returned \nthat were left over and asked Pierre to trans- \nlate what he said. \n\n"What does he want the bits for?" said Kara- \ntdev. "They'd make fine leg bands for us. Well, \nnever mind." \n\nAnd Karatdev, with a suddenly changed and \n\n\n\nBOOK THIRTEEN \n\nsaddened expression, took a small bundle of \nscraps from inside his shirt and gave it to the \nFrenchman without looking at him. "Oh dear 1" \nmuttered Karataev and went away. The French- \nman looked at the linen, considered for a mo- \nment, then looked inquiringly at Pierre and, \nas if Pierre's look had told him something, sud- \ndenly blushed and shouted in a squeaky voice: \n\n"Platoche! Eh, Platochel Keep them your- \nself 1" And handing back the odd bits he turned \nand went out. \n\n"There, look at that," said Kara tdev, swaying \nhis head. "People said they were not Christians, \nbut they too have souls. It's what the old folk \nused to say: 'A sweating hand's an open hand, \na dry hand's close/ He's naked, but yet he's \ngiven it back." \n\nKarataev smiled thoughtfully and was silent \nawhile looking at the pieces. \n\n"But they'll make grand leg bands, dear \nfriend," he said, and went back into the shed. \n\n\n\n577 \n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII \n\nFOUR WEEKS had passed since Pierre had been \ntaken prisoner and though the French had of- \nfered to move him from the men's to the of- \nficers' shed, he had stayed in the shed where he \nwas first put. \n\nIn burned and devastated Moscow Pierre \nexperienced almost the extreme limits of pri- \nvation a man can endure; but thanks to his \nphysical strength and health, of which he had \ntill then been unconscious, and thanks especial- \nly to the fact that the privations came so \ngradually that it was impossible to say when \nthey began, he endured his position not only \nlightly but joyfully. And just at this time he \nobtained the tranquillity and ease of mind he \nhad formerly striven in vain to reach. He had \nlong sought in different ways that tranquillity \nof mind, that inner harmony which had so im- \npressed him in the soldiers at the battle of Bo- \nrodino. He had sought it in philanthropy, in \nFreemasonry, in the dissipations of town life, \nin wine, in heroic feats of self-sacrifice, and in \nromantic love for Natdsha; he had sought it by \nreasoning and all these quests and experi- \nments had failed him. And now without think- \ning about it he had found that peace and in- \nner harmony only through the horror of death, \nthrough privation, and through what he rec- \nognized in Karatdev. \n\nThose dreadful moments he had lived \nthrough at the executions had as it were for- \never washed away from his imagination and \nmemory the agitating thoughts and feelings \n\n\n\nthat had formerly seemed so important. It did \nnot now occur to him to think of Russia, or the \nwar, or politics, or Napoleon. It was plain to \nhim that all these things were no business of \nhis, and that he was not called on to judge con- \ncerning them and therefore could not do so. \n"Russia and summer weather are not bound \ntogether," he thought, repeating words of Ka- \nratacv's which he found strangely consoling. \nHis intention of killing Napoleon and his cal- \nculations of the cabalistic number of the beast \nof the Apocalypse now seemed to him mean- \ningless and even ridiculous. His anger with his \nwife and anxiety that his name should not be \nsmirched now seemed not merely trivial but \neven amusing. What concern was it of his that \nsomewhere or other that woman was leading \nthe life she preferred? What did it matter to \nanybody, and especially to him, whether or not \nthey found out that their prisoner's name was \nCount Bezukhov? \n\nHe now often remembered his conversation \nwith Prince Andrew and quite agreed with \nhim, though he understood Prince Andrew's \nthoughts somewhat differently. Prince Andrew \nhad thought and said that happiness could on- \nly be negative, but had said it with a shade of \nbitterness and irony as though he was really \nsaying that all desire for positive happiness is \nimplanted in us merely to torment us and nev- \ner be satisfied. But Pierre believed it without \nany mental reservation. The absence of suffer- \ning, the satisfaction of one's needs and conse- \nquent freedom in the choice of one's occupa- \ntion, that is, of one's way of life, now seemed \nto Pierre to be indubitably man's highest hap- \npiness. Here and now for the first time he fully \nappreciated the enjoyment of eating when he \nwanted to eat, drinking when he wanted to \ndrink, sleeping when he wanted to sleep, of \nwarmth when he was cold, of talking to a fel- \nlow man when he wished to talk and to hear a \nhuman voice. The satisfaction of one's needs- \ngood food, cleanliness, and freedomnow that \nhe was deprived of all this, seemed to Pierre to \nconstitute perfect happiness; and the choice of \noccupation, that is, of his way of life now that \nthat choice was so restricted seemed to him \nsuch an easy matter that he forgot that a super- \nfluity of the comforts of life destroys all joy in \nsatisfying one's needs, while great freedom in \nthe choice of occupation such freedom as \nhis wealth, his education, and his social posi- \ntion had given him in his own life is just \nwhat makes the choice of occupation in- \nsolubly difficult and destroys the desire and \n\n\n\n578 \n\npossibility of having an occupation. \n\nAll Pierre's daydreams now turned on the \ntime when he would be free. Yet subsequently, \nand for the rest of his life, he thought and \nspoke with enthusiasm of that month of cap- \ntivity, of those irrecoverable, strong, joyful \nsensations, and chiefly of the complete peace \nof mind and inner freedom which he experi- \nenced only during those weeks. \n\nWhen on the first day he got up early, went \nout of the shed at dawn, and saw the cupolas \nand crosses of the New Convent of the Virgin \nstill dark at first, the hoarfrost on the dusty \ngrass, the Sparrow Hills, and the wooded banks \nabove the winding river vanishing in the pur- \nple distance, when he felt the contact of the \nfresh air and heard the noise of the crows fly- \ning from Moscow across the field, and when \nafterwards light gleamed from the east and the \nsun's rim appeared solemnly from behind a \ncloud, and the cupolas and crosses, the hoar- \nfrost, the distance and the river, all began to \nsparkle in the glad light Pierre felt a new joy \nand strength in life such as he had never be- \nfore known. And this not only stayed with him \nduring the whole of his imprisonment, but \neven grew in strength as the hardships of his \nposition increased. \n\nThat feeling of alertness and of readiness for \nanything was still further strengthened in him \nby the high opinion his fellow prisoners formed \nof him soon after his arrival at the shed. With \nhis knowledge of languages, the respect shown \nhim by the French, his simplicity, his readiness \nto give anything asked of him (he received the \nallowance of three rubles a week made to of- \nficers); with his strength, which he showed to \nthe soldiers by pressing nails into the walls of \nthe hut; his gentleness to his companions, and \nhis capacity for sitting still and thinking with- \nout doing anything (which seemed to them in- \ncomprehensible), he appeared to them a rather \nmysterious and superior being. The very quali- \nties that had been a hindrance, if not actually \nharmful, to him in the world he had lived in \nhis strength, his disdain for the comforts of \nlife, his absent-mindedness and simplicity \nhere among these people gave him almost the \nstatus of a hero. And Pierre felt that their opin- \nion placed responsibilities upon him. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII \nTHE FRENCH EVACUATION began on the night \nbetween the sixth and seventh of October: \nkitchens and sheds were dismantled, carts \nloaded, and troops and baggage trains started. \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\nAt seven in the morning a French convoy in \nmarching trim, wearing shakos and carrying \nmuskets, knapsacks, and enormous sacks, stood \nin front of the sheds, and animated French talk \nmingled with curses sounded all along the \nlines. \n\nIn the shed everyone was ready, dressed, \nbelted, shod, and only awaited the order to \nstart. The sick soldier, Sokol6v, pale and thin \nwith dark shadows round his eyes, alone sat in \nhis place barefoot and not dressed. His eyes, \nprominent from the emaciation of his face, \ngazed inquiringly at his comrades who were \npaying no attention to him, and he moaned \nregularly and quietly. It was evidently not so \nmuch his sufferings that caused him to moan \n(he had dysentery) as his fear and grief at be- \ning left alone. \n\nPierre, girt with a rope round his waist and \nwearing shoes Karatdev had made for him \nfrom some leather a French soldier had torn \noff a tea chest and brought to have his boots \nmended with, went up to the sick man and \nsquatted down beside him. \n\n"You know, Sokol6v, they are not all going \naway! They have a hospital here. You may be \nbetter off than we others/' said Pierre. \n\n"O LordI Oh, it will be the death of me! O \nLord!" moaned the man in a louder voice. \n\n"I'll go and ask them again directly," said \nPierre, rising and going to the door of the shed. \n\nJust as Pierre reached the door, the corporal \nwho had offered him a pipe the day before \ncame up to it with two soldiers. The corporal \nand soldiers were in marching kit with knap- \nsacks and shakos that had metal straps, and \nthese changed their familiar faces. \n\nThe corporal came, according to orders, to \nshut the door. The prisoners had to be counted \nbefore being let out. \n\n"Corporal, what will they do with the sick \nman? . . ." Pierre began. \n\nBut even as he spoke he began to doubt \nwhether this was the corporal he knew or a \nstranger, so unlike himself did the corporal \nseem at that moment. Moreover, just as Pierre \nwas speaking a sharp rattle of drums was sud- \ndenly heard from both sides. The corporal \nfrowned at Pierre's wdrds and, uttering some \nmeaningless oaths, slammed the door. The shed \nbecame semidark, and the sharp rattle of the \ndrums on two sides drowned the sick man's \n\n\n\ngroans. \n\n"There it ist . . . It again! . . ." said Pierre to \nhimself, and an involuntary shudder ran down \nhis spine. In the corporal's changed face, in \n\n\n\nBOOK THIRTEEN \n\nthe sound of his voice, in the stirring and deaf- \nening noise of the drums, he recognized that \nmysterious, callous force which compelled peo- \nple against their will to kill their fellow men \nthat force the effect of which he had witnessed \nduring the executions. To fear or to try to es- \ncape that force, to address entreaties or exhor- \ntations to those who served as its tools, was use- \nless. Pierre knew this now. One had to wait \nand endure. He did not again go to the sick \nman, nor turn to look at him, but stood frown- \ning by the door of the hut. \n\nWhen that door was opened and the pris- \noners, crowding against one another like a flock \nof sheep, squeezed into the exit, Pierre pushed \nhis way forward and approached that very cap- \ntain who as the corporal had assured him was \nready to do anything for him. The captain was \nalso in marching kit, and on his cold face ap- \npeared that same it which Pierre had recog- \nnized in the corporal's words and in the roll of \nthe drums. \n\n"Pass on, pass on I" the captain reiterated, \nfrowning sternly, and looking at the prisoners \nwho thronged past him. \n\nPierre went up to him, though he knew his \nattempt would be vain. \n\n"What now?" the officer asked with a cold \nlook as if not recognizing Pierre. \n\nPierre told him about the sick man. \n\n"He'll manage to walk, devil take him!" said \nthe captain. "Pass on, pass onl" he continued \nwithout looking at Pierre. \n\n"But he is dying," Pierre again began. \n\n"Be so good . . ." shouted the captain, frown- \ning angrily. \n\n"Dram- da- da- dam, dam-dam . . ." rattled the \ndrums, and Pierre understood that this mysteri- \nous force completely controlled these men and \nthat it was now useless to say any more. \n\nThe officer prisoners were separated from the \nsoldiers and told to march in front. There were \nabout thirty officers, with Pierre among them, \nand about three hundred men. \n\nThe officers, who had come from the other \nsheds, were all strangers to Pierre and much \nbetter dressed than he. They looked at him \nand at his shoes mistrustfully, as at an alien. \nNot far from him walked a fat major with a sal- \nlow, bloated, angry face, who was wear ing a Ka- \nzan dressing grown tied round with a towel, \nand who evidently enjoyed the respect of his \nfellow prisoners. He kept one hand, in which \nhe clasped his tobacco pouch, inside the bosom \nof his dressing gown and held the stem of his \npipe firmly with the other. Panting and puffing, \n\n\n\n579 \n\nthe major grumbled and growled at everybody \nbecause hp thought he was being pushed and \nthat they were all hurrying when they had no- \nwhere to hurry to and were -all surprised at \nsomething when, there was nothing to be sur- \nprised at. Another, a thin little officer, was \nspeaking to everyone, conjecturing where they \nwere now being taken and how far they would \nget that day. An official in felt boots and wear- \ning a commissariat uniform ran round from \nside to side and gazed at the ruins of Moscow, \nloudly announcing his observations as to what \nhad been burned down and what this or that \npart of the city was that they could see. A third \nofficer, who by his accent was a Pole, disputed \nwith the commissariat officer, arguing that he \nwas mistaken in his identification of the differ- \nent wards of Moscow. \n\n"What are you disputing about?" said the \nmajor angrily. "What does it matter whether it \nis St. Nicholas or St. Blasius? You see it's burned \ndown, and there's an end of it. ... What are \nyou pushing for? Isn't the road wide enough?" \nsaid he, turning to a man behind him who was \nnot pushing him at all. \n\n"Oh, oh, oh! What have they done?" the \nprisoners on one side and another were heard \nsaying as they gazed on the charred ruins. "All \nbeyond the river, and Zubova, and in the Krm- \nlin. . . . Just look! There's not half of it left. Yes, \nI told you the whole quarter beyond the riv- \ner, and so it is." \n\n"Well, you know it's burned, so what's the \nuse of talking?" said the major. \n\nAs they passed near a church in the Kham6v- \nniki (one of the few unburned quarters of \nMoscow) the whole mass of prisoners suddenly \nstarted to one side and exclamations of horror \nand disgust were heard. \n\n"Ah, the villains! What heathens! Yes; dead, \ndead, so he is. ... And smeared with some- \nthing!" \n\nPierre too drew near the church where the \nthing was that evoked these exclamations, and \ndimly made out something leaning against the \npalings surrounding the church. From the \nwords of his comrades who saw better than he \ndid, he found that this was the body of a man, \nset upright against the palings with its face \nsmeared with soot. \n\n"Go on! What the devil ... Go on! Thirty \nthousand devils! ..." the convoy guards began \ncursing and the French soldiers, with fresh \nvirulence, drove away with their swords the \ncrowd of prisoners who were gazing at the dead \nman. \n\n\n\n5 8o \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV \n\nTHROUGH THE CROSS STREETS of the Khamovni- \nki quarter the prisoners marched, followed \nonly by their escort and the vehicles and wag- \nons belonging to that escort, but when they \nreached the supply stores they came among a \nhuge and closely packed train of artillery min- \ngled with private vehicles. \n\nAt the bridge they all halted, waiting for \nthose in front to get across. From the bridge \nthey had a view of endless lines of moving bag- \ngage trains before and behind them. To the \nright, where the Kaluga road turns near Nes- \nkuchny, endless rows of troops and carts \nstretched away into the distance. These were \ntroops of Beauharnais' corps which had start- \ned before any of the others. Behind, along the \nriverside and across the Stone Bridge, were \nNey's troops and transport. \n\nDavout's troops, in whose charge were the \nprisoners, were crossing the Crimean bridge \nand some were already debouching into the \nKaluga road. But the baggage trains stretched \nout so that the last of Beauharnais' train had \nnot yet got out of Moscow and reached the Ka- \nluga road when the vanguard of Ney's army \nwas already emerging from the Great Ordy nka \nStreet. \n\nWhen they had crossed the Crimean bridge \nthe prisoners moved a few steps forward, halt- \ned, and again moved on, and from all sides ve- \nhicles and men crowded closer and closer to- \ngether. They advanced the few hundred paces \nthat separated the bridge from the Kaluga \nroad, taking more than an hour to do so, and \ncame out upon the square where the streets of \nthe Transmoskvd. ward and the Kaluga road \nconverge, and the prisoners jammed close to- \ngether had to stand for some hours at that cross- \nway. From all sides, like the roar of the sea, \nwere heard the rattle of wheels, the tramp of \nfeet, and incessant shouts of anger and abuse. \nPierre stood pressed against the wall of a \ncharred house, listening to that noise which \nmingled in his imagination with the roll of \nthe drums. \n\nTo get a better view, several officer prisoners \nclimbed onto the wall of the half-burned house \nagainst which Pierre was leaning. \n\n"What crowds! Just look at the crowds! . . . \nThey've loaded goods even on the cannon! \nLook there, those are furs!" they exclaimed. \n"Just see what the blackguards have looted. . . . \nThere! See what that one has behind in the \ncart. . . . Why, those are settings taken from \nsome icons, by heaven! . . . Oh, the rascals! . . . \n\n\n\nSee how that fellow has loaded himself up, he \ncan hardly walk! Good lord, they've even \ngrabbed those chaises! ... See that fellow there \nsitting on the trunks. . . . Heavens! They're \nfighting." \n\n"That's right, hit him on the snout on his \nsnout! Like this, we shan't get away before \nevening. Look, look there. . . . Why, that must \nbe Napoleon's own. See what horses! And the \nmonograms with a crown! It's like a portable \nhouse. . . . That fellow's dropped his sack and \ndoesn't see it. Fighting again ... A woman \nwith a baby, and not bad-looking either! Yes, \nI dare say, that's the way they'll let you pass. \n. . . Just look, there's no end to it. Russian \nwenches, by heaven, so they are! In carriages \nsee how comfortably they've settled them- \nselves!" \n\nAgain, as at the church in Kham6vniki, a \nwave of general curiosity bore all the prisoners \nforward onto the road, and Pierre, thanks to \nhis stature, saw over the heads of the others \nwhat so attracted their curiosity. In three car- \nriages involved among the munition carts, close- \nly squeezed together, sat women with rouged \nfaces, dressed in glaring colors, who were shout- \ning something in shrill voices. \n\nFrom the moment Pierre had recognized the \nappcaranceof themysterious force nothing had \nseemed to him strange or dreadful: neither the \ncorpse smeared with soot for fun nor these \nwomen hurrying away nor the burned ruihs of \nMoscow. All that he now witnessed scarcely \nmade an impression on him as if his soul, \nmaking ready for a hard struggle, refused to re- \nceive impressions that might weaken it. \n\nThe women's vehicles drove by. Behind them \ncame more carts, soldiers, wagons, soldiers, gun \ncarriages, carriages, soldiers, ammunition carts, \nmore soldiers, and now and then women, \n\nPierre did not see the people as individuals \nbut saw their movement. \n\nAll these people and horses seemed driven \nforward by some invisible power. During the \nhour Pierre watched them they all came flow- \ning from the different streets with one and the \nsame desire to get on quickly; they all jostled \none another, began to grow angry and to fight, \nwhite teeth gleamed, brows frowned, ever the \nsame words of abuse flew from side to side, and \nall the faces bore the same swaggeringly reso- \nlute and coldly cruel expression that had struck \nPierre thatmorningon the corporal's face when \nthe drums were beating. \n\nIt was not till nearly evening that the officer \ncommanding the escort collected his men and \n\n\n\nBOOK THIRTEEN \n\n\n\n581 \n\n\n\nwith shouts and quarrels forced his way in \namong the baggage trains, and the prisoners, \nhemmed in on all sides, emerged onto the Ka- \nluga road. \n\nThey marched very quickly, without resting, \nand halted only when the sun began to set. \nThe baggage carts drew up close together and \nthe men began to prepare for their night's rest. \nThey all appeared angry and dissatisfied. For \na long time, oaths, angry shouts, and fighting \ncould be heard from all sides. A carriage that \nfollowed the escort ran into one of the carts \nand knocked a hole in it with its pole. Several \nsoldiers ran toward the cart from different \nsides: some beat the carriage horses on their \nheads, turning them aside, others fought \namong themselves, and Pierre saw that one \nGerman was badly wounded on the head by a \nsword. \n\nIt seemed that all these men, now that they \nhad stopped amid fields in the chill dusk of \nthe autumn evening, experienced one and the \nsame feeling of unpleasant awakening from \nthe hurry and eagerness to push on that had \nseized them at the start. Once at a standstill \nthey all seemed to understand that they did not \nyet know where they were going, and that much \nthat was painful and difficult awaited them on \nthis journey. \n\nDuring this halt the escort treated the pris- \noners even worse than they had done at the \nstart. It was here that the prisoners for the first \ntime received horseflesh for their meat ration. \n\nFrom the officer down to the lowest soldier \nthey all showed what seemed like personal spite \nagainst each of the prisoners, in unexpected \ncontrast to their former friendly relations. \n\nThis spite increased still more when, on call- \ning over the roll of prisoners, it was found that \nin the bustle of leaving Moscow one Russian \nsoldier, who had pretended to suffer from colic, \nhad escaped. Pierre saw a Frenchman beat a \nRussian soldier cruelly for straying too far \nfrom the road, and heard his friend the cap- \ntain reprimand and threaten to court-martial \na noncommissioned officer on account of the \nescape of the Russian. To the noncommissioned \nofficer's excuse that the prisoner was ill and \ncould not walk, the officer replied that the or- \nder was to shoot those who lagged behind. \nPierre felt that that fatal force which had \ncrushed him during the executions, but which \nhe had not felt during his imprisonment, now \nagain controlled his existence. It was terrible, \nbut he felt that in proportion to the efforts of \nthat fatal force to crush him, there grew and \n\n\n\nstrengthened in his soul a power of life inde- \npendent of it. \n\nHe ate his supper of buckwheat soup with \nhorseflesh and chatted with his comrades. \n\nNeither Pierre nor any of the others spoke \nof what they had seen in Moscow, or of the \nroughness of their treatment by the French, or \nof the order to shoot them which had been an- \nnounced to them. As if in reaction against the \nworsening of their position they were all par- \nticularly animated and gay. They spoke of per- \nsonal reminiscences, of amusing scenes they \nhad witnessed during the campaign, and avoid- \ned all talk of their present situation. \n\nThe sun had set long since. Bright stars shone \nout here and there in the sky. A red glow as of \na conflagration spread above the horizon from \nthe rising full moon, and that vast red ball \nswayed strangely in the gray haze. It grew light. \nThe evening was ending, but the night had not \nyet come. Pierre got up and left his new com- \npanions, crossing between the campfires to the \nother side of the road where he had been told \nthe common soldier prisoners were stationed. \nHe wanted to talk to them. On the road he was \nstopped by a French sentinel who ordered him \nback. \n\nPierre turned back, not to his companions by \nthe campfire, but to an unharnessed cart \nwhere there was nobody. Tucking his legs un- \nder him and dropping his head he sat down on \nthe cold ground by the wheel of the cart and \nremained motionless a long while sunk in \nthought. Suddenly he burst out into a fit of his \nbroad, good-natured laughter, so loud that \nmen from various sides turned with surprise \nto see what this strange and evidently solitary \nlaughter could mean. \n\n"Ha-ha-ha!" laughed Pierre. And he said \naloud to himself: "The soldier did not let me \npass. They took me and shut me up. They hold \nme captive. What, me? Me? My immortal soul? \nHa-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha! . . ." and he laughed till \ntears started to his eyes. \n\nA man got up and came to see what this \nqueer big fellow was laughing at all by him- \nself. Pierre stopped laughing, got up, went \nfarther away from the inquisitive man, and \nlooked around him. \n\nThe huge, endless bivouac that had previ- \nously resounded with the cracklingof campfires \nand the voices of many men had grown quiet, \nthe red campfires were growing paler and dy- \ning down. High up in the light sky hung the \nfull moon. Forests and fields beyond the camp, \nunseen before, were now visible in the dis- \n\n\n\n582 \n\ntance. And farther still, beyond those forests \nand fields, the bright, oscillating, limitless dis- \ntance lured one to itself. Pierre glanced up at \nthe sky and the twinkling stars in its faraway \ndepths. "And all that is me, all that is within \nme, and it is all II" thought Pierre. "And they \ncaught all that and put it into a shed boarded \nup with planks!" He smiled, and went and \nlay down to sleep beside his companions. \n\nCHAPTER XV \n\nIN THE EARLY DAYS of October another envoy \ncame to Kutuzov with a letter from Napoleon \nproposing peace and falsely dated from Mos- \ncow, though Napoleon was already not far \nfrom Kutuzov on the old Kaluga road. Kutu- \nzov replied to this letter as he had done to the \none formerly brought by Lauriston, saying that \nthere could be no question of peace. \n\nSoon after that a report was received from \nD6rokhov's guerrilla detachment operating to \nthe left of Tariitino that troops of Broussier's \ndivision had been seen at Forminsk and that \nbeing separated from the rest of the French \narmy they might easily be destroyed. The \nsoldiers and officers again demanded action. \nGenerals on the staff, excited by the memory \nof the easy victory at Tanitino, urged Kutuzov \nto carry out Dorokhov's suggestion. Kutuzov \ndid not consider any offensive necessary. The \nresult was a compromise which was inevitable: \na small detachment was sent to Formfnsk to \nattack Broussier. \n\nBy a strange coincidence, this task, which \nturned out to be a most difficult and important \none, was entrusted to Dokhtiirov that same \nmodest little Dokhtiirov whom no one had de- \nscribed to us as drawing up plans of 'battles, \ndashing about in front of regiments, shower- \ning crosses on batteries, and so on, and who \nwas thought to be and was spoken of as un- \ndecided and undiscerning but whom we find \ncommanding wherever the position was most \ndifficult all through the Russo-French wars \nfrom Austerlitz to the year 1813. At Austerlitz \nhe remained last at the Augezd dam, rallying \nthe regiments, saving what was possible when \nall were flying and perishing and not a single \ngeneral was left in the rearguard. Ill with fever \nhe went to Smolensk with twenty thousand \nmen to defend the town against Napoleon's \nwhole army. In Smolensk, at the Maldkhov \nGate, he had hardly dozed off in a paroxysm of \nfever before he was awakened by the bombard- \nment of the town and Smolensk held out all \nday long. At the battle of Borodin6, when \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\nBagrati6n was killed and nine tenths of the \nmen of our left flank had fallen and the full \nforce of the French artillery fire was directed \nagainst it, the man sent there was this same \nirresolute and undiscerning Dokhtiirov Kut- \nuzov hastening to rectify a mistake he had \nmade by sending someone else there first. And \nthe quiet little Dokhtiirov rode thither, and \nBorodin6 became the greatest glory of the \nRussian army. Many heroes have been de- \nscribed to us in verse and prose, but of Dokh- \ntiirov scarcely a word has been said. \n\nIt was Dokhtiirov again whom they sent to \nFormfnsk and from there to Mdlo-Yarosldvets, \nthe place where the last battle with the French \nwas fought and where the obvious disintegra- \ntion of the French army began; and we are \ntold of many geniuses and heroes of that \nperiod of the campaign, but of Dokhtiirov \nnothing or very little is said and that dubi- \nously. And this silence about Dokhtiirov is the \nclearest testimony to his merit. \n\nIt is natural for a man who docs not under- \nstand the workings of a machine to imagine \nthat a shaving that has fallen into it by chance \nand is interfering with its action and tossing \nabout in it is its most important part. The man \nwho does not understand the construction of \nthe machine cannot conceive that the small \nconnecting cogwheel which revolves quietly is \none of the most essential parts of the machine, \nand not the shaving which merely harms and \nhinders the working. \n\nOn the tenth of October when Dokhtiirov \nhad gone halfway to Forminsk and stopped at \nthe village of Arist6vo, preparing faithfully to \nexecute the orders he had received, the whole \nFrench army having, in its convulsive move- \nment, reached Murat's position apparently in \norder to give battle suddenly without any \nreason turned off to the left onto the new \nKaluga road and began to enter Formfnsk, \nwhere only Broussier had been till then. At \nthat time Dokhtiirov had under his command, \nbesides D6rokhov's detachment, the two small \nguerrilla detachments of Figner and Sesldvin. \n\nOn the evening of October 1 1 Seslvin came \nto the Arist6vo headquarters with a French \nguardsman he had captured. The prisoner \nsaid that the troops that had entered Formfnsk \nthat day were the vanguard of the whole army, \nthat Napoleon was there and the whole army \nhad left Moscow four days previously. That \nsame evening a house serf who had come from \nBorovsk said he had seen an immense army \nentering the town. Some Cossacks of Dokhtii- \n\n\n\nBOOK THIRTEEN \n\nrov's detachment reported having sighted the \nFrench Guards marching along the road to \nB6rovsk. From all these reports it was evident \nthat where they had expected to meet a single \ndivision there was now the whole French army \nmarching from Moscow in an unexpected di- \nrectionalong the Kaluga road. Dokhturov \nwas unwilling to undertake any action, as it \nwas not clear to him now what he ought to do. \nHe had been ordered to attack Formfnsk. But \nonly Broussier had been there at that time and \nnow the whole French army was there. Erm6- \nlov wished to act on his own judgment, but \nDokhturov insisted that he must have Kutii- \nzov's instructions. So it was decided to send a \ndispatch to the staff. \n\nFor this purpose a capable officer, Bolkhovf- \ntinov, was chosen, who was to explain the \nwhole affair by word of mouth, besides deliver- \ning a written report. Toward midnight Bolk- \nhovitinov, having received the dispatch and \nverbal instructions, galloped off to the General \nStaff accompanied by a Cossack with spare \nhorses. \n\n\n\n583 \n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI \n\nIT WAS a warm, dark, autumn night. It had \nbeen raining for four days. Having changed \nhorses twice and galloped twenty miles in an \nhour and a half over a sticky, muddy road, \nBolkhovitinov reached Litashevka after one \no'clock at night. Dismounting at a cottage on \nwhose wattle fence hung a signboard, GENERAL \nSTAFF, and throwing down his reins, he en- \ntered a dark passage. \n\n"The general on duty, quickl It's very im- \nportant!" said he to someone who had risen \nand was sniffing in the dark passage. \n\n"He has been very unwell since the evening \nand this is the third night he has not slept," \nsaid the orderly pleadingly in a whisper. "You \nshould wake the captain first." \n\n"But this is very important, from General \nDokhturov," said Bolkhovitinov, entering the \nopen door which he had found by feeling in \nthe dark. \n\nThe orderly had gone in before him and \nbegan waking somebody. \n\n"Your honor, your honor! A courier." \n\n"What? What's that? From whom?" came a \nsleepy voice. \n\n"From Dokhturov and from Alexdy Petr6- \nvich. Napoleon is at Forminsk," said Bolkhovl- \ntinov, unable to see in the dark who was speak- \ning but guessing by the voice that it was not \nKonovnitsyn. \n\n\n\nThe man who had wakened yawned and \nstretched himself. \n\n"I don't like waking him/ 1 he said, fumbling \nfor something. "He is very ill. Perhaps this is \nonly a rumor." \n\n"Here is the dispatch," said Bolkhovitinov. \n"My orders are to give it at once to the gen- \neral on duty." \n\n"Wait a moment, I'll light a candle. You \ndamned rascal, where do you always hide it?" \nsaid the voice of the man who was stretching \nhimself, to the orderly. (This was Shcherbinin, \nKonovnitsyn's adjutant.) "I've found it, I've \nfound itl" he added. \n\nThe orderly was striking a light and Shcher- \nbfnin was fumbling for something on the \ncandlestick. \n\n"Oh, the nasty beasts!" said he with disgust. \n\nBy the light of the sparks Bolkhovftinov saw \nShcherbinin's youthful face as he held the \ncandle, and the face of another man who was \nstill asleep. This was Konovnitsyn. \n\nWhen the flame of the sulphur splinters \nkindled by the tinder burned up, first blue and \nthen red, Shcherbinin lit the tallow candle, \nfrom the candlestick of which the cockroaches \nthat had been gnawing it were running away, \nand looked at the messenger. Bolkhovitinov \nwas bespattered all over with mud and had \nsmeared his face by wiping it with his sleeve. \n\n"Who gave the report?" inquired Shchfer- \nbinin, taking the envelope. \n\n"The news is reliable," said Bolkhovitinov. \n"Prisoners, Cossacks, and the scouts all say the \nsame thing." \n\n"There's nothing to be done, we'll have to \nwake him," said Shcherbinin, rising and going \nup to the man in the nightcap who lay cov- \nered by a greatcoat. "Peter PetrovichI" said he. \n(Konovnftsyn did not stir.) "To the General \nStaff!" he said with a smile, knowing that those \nwords would be sure to arouse him. \n\nAnd in fact the head in the nightcap was \nlifted at once. On Konovnitsyn's handsome, \nresolute face with checks flushed by fever, \nthere still remained for an instant a faraway \ndreamy expression remote from present af- \nfairs, but then he suddenly started and his \nface assumed its habitual calm and firm ap- \npearance. \n\n"Well, what is it? From whom?" he asked \nimmediately but without hurry, blinking at \nthe light. \n\nWhile listening to theofficer's report Konov- \nnftsyn broke the seal and read the dispatch. \nHardly had he done so before he lowered his \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nlegs in their woolen stockings to the earthen \nfloor and began putting on his boots. Then he \ntook off his nightcap, combed his hair over \nhis temples, and donned his cap. \n\n"Did you get here quickly? Let us go to his \nHighness." \n\nKonovnftsyn had understood at once that \nthe news brought was of great importance and \nthat no time must be lost. He did not consider \nor ask himself whether the news was good or \nbad. That did not interest him. He regarded \nthe whole business of the war not with his \nintelligence or his reason but by something \nelse. There was within him a deep unex- \npressed conviction that all would be well, but \nthat one must not trust to this and still less \nspeak about it, but must only attend to one's \nown work. And he did his work, giving his \nwhole strength to the task. \n\nPeter Petr6vich Konovnftsyn, like Dokhtu- \nrov, seems to have been included merely for \npropriety's sake in the list of the so-called \nheroes of 1812 the Barclays, Ra^vskis, Erm6- \nlovs, Pldtovs, and Milordoviches. Like Dokh- \nturov he had the reputation of being a man \nof very limited capacity and information, and \nlike Dokhturov he never made plans of battle \nbut was always found where the situation was \nmost difficult. Since his appointment as gen- \neral on duty he had always slept with his door \nopen, giving orders that every messenger \nshould be allowed to wake him up. In battle \nhe was always under fire, so that Kutuzov re- \nproved him for it and feared to send him to \nthe front, and like Dokhturov he was one of \nthose unnoticed cogwheels that, without clat- \nter or noise, constitute the most essential part \nof the machine. \n\nComing out of the hut into the damp, dark \nnight Konovnitsyn frowned partly from an \nincreased pain in his head and partly at the \nunpleasant thought that occurred to him, of \nhow all that nest of influential men on the \nstaff would be stirred up by this news, espe- \ncially Bennigsen, who ever since Tariitino had \nbeen at daggers drawn with Kutuzov; and how \nthey would make suggestions, quarrel, issue \norders, and rescind them. And this premoni- \ntion was disagreeable to him though he knew \nit could not be helped. \n\nAnd in fact Toll, to whom he went to com- \nmunicate the news, immediately began to ex- \npound his plans to a general sharing his quar- \nters, until Konovnftsyn, who listened in weary \nsilence, reminded him that they must go to \nsee his Highness. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII \n\nKurtizov like all old people did not sleep \nmuch at night. He often fell asleep unex- \npectedly in the daytime, but at night, lying \non his bed without undressing, he generally \nremained awake thinking. \n\nSo he lay now on his bed, supporting his \nlarge, heavy, scarred head on his plump hand, \nwith his one eye open, meditating and peer- \ning into the darkness. \n\nSince Bennigsen, who corresponded with \nthe Emperor and had more influence than \nanyone else on the staff, had begun to avoid \nhim, Kutuzov was more at ease as to the pos- \nsibility of himself and his troops being obliged \nto take part in useless aggressive movements. \nThe lesson of the Tariitino battle and of the \nday before it, which Kutuzov remembered \nwith pain, must, he thought, have some effect \non others too. \n\n"They must understand that we can only \nlose by taking the offensive. Patience and time \nare my warriors, my champions," thought \nKutuzov. He knew that an apple should not \nbe plucked while it is green. It will fall of it- \nself when ripe, but if picked unripe the apple \nis spoiled, the tree is harmed, and your teeth \nare set on edge. Like an experienced sports- \nman he knew that the beast was wounded, and \nwounded as only the whole strength of Russia \ncould have wounded it, but whether it was \nmortally wounded or not was still an unde- \ncided question. Now by the fact of Lauriston \nand BarthtHemi having been sent, and by the \nreports of the guerrillas, Kutuzov was almost \nsure that the wound was mortal. But he needed \nfurther proofs and it was necessary to wait. \n\n"They want to run to see how they have \nwounded it. Wait and we shall see! Continual \nmaneuvers, continual advances!" thought he. \n"What for? Only to distinguish themselves! \nAs if fighting were fun. They are like children \nfrom whom one can't get any sensible account \nof what has happened because they all want \nto show how well they can fight. But that's \nnot what is needed now. \n\n"And what ingenious maneuvers they all \npropose to me! It seems to them that when \nthey have thought of two or three contin- \ngencies" (he remembered the general plan \nsent him from Petersburg) "they have fore- \nseen everything. But the contingencies are \nendless." \n\nThe undecided question as to whether the \nwound inflicted at Borodin6 was mortal or not \nhad hung over Kutuzov's head for a whole \n\n\n\nmonth. On the one hand the French had oc- \ncupied Moscow. On the other Kutiizov felt \nassured with all his being that the terrible \nblow into which he and all the Russians had \nput their whole strength must have been mor- \ntal. But in any case proofs were needed; he \nhad waited a whole month for them and grew \nmore impatient the longer he waited. Lying \non his bed during those sleepless nights he did \njust what he reproached those younger gen- \nerals for doing. He imagined all sorts of pos- \nsible contingencies, just like the younger men, \nbut with this difference, that he saw thousands \nof contingencies instead of two or three and \nbased nothing on them. The longer he \nthought the more contingencies presented \nthemselves. He imagined all sorts of move- \nments of the Napoleonic army as a whole or \nin sections against Petersburg, or against \nhim, or to outflank him. He thought too of \nthe possibility (which he feared most of all) \nthat Napoleon might fight him with his own \nweapon and remain in Moscow awaiting him. \nKutuzov even imagined that Napoleon's army \nmight turn back through Medyn and Yukh- \nnov, but the one thing he could not foresee \nwas what happenedthe insane, convulsive \nstampede of Napoleon's army during its first \neleven days after leaving Moscow: a stampede \nwhich made possible what Kutuzov had not \nyet even dared to think of the complete ex- \ntermination of the French. Dorokhov's report \nabout Broussier's division, the guerrillas' re- \nports of distress in Napoleon's army, rumors \nof preparations for leaving Moscow, all con- \nfirmed the supposition that the French army \nwas beaten and preparing for flight. But these \nwere only suppositions, which seemed im- \nportant to the younger men but not to Kutu- \nzov. With his sixty years' experience he knew \nwhat value to attach to rumors, knew how apt \npeople who desire anything are to group all \nnews so that it appears to confirm what they \ndesire, and he knew how readily in such cases \nthey omit all that makes for the contrary. And \nthe more he desired it the less he allowed him- \nself to believe it. This question absorbed all \nhis mental powers. All else was to him only \nlife's customary routine. To such customary \nroutine belonged his conversations with the \nstaff, the letters he wrote from Tarutino to \nMadame de Stael, the reading of novels, the \ndistribution of awards, his correspondence \nwith Petersburg, and so on. But the destruc- \ntion of the French, which he alone foresaw, \nwas his heart's one desire. \n\n\n\nBOOK THIRTEEN 585 \n\nOn the night of the eleventh of October he \nlay leaning on his arm and thinking of that. \n\nThere was a stir in the next room and he \nheard the steps of Toll, Konovnitsyn, and \nBolkhovftinov. \n\n"Eh, who's there? Come in, come in I What \nnews?" the field marshal called out to them. \n\nWhile a footman was lighting a candle, Toll \ncommunicated the substance of the news. \n\n"Who brought it?" asked Kutuzov with a \nlook which, when the candle was lit, struck \nToll by its cold severity. \n\n"There can be no doubt about it, your High- \nness." \n\n"Call him in, call him here." \n\nKutuzov sat up with one leg hanging down \nfrom the bed and his big paunch resting \nagainst the other which was doubled under \nhim. He screwed up his seeing eye to scrutinize \nthe messenger more carefully, as if wishing to \nread in his face what preoccupied his own \nmind. \n\n"Tell me, tell me, friend," said he to Bolk- \nhovitinov in his low, aged voice, as he pulled \ntogether the shirt which gaped open on his \nchest, "come nearer nearer. What news have \nyou brought me? Eh? That Napoleon has left \nMoscow? Are you sure? Eh?" \n\nBolkhovitinov gave a detailed account from \nthe beginning of all he had been told to re- \nport. \n\n"Speak quicker, quicker! Don't torture \nme!" Kutuzov interrupted him. \n\nBolkhovitinov told him everything and was \nthen silent, awaiting instructions. Toll was be- \nginning to say something but Kutuzov check- \ned him. He tried to say something, but his face \nsuddenly puckered and wrinkled; he waved \nhis arm at Toll and turned to the opposite side \nof the room, to the corner darkened by the \nicons that hung there. \n\n"O Lord, my Creator, Thou has heard our \nprayer . . ." said he in a tremulous voice with \nfolded hands. "Russia is saved. I thank Thee, \nO Lord!" and he wept. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV11I \n\nFROM THE TIME he received this news to the \nend of the campaign all Kutuzov's activity \nwas directed toward restraining his troops, by \nauthority, by guile, and by entreaty, from use- \nless attacks, maneuvers, or encounters with \nthe perishing enemy. Dokhtiirov went to \nMlo-Yarosldvets, but Kuti'izov lingered with \nthe main army and gave orders for the evacua- \ntion of Kaluga a retreat beyond which town \n\n\n\n586 \n\nseemed to him quite possible* \n\nEverywhere Kuttizov retreated, but the en- \nemy without waiting for his retreat fled in the \nopposite direction. \n\nNapoleon's historians describe to us his \nskilled maneuvers at Tarutino and Malo- \nYaroslavets, and make conjectures as to what \nwould have happened had Napoleon been in \ntime to penetrate into the rich southern prov- \ninces. \n\nBut not to speak of the fact that nothing \nprevented him from advancing into those \nsouthern provinces (for the Russian army did \nnot bar his way), the historians forget that \nnothing could have saved his army, for then \nalready it bore within itself the germs of in- \nevitable ruin. How could that army which \nhad found abundant supplies in Moscow and \nhad trampled them underfoot instead of keep- \ning them, and on arriving at Smolensk had \nlooted provisions instead of storing them \nhow could that army recuperate in Kaluga \nprovince, which was inhabited by Russians \nsuch as those who lived in Moscow, and where \nfire had the same property of consuming what \nwas set ablaze? \n\nThat army could not recover anywhere. \nSince the battle of Borodin6 and the pillage of \nMoscow it had borne within itself, as it were, \nthe chemical elements of dissolution. \n\nThe members of what had once been an \narmy Napoleon himself and all his soldiers- \nfled without knowing whither, each concerned \nonly to make his escape as quickly as possible \nfrom this position, of the hopelessness of \nwhich they were all more or less vaguely con- \nscious. \n\nSo it came about that at the council at \nMalo-Yaroslavets, when the generals pretend- \ning to confer together expressed various opin- \nions, all mouths were closed by the opinion \nuttered by the simple-minded soldier Mouton \nwho, speaking last, said what they all felt: \nthat the one thing needful was to get away as \nquickly as possible; and no one, not even \nNapoleon, could say anything against that \ntruth which they all recognized. \n\nBut though they all realized that it was \nnecessary to get away, there still remained a \nfeeling of shame at admitting that they must \nflee. An external shock was needed to over- \ncome that shame, and this shock came in due \ntime. It was what the French called "le hourra \nde I'Empereur" 1 \n\n1 Hourra was the cheer the Russian troops gave \nwhen charging the enemy. TR. \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\nThe day after the council at Mdlo-Yarosla- \nvets Napoleon rode out early in the morning \namid the lines of his army with his suite of \nmarshals and an escort, on the pretext of in- \nspecting the army and the scene of the pre- \nvious and of the impending battle. Some Cos- \nsacks on the prowl for booty fell in with the \nEmperor and very nearly captured him. If the \nCossacks did not capture Napoleon then, what \nsaved him was the very thing that was destroy- \ning the French army, the booty on which the \nCossacks fell. Here as at Tanitino they went \nafter plunder, leaving the men. Disregarding \nNapoleon they rushed after the plunder and \nNapoleon managed to escape. \n\nWhen les enfants du Don might so easily \nhave taken the Emperor himself in the midst \nof his army, it was clear that there was nothing \nfor it but to fly as fast as possible along the \nnearest, familiar road. Napoleon with his \nforty-year-old stomach understood that hint, \nnot feeling his former agility and boldness, \nand under the influence of the fright the Cos- \nsacks had given him he at once agreed with \nMouton and issued orders as the historians \ntell us to retreat by the Smolensk road. \n\nThat Napoleon agreed with Mouton, and \nthat the army retreated, does not prove that \nNapoleon caused it to retreat, but that the \nforces which influenced the whole army and \ndirected it along the Mozhdysk (that is, the \nSmolensk) road acted simultaneously on him \nalso. \n\nCHAPTER XIX \n\nA MAN IN MOTION always devises an aim for \nthat motion. To be able to go a thousand miles \nhe must imagine that something good awaits \nhim at the end of those thousand miles. One \nmust have the prospect of a promised land to \nhave the strength to move. \n\nThe promised land for the French during \ntheir advance had been Moscow, during their \nretreat it was their native land. But that native \nland was too far off, and for a man going a \nthousand miles it is absolutely necessary to \nset aside his final goal and to say to himself: \n"Today I shall get to a place twenty-five miles \noff where I shall rest and spend the night," \nand during the first day's journey that resting \nplace eclipses his ultimate goal and attracts \nall his hopes and desires. And the impulses \nfelt by a single person are always magnified \nin a crowd. \n\nFor the French retreating along the old \nSmolensk road, the final goal their native \n\n\n\nBOOK THIRTEEN \n\n\n\n58? \n\n\n\nland was too remote, and their immediate \ngoal was Smolensk, toward which all their \ndesires and hopes, enormously intensified in \nthe mass, urged them on. It was not that they \nknew that much food and fresh troops await- \ned them in Smolensk, nor that they were told \nso (on the contrary their superior officers, and \nNapoleon himself, knew that provisions were \nscarce there), but because this alone could give \nthem strength to move on and endure their \npresent privations. So both those who knew \nand those who did not know deceived them- \nselves, and pushed on to Smolensk as to a \npromised land. \n\nComing out onto the highroad the French \nfled with surprising energy and unheard-of \nrapidity toward the goal they had fixed on. \nBesides the common impulse which bound \nthe whole crowd of French into one mass and \nsupplied them with a certain energy, there was \nanother cause binding them together their \ngreat numbers. As with the physical law of \ngravity, their enormous mass drew the individ- \nual human atoms to itself. In their hundreds \nof thousands they moved like a whole nation. \n\nEach of them desired nothing more than \nto give himself up as a prisoner to escape from \nall this horror and misery; but on the one \nhand the force of this common attraction to \nSmolensk, their goal, drew each of them in \nthe same direction; on the other hand an \narmy corps could not surrender to a company, \nand though the French availed themselves of \nevery convenient opportunity to detach them- \nselves and to surrender on the slightest decent \npretext, such pretexts did not always occur. \nTheir very numbers and their crowded and \nswift movement deprived them of that possi- \nbility and rendered it not only difficult but \nimpossible for the Russians to stop this move- \nment, to which the French were directing all \ntheir energies. Beyond a certain limit no me- \nchanical disruption of the body could hasten \nthe process of decomposition. \n\nA lump of snow cannot be melted instan- \n\n\n\ntaneously. There is a certain limit of time in \nless than which no amount of heat can melt \nthe snow. On the contrary the greater the heat \nthe more solidified the remaining snow be- \ncomes. \n\nOf the Russian commanders Kutuzov alone \nunderstood this. When the flight of the French \narmy along the Smolensk road became well de- \nfined, what Konovnitsyn had foreseen on the \nnight of the eleventh of October began to oc- \ncur. The superior officers all wanted to dis- \ntinguish themselves, to cut off, to seize, to \ncapture, and to overthrow the French, and all \nclamored for action. \n\nKutuzov alone used all his power (and such \npower is very limited in the case of any com- \nmander in chief) to prevent an attack. \n\nHe could not tell them what we say now: \n"Why fight, why block the road, losing our \nown men and inhumanly slaughtering unfor- \ntunate wretches? What is the use of that, when \na third of their army has melted away on the \nroad from Moscow to Vydzma without any \nbattle?" But drawing from his aged wisdom \nwhat they could understand, he told them of \nthe golden bridge, and they laughed at and \nslandered him, flinging themselves on, rend- \ning and exulting over the dying beast. \n\nErm61ov, Milorddovich, Pldtov, and others \nin proximity to the French near Vydzma could \nnot resist their desire to cut off and break up \ntwo French corps, and by way of reporting \ntheir intention to Kutuzov they sent him a \nblank sheet of paper in an envelope. \n\nAnd try as Kutuzov might to restrain the \ntroops, our men attacked, trying to bar the \nroad. Infantry regiments, we are told, ad- \nvanced to the attack with music and with \ndrums beating, and killed and lost thousands \nof men. \n\nBut they did not cut off or overthrow any- \nbody and the French army, closing up more \nfirmly at the danger, continued, while steadily \nmelting away, to pursue its fatal path to Smo- \ntensk. \n\n\n\nBook Fourteen: 1812 \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I \n\nTHE BATTLE OF BoRODiN6, with the occupation \nof Moscow that followed it and the flight of \nthe French without further conflicts, is one of \nthe most instructive phenomena in history. \n\nAll historians agree that the external activ- \nity of states and nations in their conflicts with \none another is expressed in wars, and that as \na direct result of greater or less success in war \nthe political strength of states and nations in- \ncreases or decreases. \n\nStrange as may be the historical account of \nhow some king or emperor, having quarreled \nwith another, collects an army, fights his \nenemy's army, gains a victory by killing three, \nfive, or ten thousand men, and subjugates a \nkingdom and an entire nation of several mil- \nlions, all the facts of history (as far as we know \nit) confirm the truth of the statement that the \ngreater or lesser success of one army against \nanother is the cause, or at least an essential \nindication, of an increase or decrease in the \nstrength of the nation even though it is un- \nintelligible why the defeat of an army a \nhundredth part of a nation should oblige \nthat whole nation to submit. An army gains a \nvictory, and at once the rights of the conquer- \ning nation have increased to the detriment of \nthe defeated. An army has suffered defeat, and \nat once a people loses its rights in proportion \nto the severity of the reverse, and if its army \nsuffers a complete defeat the nation is quite \nsubjugated. \n\nSo according to history it has been found \nfrom the most ancient times, and so it is to our \nown day. All Napoleon's wars serve to confirm \nthis rule. In proportion to the defeat of the \nAustrian army Austria loses its rights, and the \nrights and the strength of France increase. \nThe victories of the French at Jena and Auer- \nstadt destroy the independent existence of \nPrussia. \n\nBut then, in 1812, the French gain a victory \nnear Moscow. Moscow is taken and after that, \nwith no further battles, it is not Russia that \n\n\n\nceases to exist, but the French army of six \nhundred thousand, and then Napoleonic \nFrance itself. To strain the facts to fit the rules \nof history: to say that the field of battle at \nBorodino remained in the hands of the Rus- \nsians, or that after Moscow there were other \nbattles that destroyed Napoleon's army, is im- \npossible. \n\nAfter the French victory at Borodin6 there \nwas no general engagement nor any that were \nat all serious, yet the French army ceased to \nexist. What does this mean? If it were an ex- \nample taken from the history of China, we \nmight say that it was not an historic phenom- \nenon (which is the historians' usual expedient \nwhen anything does not fit their standards); \nif the matter concerned some brief conflict in \nwhich only a small number of troops took \npart, we might treat it as an exception; but \nthis event occurred before our fathers' eyes, \nand for them it was a question of the life or \ndeath of their fatherland, and it happened in \nthe greatest of all known wars. \n\nThe period of the campaign of 1812 from \nthe battle of Borodino to the expulsion of the \nFrench proved that the winning of a battle \ndoes not produce a conquest and is not even \nan invariable indication of conquest; it proved \nthat the force which decides the fate of peoples \nlies not in the conquerors, nor even in armies \nand battles, but in something else. \n\nThe French historians, describing the con- \ndition of the French army before it left Mos- \ncow, affirm that all was in order in the Grand \nArmy, except the cavalry, the artillery, and the \ntransport there was no forage for the horses \nor the cattle. That was a misfortune no one \ncould remedy, for the peasants of the district \nburned their hay rather than let the French \nhave it. \n\nThe victory gained did not bring the usual \nresults because the peasants Karp and Vlas \n(who after the French had evacuated Moscow \ndrove in their carts to pillage the town, and \nin general personally failed to manifest any \n\n\n\nBOOK FOURTEEN \n\n\n\nheroic feelings), and the whole innumerable \nmultitude of such peasants, did not bring \ntheir hay to Moscow for the high price offered \nthem, but burned it instead. \n\nLet us imagine two men who have come out \nto fight a duel with rapiers according to all \nthe rules of the art of fencing. The fencing has \ngone on for some time; suddenly one of the \ncombatants, feeling himself wounded and \nunderstanding that the matter is no joke but \nconcerns his life, throws down his rapier, \nand seizing the first cudgel that comes to hand \nbegins to brandish it. Then let us imagine that \nthe combatant who so sensibly employed the \nbest and simplest means to attain his end was \nat the same time influenced by traditions of \nchivalry and, desiring to conceal the facts of \nthe case, insisted that he had gained his vic- \ntory with the rapier according to all the rules \nof art. One can imagine what confusion and \nobscurity would result from such an account \nof the duel. \n\nThe fencer who demanded a contest accord- \ning to the rules of fencing was the French \narmy; his opponent who threw away the rapier \nand snatched up the cudgel was the Russian \npeople; those who try to explain the matter \naccording to the rules of fencing are the his- \ntorians who have described the event. \n\nAfter the burning of Smolensk a war began \nwhich did not follow any previous traditions \nof war. The burning of towns and villages, the \nretreats after battles, the blow dealt at Boro- \ndin6 and the renewed retreat, the burning of \nMoscow, the capture of marauders, the seizure \nof transports, and the guerrilla war were all de- \npartures from the rules. \n\nNapoleon felt this, and from the time he \ntook up the correct fencing attitude in Moscow \nand instead of his opponent's rapier saw a \ncudgel raised above his head, he did not cease \nto complain to Kutuzov and to the Emperor \nAlexander that the war was being carried on \ncontrary to all the rules as if there were any \nrules for killing people. In spite of the com- \nplaints of the French as to the nonobservance \nof the rules, in spite of the fact that to some \nhighly placed Russians it seemed rather dis- \ngraceful to fight widi a cudgel and they wanted \nto assume a pose en quarie or en tierce accord- \ning to all the rules, and to make an adroit \nthrust en prime, and so on the cudgel of the \npeople's war was lifted with all its menacing \nand majestic strength, and without consulting \nanyone's tastes or rules and regardless of any- \nthing else, it rose and fell with stupid simplic- \n\n\n\n589 \n\n\n\nity, but consistently, and belabored the French \ntill the whole invasion had perished. \n\nAnd it is well for a people who do not as \nthe French did in 1813 salute according to all \nthe rules of art, and, presenting the hilt of their \nrapier gracefully and politely, hand it to their \nmagnanimous conqueror, but at the moment \nof trial, without asking what rules others have \nadopted in similar cases, simply and easily \npick up the first cudgel that comes to hand and \nstrike with it till the feeling of resentment and \nrevenge in their soul yields to a feeling of con- \ntempt and compassion. \n\nCHAPTER II \n\nONE OF THE MOST obvious and advantageous \ndepartures from the so-called laws of war is the \naction of scattered groups against men pressed \ntogether in a mass. Such action always occurs \nin wars that take on a national character. In \nsuch actions, instead of two crowds opposing \neach other, the men disperse, attack singly, run \naway when attacked by stronger forces, but \nagain attack when opportunity offers. This was \ndone by the guerrillas in Spain, by the moun- \ntain tribes in the Caucasus, and by the Russians \nin 1812. \n\nPeople have called this kind of war "guer- \nrilla warfare" and assume that by so calling it \nthey have explained its meaning. But such a \nwar does not fit in under any rule and is di- \nrectly opposed to a well-known rule of tactics \nwhich is accepted as infallible. That rule says \nthat an attacker should concentrate his forces \nin order to be stronger than his opponent at \nthe moment of conflict. \n\nGuerrilla war (always successful, as history \nshows) directly infringes that rule. \n\nThis contradiction arises from the fact that \nmilitary science assumes the strength of an \narmy to be identical with its numbers. Mili- \ntary science says that the more troops the \ngreater the strength. Les gros bataillons ont \ntou jours raison. 1 \n\nFor military science to say this is like defin- \ning momentum in mechanics by reference to \nthe mass only: stating that momenta are equal \nor unequal to each other simply because the \nmasses involved are equal or unequal. \n\nMomentum (quantity of motion) is the \nproduct of mass and velocity. \n\nIn military affairs the strength of an army is \nthe product of its mass and some unknown x. \n\nMilitary science, seeing in history innumer- \nable instances of the fact that the size of any \n\n1 Large battalions are always victorious. \n\n\n\n590 \n\n\n\narmy does not coincide with its strength and \nthat small detachments defeat larger ones, ob- \nscurely admits the existence of this unknown \nfactor and tries to discover itnow in a geo- \nmetric formation, now in the equipment em- \nployed, now, and most usually, in the genius \nof the commanders. But the assignment of \nthese various meanings to the factor does not \nyield results which accord with the historic \nfacts. \n\nYet it is only necessary to abandon the false \nview (adopted to gratify the "heroes") of the \nefficacy of the directions issued in wartime by \ncommanders, in order to find this unknown \nquantity. \n\nThat unknown quantity is the spirit of the \narmy, that is to say, the greater or lesser readi- \nness to fight and face danger felt by all the \nmen composing an army, quite independently \nof whether they are, or are not, fighting under \nthe command of a genius, in two- or three-line \nformation, with cudgels or with rifles that re- \npeat thirty times a minute. Men who want to \nfight will always put themselves in the most \nadvantageous conditions for fighting. \n\nThe spirit of an army is the factor which \nmultiplied by the mass gives the resulting \nforce. To define and express the significance of \nthis unknown factor the spirit of an army- \nis a problem for science. \n\nThis problem is only solvable if we cease \narbitrarily to substitute for the unknown x \nitself the conditions under which that force \nbecomes apparent such as the commands of \nthe general, the equipment employed, and so \non mistaking these for the real significance of \nthe factor, and if we recognize this unknown \nquantity in its entirety as being the greater or \nlesser desire to fight and to face danger. Only \nthen, expressing known historic facts by equa- \ntions and comparing the relative significance \nof this factor, can we hope to define the un- \nknown. \n\nTen men, battalions, or divisions, fighting \nfifteen men, battalions, or divisions, conquer- \nthat is, kill or take captive all the others, \nwhile themselves losing four, so that on the \none side four and on the other fifteen were \nlost. Consequently the four were equal to the \nfifteen, and therefore 4x=i5)j. Consequently \nx/y=i$/4. This equation does not give us the \nvalue of the unknown factor but gives us a \nratio between two unknowns. And by bring- \ning variously selected historic units (battles, \ncampaigns, periods of war) into such equa- \ntions, a series of numbers could be obtained in \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\nwhich certain laws should exist and might be \ndiscovered. \n\nThe tactical rule that an army should act in \nmasses when attacking, and in smaller groups \nin retreat, unconsciously confirms the truth \nthat the strength of an army depends on its \nspirit. To lead men forward under fire more \ndiscipline (obtainable only by movement in \nmasses) is needed than is needed to resist at- \ntacks. But this rule which leaves out of account \nthe spirit of the army continually proves in- \ncorrect and is in particularly striking contrast \nto the facts when some strong rise or fall in the \nspirit of the troops occurs, as in all national \nwars. \n\nThe French, retreating in 1812 though ac- \ncording to tactics they should have separated \ninto detachments to defend themselves con- \ngregated into a mass because the spirit of the \narmy had so fallen that only the mass held the \narmy together. The Russians, on the contrary, \nought according to tactics to have attacked in \nmass, but in fact they split up into small units, \nbecause their spirit had so risen that separate \nindividuals, without orders, dealt blows at the \nFrench without needing any compulsion to in- \nduce them to expose themselves to hardships \nand dangers. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER III \n\nTHE SO-CALLED PARTISAN WAR began with the \nentry of the French into Smolensk. \n\nBefore partisan warfare had been officially \nrecognized by the government, thousands of \nenemy stragglers, marauders, and foragers had \nbeen destroyed by the Cossacks and the peas- \nants, who killed them off as instinctively as dogs \nworry a stray .mad dog to death. Denis Davy- \ndov, with his Russian instinct, was the first to \nrecognize the value of this terrible cudgel \nwhich regardless of the rules of military sci- \nence destroyed the French, and to him belongs \nthe credit for taking the first step toward regu- \nlarizing this method of warfare. \n\nOn August 24 Davydov's first partisan de- \ntachment was formed and then others were \nrecognized. The further the campaign pro- \ngressed the more numerous these detachments \nbecame. \n\nThe irregulars destroyed the great army \npiecemeal. They gathered the fallen leaves that \ndropped of themselves from that withered tree \nthe French army and sometimes shook that \ntree itself. By October, when the French were \nfleeing toward Smolensk, there were hundreds \nof such companies, of various sizes and char- \n\n\n\nBOOK FOURTEEN \n\nicters. There were some that adopted all the \nirmy methods and had infantry, artillery, \nrtaffs, and the comforts of life. Others con- \nsisted solely of Cossack cavalry. There were \nalso small scratch groups of foot and horse, and \ngroups of peasants and landowners that re- \nmained unknown. A sacristan commanded one \nparty which captured several hundred prison- \ners in the course of a month; and there was \nVasilfsa, the wife of a village elder, who slew \nhundreds of the French. \n\nThe partisan warfare flamed up most fiercely \nIn the latter daysof October. Its first period had \npassed: when the partisans themselves, amazed \nat their own boldness, feared every minute to \nbe surrounded and captured by the French, \nand hid in the forests without unsaddling, \nhardly daring to dismount and always expect- \ning to be pursued. By the end of October this \nkind of warfare had taken definite shape: it \nhad become clear to all what could be ventured \nagainst the French and what could not. Now \nonly the commanders of detachments with \nstaffs, and moving according to rules at a dis- \ntance from the French, still regarded many \nthings as impossible. The small bands that had \nstarted their activities long before and had al- \nready observed the French closely considered \nthings possible which the commanders of the \nbig detachments did not dare to contemplate. \nThe Cossacks and peasants who crept in among \nthe French now considered everything possible. \n\nOn October 22, Denisov (who was one of \nthe irregulars) was with his group at the height \nof the guerrilla enthusiasm. Since early morn- \ning he and his party had been on the move. \nAll day long he had been watching from the \nforest that skirted the highroad a large French \nconvoy of cavalry baggage and Russian prison- \ners separated from the rest of the army, which \nas was learned from spies and prisoners was \nmoving under a strong escort to Smolensk. Be- \nsides Denisov and D61okhov (who also led a \nsmall party and moved in Denisov's vicinity), \nthe commanders of some large divisions with \nstaffs also knew of this convoy and, as Denfsov \nexpressed it, were sharpening their teeth for \nit. Two of the commanders of large parties- \none a Pole and the other a German sent in- \nvitations to Denisov almost simultaneously, re- \nquesting him to join up with their divisions \nto attack the convoy. \n\n"No, bwother, I have gwown mustaches my- \nself," said Denisov on reading these docu- \nments, and he wrote to the German that, de- \nspite his heartfelt desire to serve under so val- \n\n\n\n591 \n\niant and renowned a general, he had to forgo \nthat pleasure because he was already under the \ncommand of the Polish general. To the Polish \ngeneral he replied to the same effect, inform- \ning him that he was already under the com- \nmand of the German. \n\nHaving arranged matters thus, Denfsov and \nD61okhov intended, without reporting mat- \nters to the higher command, to attack and \nseize that convoy with their own small forces. \nOn October 22 it was moving from the village \nof Mikiilino to that of Shamshevo. To the left \nof the road between Mikulino and Shdmshevo \nthere were large forests, extending in some \nplaces up to the road itself though in others a \nmile or more back from it. Through these \nforests Denfsov and his party rode all day, \nsometimes keeping well back in them and \nsometimes coming to the very edge, but never \nlosing sight of the moving French. That morn- \ning, Cossacks of Denisov's party had seized \nand carried off into the forest two wagons \nloaded with cavalry saddles, which had stuck \nin the mud not far from Mikulino where the \nforest ran close to the road. Since then, and \nuntil evening, the party had watched the move- \nments of the French without attacking. It was \nnecessary to let the French reach Shdmshevo \nquietly without alarming them and then, after \njoining Dolokhov who was to come that eve- \nning to a consultation at a watchman's hut in \nthe forest less than a mile from Shamshevo, to \nsurprise the French at dawn, falling like an \navalanche on their heads from two sides, and \nrout and capture them all at one blow. \n\nIn their rear, more than a mile from Miku- \nlino where the forest came right up to the \nroad, six Cossacks were posted to report if any \nfresh columns of French should show them- \nselves. \n\nBeyond Shdmshevo, D61okhov was to observe \nthe road in the same way, to find out at what \ndistance there were other French troops. They \nreckoned that the convoy had fifteen hundred \nmen. Denfsov had two hundred, and D61okhov \nmight have as many more, but the disparity \nof numbers did not deter Denisov. All that he \nnow wanted to know was what troops these \nwere and to learn that he had to capture a \n"tongue" that is, a man from the enemy col- \numn. That morning's attack on the wagons \nhad been made so hastily that the Frenchmen \nwith the wagons had all been killed; only a \nlittle drummer boy had been taken alive, and \nas he was a straggler he could tell them noth- \ning definite about the troops in that column. \n\n\n\n59* \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nDenisov considered it dangerous to make a \nsecond attack for fear of putting the whole \ncolumn on the alert, so he sent Tikhon Shcher- \nbaty, a peasant of his party, to Shdmshevo to \ntry and seize at least one of the French quarter- \nmasters who had been sent on in advance. \n\nCHAPTER IV \n\nIT WAS a warm rainy autumn day. The sky and \nthe horizon were both the color of muddy \nwater. At times a sort of mist descended, and \nthen suddenly heavy slanting rain came down. \n\nDenisov in a felt cloak and a sheepskin cap \nfrom which the rain ran down was riding a \nthin thoroughbred horse with sunken sides. \nLike his horse, which turned its head and laid \nits ears back, he shrank from the driving rain \nand gazed anxiously before him. His thin face \nwith its short, thick black beard looked angry. \n\nBeside Denisov rode an esaul, 1 Denfsov's \nfellow worker, also in felt cloak and sheepskin \ncap, and riding a large sleek Don horse. \n\nEsaul Lovdyski the Third was a tall man as \nstraight as an arrow, pale-faced, fair-haired, \nwith narrow light eyes and with calm self-satis- \nfaction in his face and bearing. Though it was \nimpossible to say in what the peculiarity of the \nhorse and rider lay, yet at first glance at the \nesaul and Denfsov one saw that the latter \nwas wet and uncomfortable and was a man \nmounted on a horse, while looking at the esaul \none saw that he was as comfortable and as \nmuch at ease as always and that he was not a \nman who had mounted a horse, but a man who \nwas one with his horse, a being consequently \npossessed of twofold strength. \n\nA little ahead of them walked a peasant \nguide, wet to the skin and wearing a gray \npeasant coat and a white knitted cap. \n\nA little behind, on a poor, small, lean Kirg- \nhiz mount with an enormous tail and mane \nand a bleeding mouth, rode a young officer in \na blue French overcoat. \n\nBeside him rode an hussar, with a boy in a \ntattered French uniform and blue cap behind \nhim on the crupper of his horse. The boy held \non to the hussar with cold, red hands, and rais- \ning his eyebrows gazed about him with sur- \nprise. This was the French drummer boy cap- \ntured that morning. \n\nBehind them along the narrow, sodden, cut- \nup forest road came hussars in threes and fours, \nand then Cossacks: some in felt cloaks, some \nin French greatcoats, and some with horse- \ncloths over their heads. The horses, being \n\n1 A captain of Cossacks. \n\n\n\ndrenched by the rain, all looked black whether \nchestnut or bay. Their necks, with their wet, \nclose-clinging manes, looked strangely thin. \nSteam rose from them. Clothes, saddles, reins, \nwere all wet, slippery, and sodden, like the \nground and the fallen leaves that strewed the \nroad. The men sat huddled up trying not to \nstir, so as to warm the water that had trickled \nto their bodies and not admit the fresh cold \nwater that was leaking in under their seats, \ntheir knees, and at the back of their necks. In \nthe midst of the outspread line of Cossacks two \nwagons, drawn by French horses and by saddled \nCossack horses that had been hitched on in \nfront, rumbled over the tree stumps and \nbranches and splashed through the water that \nlay in the ruts. \n\nDenisov's horse swerved aside to avoid a \npool in the track and bumped his rider's knee \nagainst a tree. \n\n"Oh, the devil!" exclaimed Denisov angrily, \nand showing his teeth he struck his horse three \ntimes with his whip, splashing himself and his \ncomrades with mud. \n\nDenisov was out of sorts both because of the \nrain and also from hunger (none of them had \neaten anything since morning), and yet more \nbecause he still had no news from D61okhov \nand the man sent to capture a "tongue" had \nnot returned. \n\n"There'll hardly be another such chance to \nfall on a transport as today. It's too risky to at- \ntack them by oneself, and if we put it off till an- \nother day one of the big guerrilla detachments \nwill snatch the prey from under our noses," \nthought Denisov, continually peering forward, \nhoping to see a messenger from D61okhov. \n\nOn coming to a path in the forest along \nwhich he could see far to the right, Denisov \nstopped. \n\n"There's someone coming," said he. \n\nThe esaul looked in the direction Denfsov \nindicated. \n\n"There are two, an officer and a Cossack. But \nit is not presupposable that it is the lieutenant \ncolonel himself," said the esaul, who was fond \nof using words the Cossacks did not know. \n\nThe approaching riders having descended \na decline were no longer visible, but they re- \nappeared a few minutes later. In front, at a \nweary gallop and using his leather whip, rode \nan officer, disheveled and drenched, whose \ntrousers had worked up to above his knees. Be- \nhind him, standing in the stirrups, trotted a \nCossack. The officer, a very young lad with a \nbroad rosy face and keen merry eyes, galloped \n\n\n\nBOOK FOURTEEN \n\nup to Denisov and handed him a sodden en- \n\n\n\n593 \n\n\n\nvelope. \n\n"From the general," said the officer. "Please \nexcuse its not being quite dry." \n\nDenfsov, frowning, took the envelope and \nopened it. \n\n"There, they kept telling us: 'It's dangerous, \nit's dangerous,' " said the officer, addressing \nthe esaul while Denfsov was reading the dis- \npatch. "But Komar6v and I" he pointed to \nthe Cossack "were prepared. We have each \n\nof us two pistols But what's this?" he asked, \n\nnoticing the French drummer boy. "A pris- \noner? You've already been in action? May I \nspeak to him?" \n\n"Wost6v! Ptya!" exclaimed Denisov, hav- \ning run through the dispatch. "Why didn't you \nsay who you were?" and turning with a smile \nhe held out his hand to the lad. \n\nThe officer was Pe" tya Rost6v. \n\nAll the way Ptya had been preparing him- \nself to behave with Denisov as befitted a grown- \nup man and an officer without hinting at \ntheir previous acquaintance. But as soon as \nDenfsov smiled at him Petya brightened up, \nblushed with pleasure, forgot the official man- \nner he had been rehearsing, and began telling \nhim how he had already been in a battle near \nVydzma and how a certain hussar had distin- \nguished himself there. \n\n"Well, I am glad to see you," Denisov inter- \nrupted him, and his face again assumed its \nanxious expression. \n\n"Michael Feoklftych," said he to the esaul, \n"this is again fwom that German, you know. \nHe" he indicated Pdtya "is serving under \nhim." \n\nAnd Denisov told the esaul that the dis- \npatch just delivered was a repetition of the Ger- \nman general's demand that he should join \nforces with him for an attack on the transport. \n\n"If we don't take it tomowwow, he'll snatch \nit fwom under our noses," he added. \n\nWhile Denisov was talking to the esaul, \nPdtya abashed by Denisov's cold tone and \nsupposing that it was due to the condition of \nhis trousers furtively tried to pull them down \nunder his greatcoat so that no one should no- \ntice it, while maintaining as martial an air as \npossible. \n\n"Will there be any orders, your honor?" he \nasked Denfsov, holding his hand at the salute \nand resuming the game of adjutant and gen- \neral for which he had prepared himself, "or \nshall I remain with your honor?" \n\n"Orders?" Denfsov repeated thoughtfully. \n\n\n\nBut can you stay till tomowwow?" \n"Oh, please . . . May I stay with you?" cried \n\n\n\n"But, just what did the genewal tell you? \nTo weturn at once?" asked Denfsov. \n\nP&lt;kya blushed. \n\n"He gave me no instructions. I think I \ncould?" he returned, inquiringly. \n\n"Well, all wight," said Denfsov. \n\nAnd turning to his men he directed a party \nto go on to the halting place arranged near the \nwatchman's hut in the forest, and told the \nofficer on the Kirghiz horse (who performed \nthe duties of an adjutant) to go and find out \nwhere D61okhov was and whether he would \ncome that evening. Denisov himself intended \ngoing with the esaul and P(hya to the edge of \nthe forest where it reached out to Shamshevo, \nto have a look at the part of the French biv- \nouac they were to attack next day. \n\n"Well, old fellow," said he to the peasant \nguide, "lead us to Shamshevo." \n\nDenisov, PeHya, and the esaul, accompanied \nby some Cossacks and the hussar who had the \nprisoner, rode to the left across a ravine to the \nedge of the forest. \n\nCHAPTER V \n\nTHE RAIN HAD STOPPED, and only the mist was \nfalling and drops from the trees. Denisov, the \nesaul, and Pckya rode silently, following the \npeasant in the knitted cap who, stepping \nlightly with outturned toes and moving noise- \nlessly in his bast shoes over the roots and wet \nleaves, silently led them to the edge of the \nforest. \n\nHe ascended an incline, stopped, looked \nabout him, and advanced to where the screen \nof trees was less dense. On reaching a large \noak tree that had not yet shed its leaves, he \nstopped and beckoned mysteriously to them \nwith his hand. \n\nDenisov and Pckya rode up to him. From the \nspot where the peasant was standing they could \nsee the French. Immediately beyond the forest, \non a downward slope, lay a field of spring rye. \nTo the right, beyond a steep ravine, was a \nsmall village and a landowner's house with a \nbroken roof. In the village, in the house, in the \ngarden, by the well, by the pond, over all the \nrising ground, and all along the road uphill \nfrom the bridge leading to the village, not \nmore than five hundred yards away, crowds of \nmen could be seen through the shimmering \nmist. Their un-Russian shouting at their horses \nwhich were straining uphill with the carts, and \n\n\n\n594 \n\ntheir calls to one another, could be clearly \n\nheard. \n\n"Bwing the prisoner here," said Denfsov in \na low voice, not taking his eyes off the French. \n\nA Cossack dismounted, lifted the boy down, \nand took him to Denfsov. Pointing to the \nFrench troops, Denisov asked him what these \nand those of them were. The boy, thrusting his \ncold hands into his pockets and lifting his eye- \nbrows, looked at Denisov in affright, but in \nspite of an evident desire to say all he knew \ngave confused answers, merely assenting to \neverything Denfsov asked him. Denfsov turned \naway from him frowning and addressed the \nesaul, conveying his own conjectures to him. \n\nP&lt;kya, rapidly turning his head, looked now \nat the drummer boy, now at Denisov, now at \nthe esaul, and now at the French in the village \nand along the road, trying not to miss any- \nthing of importance. \n\n"Whether Dolokhov comes or not, we must \nseize it, eh?" said Denfsov with a merry sparkle \nin his eyes. \n\n"It is a very suitable spot," said the esaul. \n\n"We'll send the iniantwy down by the \nswamps," Denisov continued. "They'll cweep \nup to the garden; you'll wide up fwom there \nwith the Cossacks" he pointed to a spot in the \nforest beyond the village "and I with my hus- \nsars fwom here. And at the signal shot . . ." \n\n"The hollow is impassable there's a swamp \nthere," said the esaul. "The horses would sink. \nWe must ride round more to the left. . . ." \n\nWhile they were talking in undertones the \ncrack of a shot sounded from the low ground \nby the pond, a puff of white smoke appeared, \nthen another, and the sound of hundreds of \nseemingly merry French voices shouting to- \ngether came up from the slope. For a moment \nDenfsov and the esaul drew back. They were \nso near that they thought they were the cause \nof the firing and shouting. But the firing and \nshouting did not relate to them. Down below, \na man wearing something red was running \nthrough the marsh. The French were evidently \nfiring and shouting at him. \n\n"Why, that's our Tfkhon," said the esaul. \n\n"So it is! It is!" \n\n"The wascall" said Denfsov. \n\n"He'll get away!" said the esaul, screwing up \nhis eyes. \n\nThe man whom they called Tfkhon, having \nrun to the stream, plunged in so that the water \nsplashed in the air, and, having disappeared \nfor an instant, scrambled out on all fours, all \nblack with the wet, and ran on. The French \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\nwho had been pursuing him stopped. \n\n"Smart, that!" said the esaul. \n\n"What a beast!" said Denfsov with his \nformer look of vexation. "What has he been \ndoing all this time?" \n\n"Who is he?" asked P&lt;hya. \n\n"He's our plastun. 1 1 sent him to capture a \n'tongue.' " \n\n"Oh, yes," said P^tya, nodding at the first \nwords Denfsov uttered as if he understood it \nall, though he really did not understand any- \nthing of it. \n\nTfkhon Shcherbdty was one of the most in- \ndispensable men in their band. He was a peas- \nant from Pokr6vsk, near theriver Gzhat. When \nDenfsov had come to Pokr6vsk at the begin- \nning of his operations and had as usual sum- \nmoned the village elder and asked him what \nhe knew about the French, the elder, as though \nshielding himself, had replied, as all village \nelders did, that he had neither seen nor heard \nanything of them. But when Denfsov explained \nthat his purpose was to kill the French, and \nasked if no French had strayed that way, the \nelder replied that some "more-orderers" had \nreally been at their village, but that Tfkhon \nShcherbaty was the only man who dealt with \nsuch matters. Denfsov had Tfkhon called and, \nhaving praised him for his activity, said a few \nwords in the elder's presence about loyalty to \nthe Tsar and the country and the hatred of \nthe French that all sons of the fatherland \nshould cherish. \n\n"We don't do the French any harm," said \nTfkhon, evidently frightened by Denfsov's \nwords. "We only fooled about with the lads \nfor fun, you know! We killed a score or so of \n'more-orderers,' but we did no harm else. . . ." \n\nNext day when Denfsov had left Pokr6vsk, \nhaving quite forgotten about this peasant, it \nwas reported to him that Tfkhon had attached \nhimself to their party and asked to be allowed \nto remain with it. Denfsov gave orders to let \nhim do so. \n\nTfkhon, who at first did rough work, laying \ncampfires, fetching water, flaying dead horses, \nand so on, soon showed a great liking and \naptitude for partisan warfare. At night he \nwould go out for booty and always brought \nback French clothing and weapons, and when \ntold to would bring in French captives also. \nDenfsov then relieved him from drudgery and \nbegan taking him with him when he went out \non expeditions and had him enrolled among \nthe Cossacks. \n\n1 An unmounted sharpshooter. TR. \n\n\n\nBOOK FOURTEEN \n\n\n\n595 \n\n\n\nTfkhon did not like riding, and always went \non foot, never lagging behind the cavalry. He \nwas armed with a musketoon (which he car- \nried rather as a joke), a pike and an ax, which \nlatter he used as a wolf uses its teeth, with equal \nease picking fleas out of its fur or crunching \nthick bones. Tikhon with equal accuracy would \nsplit logs with blows at arm's length, or hold- \ning the head of the ax would cut thin little \npegs or carve spoons. In Denfsov's party he \nheld a peculiar and exceptional position. When \nanything particularly difficult or nasty had to \nbe done to push a cart out of the mud with \none's shoulders, pull a horse out of a swamp by \nits tail, skin it, slink in among the French, or \nwalk more than thirty miles in a day every- \nbody pointed laughingly at Tikhon. \n\n"It won't hurt that devil he's as strong as a \nhorse!" they said of him. \n\nOnce a Frenchman Tikhon was trying to \ncapture fired a pistol at him and shot him in the \nfleshy part of the back. That wound (which \nTfkhon treated only with internal and exter- \nnal applications of vodka) was the subject of \nthe liveliest jokes by the whole detachment- \njokes in which Tfkhon readily joined. \n\n"Hallo, matel Never again? Gave you a \ntwist?" the Cossacks would banter him. And \nTfkhon, purposely writhing and making faces, \npretended to be angry and swore at the French \nwith the funniest curses. The only effect of this \nincident on Tfkhon was that after being \nwounded he seldom brought in prisoners. \n\nHe was the bravest and most useful man in \nthe party. No one found more opportunities \nfor attacking, no one captured or killed more \nFrenchmen, and consequently he was made the \nbuffoon of all the Cossacks and hussars and \nwillingly accepted that role. Now he had been \nsent by Denfsov overnight to Shamshevo to \ncapture a "tongue." But whether because he \nhad not been content to take only one French- \nman or because he had slept through the night, \nhe had crept by day into some bushes right \namong the French and, as Denfsov had wit- \nnessed from above, had been detected by them. \n\nCHAPTER VI \n\nAFTER TALKING for some time with the esaul \nabout next day's attack, which now, seeing \nhow near they were to the French, he seemed \nto have definitely decided on, Denfsov turned \nhis horse and rode back. \n\n"Now, my lad, we'll go and get dwy," he said \nto P6tya. \n\nAs they approached the watchhouse Denfsov \n\n\n\nstopped, peering into the forest. Among the \ntrees a man with long legs and long, swinging \narms, wearing a short jacket, bast shoes, and \na Kazan hat, was approaching with long, light \nsteps. He had a musketoon over his shoulder \nand an ax stuck in his girdle. When he espied \nDenfsov he hastily threw something into the \nbushes, removed his sodden hat by its floppy \nbrim, and approached his commander. It was \nTfkhon. His wrinkled and pockmarked face \nand narrow little eyes beamed with self-satisfied \nmerriment. He lifted his head high and gazed \nat Denfsov as if repressing a laugh. \n\n"Well, where did you disappear to?" in- \nquired Denfsov. \n\n"Where did I disappear to? I went to get \nFrenchmen," answered Tikhon boldly and \nhurriedly, in a husky but melodious bass \nvoice. \n\n"Why did you push yourself in there by day- \nlight? You ass! Well, why haven't you taken \none?" \n\n"Oh, I took one all right," said Tfkhon. \n"Where is he?" \n\n"You see, I took him first thing at dawn," \nTfkhon continued, spreading out his flat feet \nwith outturned toes in their bast shoes. "I took \nhim into the forest. Then I see he's no good \nand think I'll go and fetch a likelier one." \n\n"You see? . . . What a wogue it's just as I \nthought," said Denisov to the esaul. "Why \ndidn't you bwing that one?" \n\n"What was the good of bringing him?" \nTfkhon interrupted hastily and angrily "that \none wouldn't have done for you. As if I don't \nknow what sort you want!" \n\n"What a bwute you are! . . . Well?" \n"I went for another one," Tfkhon con- \ntinued, "and I creptlike this through the wood \nand lay down." (He suddenly lay down on his \nstomach with a supple movement to show how \nhe had done it.) "One turned up and I grabbed \nhim, like this." (He jumped up quickly and \nlightly.) " 'Come along to the colonel/ I said. \nHe starts yelling, and suddenly there were \nfour of them. They rushed at me with their \nlittle swords. So I went for them with my ax, \nthis way: 'What are you up to?' says I. 'Christ \nbe with you!' " shouted Tfkhon, waving his \narms with an angry scowl and throwing out his \nchest. \n\n"Yes, we saw from the hill how you took to \nyour heels through the puddles!" said the \nesaul, screwing up his glittering eyes. \n\nPtya badly wanted to laugh, but noticed \nthat they all refrained from laughing. He \n\n\n\n596 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nturned his eyes rapidly from Tikhon's face to \nthe esaul's and Denfsov's, unable to make out \nwhat it all meant. \n\n"Don't play the fool!" said Denfsov, cough- \ning angrily. "Why didn't you bwing the first \none?" \n\nTikhon scratched his back with one hand \nand his head with the other, then suddenly his \nwhole face expanded into a beaming, foolish \ngrin, disclosing a gap where he had lost a tooth \n(that was why he was called Shcherbaty the \ngap-toothed). Denfsov smiled, and Ptya burst \ninto a peal of merry laughter in which Tikhon \nhimself joined. \n\n"Oh, but he was a regular good-for-nothing," \nsaid Tfkhon. "The clothes on him poor stuff! \nHow could I bring him? And so rude, your \nhonor! Why, he says: 'I'm a general's son my- \nself, I won't go!' he says." \n\n"You are a bwute!" said Denisov. "I wanted \nto question . . ." \n\n"But I questioned him," said Tikhon. "He \nsaid he didn't know much. 'There are a lot of \nus,' he says, 'but all poor stuff only soldiers in \nname,' he says. 'Shout loud at them,' he says, \n'and you'll take them all,' " Tikhon concluded, \nlooking cheerfully and resolutely into Deni- \nsov's eyes. \n\n"I'll give you ahundwedsharp lashes that'll \nteach you to play the fool!" said Denisov \nseverely. \n\n"But why are you angry?" remonstrated \nTfkhon, "just as if I'd never seen your French- \nmen! Only wait till it gets dark and I'll fetch \nyou any of them you want three if you like." \n\n"Well, let's go," said Denisov, and rode all \nthe way to the watchhouse in silence and \nfrowning angrily. \n\nTikhon followed behind and P^tya heard \nthe Cossacks laughing with him and at him, \nabout some pair of boots he had thrown into \nthe bushes. \n\nWhen the fit of laughter that had seized him \nat Tfkhon's words and smile had passed and \nPtya realized for a moment that this Tfkhon \nhad killed a man, he felt uneasy. He looked \nround at the captive drummer boy and felt a \npang in his heart. But this uneasiness lasted \nonly a moment. He felt it necessary to hold his \nhead higher, to brace himself, and to ques- \ntion the esaul with an air of importance about \ntomorrow's undertaking, that he might not be \nunworthy of the company in which he found \nhimself. \n\nThe officer who had been sent to inquire \nmet Denfsov on the way with the news that \n\n\n\nD61okhov was soon coming and that all was \nwell with him. \n\nDenfsovat once cheered upand, calling Ptya \nto him, said: "Well, tell me about yourself." \n\nCHAPTER VII \n\nPTYA, HAVING LEFT his people after their de- \nparture from Moscow, joined his regiment and \nwas soon taken as orderly by a general com- \nmanding a large guerrilla detachment. From \nthe time he received his commission, and espe- \ncially since he had joined the active army and \ntaken part in the battle of Vyazma, Pe*tya had \nbeen in a constant state of blissful excitement \nat being grown-up and in a perpetual ecstatic \nhurry not to miss any chance to do something \nreally heroic. He was highly delighted with \nwhat he saw and experienced in the army, but \nat the same time it always seemed to him that \nthe really heroic exploits were being per- \nformed just where he did not happen to be. \nAnd he was always in a hurry to get where he \nwas not. \n\nWhen on the twenty-first of October his gen- \neral expressed a wish to send somebody to \nDenisov's detachment, P^tya begged so pite- \nously to be sent that the general could not re- \nfuse. But when dispatching him he recalled \nP^tya's mad action at the battle of VyAzma, \nwhere instead of riding by the road to the place \nto which he had been sent, he had galloped to \nthe advanced line under the fire of the French \nand had there twice fired his pistol. So now \nthe general explicitly forbade his taking part \nin any action whatever of Denfsov's. That was \nwhy Pchya had blushed and grown confused \nwhen Denfsov asked him whether he could \nstay. Before they had ridden to the outskirts \nof the forest P^tya had considered that he must \ncarry out his instructions strictly and return at \nonce. But when he saw the French and saw \nTikhon and learned that there would certainly \nbe an attack that night, he decided, with the \nrapidity with which young people change their \nviews, that the general, whom he had greatly \nrespected till then, was a rubbishy German, \nthat Denfsov was a hero, the esaul a hero, and \nTfkhon a hero too, and that it would be shame- \nful for him to leave them at a moment of dif- \nficulty. \n\nIt was already growing dusk when Denfsov, \nPtya, and the esaul rode up to the watchhouse. \nIn the twilight saddled horses could be seen, \nand Cossacks and hussars who had rigged up \nrough shelters in the glade and were kindling \nglowing fires in a hollow of the forest where \n\n\n\nBOOK FOURTEEN \n\n\n\n597 \n\n\n\nthe French could not see the smoke. In the \npassage of the small watchhouse a Cossack with \nsleeves rolled up was chopping some mutton. \nIn the room three officers of Denisov's band \nwere converting a door into a tabletop. Ptya \ntook off his wet clothes, gave them to be dried, \nand at once began helping the officers to fix up \nthe dinner table. \n\nIn ten minutes the table was ready and a \nnapkin spread on it. On the table were vodka, \na flask of rum, white bread, roast mutton, and \nsalt. \n\nSitting at table with the officers and tearing \nthe fat savory mutton with his hands, down \nwhich the grease trickled, Ptya was in an \necstatic childish state of love for all men, and \nconsequently of confidence that others loved \nhim in the same way. \n\n"So then what do you think, Vasfli Dmf- \ntrich?" said he to Denfsov. "It's all right my \nstaying a day with you?" And not waiting for \na reply he answered his own question: "You \nsee I was told to find out well, I am finding \nout. . . . Only do let me into the very . . . into \nthe chief ... I don't want a reward. . . . But I \nwant . . ." \n\nPtya clenched his teeth and looked around, \nthrowing back his head and flourishing his \narms. \n\n"Into the vewy chief . . ." Denisov repeated \nwith a smile. \n\n"Only, please let me command something, \nso that I may really command . . ." Ptya went \non. "What would it be to you? . . . Oh, you \nwant a knife?" he said, turning to an officer \nwho wished to cut himself a piece of mutton. \n\nAnd he handed him his clasp knife. The \nofficer admired it. \n\n"Please keep it. I have several like it," said \nPtya, blushing. "Heavens! I was quite for- \ngetting!" he suddenly cried. "I have some rai- \nsins, fine ones; you know, seedless ones. We \nhave a new sutler and he has such capital \nthings. I bought ten pounds. I am used to \nsomething sweet. Would you like some? . . ." \nand Ptya ran out into the passage to his Cos- \nsack and brought back some bags which con- \ntained about five pounds of raisins. "Have \nsome, gentlemen, have some!" \n\n"You want a coffeepot, don't you?" he asked \nthe esaul "I bought a capital one from our \nsutler! He has splendid things. And he's very \nhonest, that's the chief thing. I'll be sure to \nsend it to you. Or perhaps your flints are giv- \ning out, or are worn out that happens some- \ntimes, you know. I have brought some with \n\n\n\nme, here they are" and he showed a bag "a \nhundred flints. I bought them very cheap. \nPlease take as many as you want, or all if you \nlike " \n\nThen suddenly, dismayed lest he had said \ntoo much, Ptya stopped and blushed. \n\nHe tried to remember whether he had not \ndone anything else that was foolish. And run- \nning over the events of the day he remembered \nthe French drummer boy. "It's capital for us \nhere, but what of him? Where have they put \nhim? Have they fed him? Haven't they hurt \nhis feelings?" he thought. But having caught \nhimself saying too much about the flints, he \nwas now afraid to speak out. \n\n"I might ask," he thought, "but they'll say: \n'He's a boy himself and so he pities the boy.' \nI'll show them tomorrow whether I'm a boy. \nWill it seem odd if I ask?" Ptya thought. \n"Well, never mind!" and immediately, blush- \ning and looking anxiously at the officers to see \nif they appeared ironical, he said: \n\n"May I call in that boy who was taken pris- \noner and give him something to eat? . . . Per- \nhaps . . ." \n\n"Yes, he's a poor little fellow," said Denisov, \nwho evidently saw nothing shameful in this \nreminder. "Call him in. His name is Vincent \nBosse. Have him fetched." \n\n"I'll call him," said Pekya. \n\n"Yes, yes, call him. A poor little fellow," \n' Denisov repeated. \n\nPtya was standing at the door when Denisov \nsaid this. He slipped in between the officers, \ncame close to Denisov, and said: \n\n"Let me kiss you, dear old fellow! Oh, how \nfine, how splendid!" \n\nAnd having kissed Denfsov he ran out of the \nhut. \n\n"Bosse! Vincent!" Ptya cried, stopping out- \nside the door. \n\n"Who do you want, sir?" asked a voice in \nthe darkness. \n\nPtya replied that he wanted the French lad \nwho had been captured that day. \n\n"Ah, Ves^nny?" said a Cossack. \n\nVincent, the boy's name, had already been \nchanged by the Cossacks into Vestnny (vernal) \nand into Vestnya by the peasants and soldiers. \nIn both these adaptations the reference to \nspring (vesnd) matched the impression made \nby the young lad. \n\n"He is warming himself there by the bon- \nfire. Ho, Vesnyal Vesnyal Ves^nny!" laugh- \ning voices were heard calling to one another \nin the darkness* \n\n\n\n598 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\n"He's a smart lad," said an hussar standing \nnear Ptya. "We gave him something to eat \na while ago. He was awfully hungry!" \n\nThe sound of bare feet splashing through \nthe mud was heard in the darkness, and the \ndrummer boy came to the door. \n\n"Ah, c'est vous!" said P&lt;hya. "Voulez-vous \nmanger* N'ayez pas peur, on ne vous {era pas \nde mat," J he added shyly and affectionately, \ntouching the boy's hand. "Entrez, entrez." a \n\n"Merci, monsieur'' 3 said the drummer boy \nin a trembling almost childish voice, and he \nbegan scraping his dirty feet on the threshold. \n\nThere were many things Petya wanted to \nsay to the drummer boy, but did not dare to. \nHe stood irresolutely beside him in the pas- \nsage. Then in the darkness he took the boy's \nhand and pressed it. \n\n"Come in, come in!" he repeated in a gentle \nwhisper. "Oh, what can I do for him?" he \nthought, and opening the door he let the boy \npass in first. \n\nWhen the boy had entered the hut, Pdtya \nsat down at a distance from him, considering \nit beneath his dignity to pay attention to him. \nBut he fingered the money in his pocket and \nwondered whether it would seem ridiculous \nto give some to the drummer boy. \n\nCHAPTER VIII \n\nTHE ARRIVAL OF D6LOKHOV diverted P^tya's at- \ntention from the drummer boy, to whom Denf- \nsov had had some mutton and vodka given, \nand whom he had had dressed in a Russian \ncoat so that he might be kept with their band \nand not sent away with the other prisoners. \nPe"tya had heard in the army many stories of \nD61okhov's extraordinary bravery and of his \ncruelty to the French, so from the moment he \nentered the hut Pe*tya did not take his eyes \nfrom him, but braced himself up more and \nmore and held his head high, that he might \nnot be unworthy even of such company. \n\nD61okhov's appearance amazed Ptya by its \nsimplicity. \n\nDenisov wore a Cossack coat, had a beard, \nhad an icon of Nicholas the Wonder- Worker \non his breast, and his way of speaking and \neverything he did indicated his unusual posi- \ntion. But Dolokhov, who in Moscow had worn \na Persian costume, had now the appearance of \na most correct officer of the Guards. He was \n\n1 "Ah, it's you! Do you want something to eat? \nDon't be afraid, they won't hurt you." \n* "Come in, come in." \n8 "Thank you, sir." \n\n\n\nclean-shaven and wore a Guardsman's padded \ncoat with an Order of St. George at his button- \nhole and a plain forage cap set straight on his \nhead. He took off his wet felt cloak in a corner \nof the room, and without greeting anyone went \nup to Denfsov and began questioning him \nabout the matter in hand. Denisov told him of \nthe designs the large detachments had on the \ntransport, of the message Ptya had brought, \nand his own replies to both generals. Then he \ntold him all he knew of the French detach- \nment. \n\n"That's so. But we must know what troops \nthey are and their numbers," said D61okhov. \n"It will be necessary to go there. We can't start \nthe affair without knowing for certain how \nmany of them there are. I like to work accu- \nrately. Here now wouldn't one of these gen- \ntlemen like to ride over to the French camp \nwith me? I have brought a spare uniform." \n\n"I, I ... I'll go with you!" cried Pckya. \n\n"There's no need for you to go at all," said \nDenisov, addressing D61okhov, "and as for \nhim, I won't let him go on any account." \n\n"I like that!" exclaimed P^tya. "Why \nshouldn't I go?" \n\n"Because it's useless." \n\n"Well, you must excuse me, because . . . be- \ncause ... I shall go, and that's all. You'll take \nme, won't you?" he said, turning to Dolokhov. \n\n"Why not?" D61okhov answered absently, \nscrutinizing the face of the French drummer \nboy. "Have you had that youngster with you \nlong?" he asked Denisov. \n\n"He was taken today but he knows nothing. \nI'm keeping him with me." \n\n"Yes, and where do you put the others?" \ninquired Dolokhov. \n\n"Where? I send them away and take a we- \nceipt for them," shouted Denisov, suddenly \nflushing. "And I say boldly that I have not a \nsingle man's life on my conscience. Would it \nbe difficult for you to send thirty or thwee hun- \ndwed men to town under escort, instead of \nstaining I speak bluntly staining the honor \nof a soldier?" \n\n"That kind of amiable talk would be suit- \nable from this young count of sixteen," said \nD61okhov with cold irony, "but it's time for \nyou to drop it." \n\n"Why, I've not said anything! I only say \nthat I'll certainly go with you," said Ptya \nshyly. \n\n"But for you and me, old fellow, it's time to \ndrop these amenities," continued D61okhov, \nas if he found particular pleasure in speaking \n\n\n\nBOOK FOURTEEN \n\nof this subject which irritated Denfsov. "Now, \nwhy have you kept this lad?" he went on, sway- \ning his head. "Because you are sorry for him! \nDon't we know those 'receipts' of yours? You \nsend a hundred men away, and thirty get there. \nThe rest either starve or get killed. So isn't it \nall the same not to send them?" \n\nThe esaul, screwing up his light-colored \neyes, nodded approvingly. \n\n"That's not the point. I'm not going to dis- \ncuss the matter. I do not wish to take it on my \nconscience. You say they'll die. All wight. Only \nnot by my fault!" \n\nD61okhov began laughing. \n\n"Who has told them not to capture me these \ntwenty times over? But if they did catch me \nthey'd string me up to an aspen tree, and you \nwith all your chivalry just the same." He \npaused. "However, we must get to work. Tell \nthe Cossack to fetch my kit. I have two French \nuniforms in it. Well, are you coming with me?" \nhe asked P&lt;kya. \n\n"I? Yes, yes, certainly!" cried Ptya, blush- \ning almost to tears and glancing at Denfsov. \n\nWhile D61okhov had been disputing with \nDenfsov what should be done with prisoners, \nPtftya had once more felt awkward and restless; \nbut again he had no time to grasp fully what \nthey were talking about. "If grown-up, dis- \ntinguished men think so, it must be necessary \nand right," thought he. "But above all Denfsov \nmust not dare to imagine that I'll obey him and \nthat he can order me about. I will certainly go \nto the French camp with D61okhov. If he can, \nso can I!" \n\nAnd to all Denisov's persuasions, Pchya re- \nplied that he too was accustomed to do every- \nthing accurately and not just anyhow, and that \nhe never considered personal danger. \n\n"For you'll admit that if we don't know for \nsure how many of them there are . . . hundreds \nof lives may depend on it, while there are only \ntwo of us. Besides, I want to go very much and \ncertainly will go, so don't hinder me," said he. \n"It will only make things worse. . . ." \n\n\n\n599 \n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX \n\nHAVING PUT ON French greatcoats and shakos, \nPtya and D61okhov rode to the clearing from \nwhich Denfsov had reconnoitered the French \ncamp, and emerging from the forest in pitch \ndarkness they descended into the hollow. On \nreaching the bottom, D61okhov told the Cos- \nsacks accompanying him to await him there \nand rode on at a quick trot along the road to \nthe bridge. P^tya, his heart in his mouth with \n\n\n\nexcitement, rode by his side. \n\n"If we're caught, I won't be taken alive! I \nhave a pistol," whispered he. \n\n"Don't talk Russian," said D61okhov in a \nhurried whisper, and at that very moment they \nheard through the darkness the challenge: "Qui \nviveV 1 and the click of a musket. \n\nThe blood rushed to Pchya's face and he \ngrasped his pistol. \n\n"Landers du 6-me," 2 replied D61okhov, \nneither hastening nor slackening his horse's \npace. \n\nThe black figure of a sentinel stood on the \nbridge. \n\n"M ot d'ordre." * \n\nDolokhov reined in his horse and advanced \nat a walk. \n\n"Dites done, le colonel Gerard eat ici?" * he \nasked. \n\n"Mot d'ordre'' repeated the sentinel, bar- \nring the way and not replying. \n\n"Quand un officier fait sa ronde, les sentinel- \nles ne demandent pas le mot d'ordre . . ." cried \nDolokhov suddenly flaring up and riding \nstraight at the sentinel. "Je vous demande si \nle colonel est ici." 5 \n\nAnd without waiting for an answer from \nthe sentinel, who had stepped aside, D61okhov \nrode up the incline at a walk. \n\nNoticing the black outline of a man crossing \nthe road, D61okhov stopped him and inquired \nwhere the commander and officers were. The \nman, a soldier with a sack over his shoulder, \nstopped, came close up to Dolokhov's horse, \ntouched it with his hand, and explained sim- \nply and in a friendly way that the commander \nand the officers were higher up the hill to the \nright in the courtyard of the farm, as he called \nthe landowner's house. \n\nHaving ridden up the road, on both sides \nof which French talk could be heard around \nthe campfires, D61okhov turned into the court- \nyard of the landowner's house. Having ridden \nin, he dismounted and approached a big blaz- \ning campfire, around which sat several men \ntalking noisily. Something was boiling in a \nsmall cauldron at the edge of the fire and a \nsoldier in a peaked cap and blue overcoat, lit \nup by the fire, was kneeling beside it stirring \nits contents with a ramrod. \n\n"Who goes there?" \n\n"Lancers of the 6th Regiment." \n\n"Password." \n\n"Tell me, is Colonel Gerard here?" \n\n"When an officer is making his round, sentinels \ndon't ask him for the password. ... I am asking \nyou if the colonel is here." \n\n\n\n6oo \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\n"Oh, he's a hard nut to crack," said one of \nthe officers who was sitting in the shadow at \nthe other side of the fire. \n\n"He'll make them get a move on, those fel- \nlows!" said another, laughing. \n\nBoth fell silent, peering out through the \ndarkness at the sound of D61okhov's and \nP^tya's steps as they advanced to the fire lead- \ning their horses. \n\n"Bonjour, messieurs!" J said Dolokhov loud- \nly and clearly. \n\nThere was a stir among the officers in the \nshadow beyond the fire, and one tall, long- \nnecked officer, walking round the fire, came \nup to D61okhov. \n\n"Is that you, Cldment?" he asked. "Where \nthe devil . . . ?" But, noticing his mistake, he \nbroke off short and, with a frown, greeted \nDolokhov as a stranger, asking what he could \ndo for him. \n\nDolokhov said that he and his companion \nwere trying to overtake their regiment, and \naddressing the company in general asked \nwhether they knew anything of the 6th Regi- \nment. None of them knew any thing, and Ptya \nthought the officers were beginning to look at \nhim and D61okhov with hostility and suspi- \ncion. For some seconds all were silent. \n\n"If you were counting on the evening soup, \nyou have come too late," said a voice from be- \nhind the fire with a repressed laugh. \n\nDolokhov replied that they were not hungry \nand must push on farther that night. \n\nHe handed the horses over to the soldier \nwho was stirring the pot and squatted down \non his heels by the fire beside the officer with \nthe long neck. That officer did not take his \neyes from D61okhov and again asked to what \nregiment he belonged. D61okhov, as if he had \nnot heard the question, did not reply, but \nlighting a short French pipe which he took \nfrom his pocket began asking the officer in \nhow far the road before them was safe from \nCossacks. \n\n"Those brigands are everywhere," replied \nan officer from behind the fire. \n\nD61okhov remarked that the Cossacks were \na danger only to stragglers such as his compan- \nion and himself, "but probably they would not \ndare to attack large detachments?" he added \ninquiringly. No one replied. \n\n"Well, now he'll come away," P^tya thought \nevery moment as he stood by the campfire lis- \ntening to the talk. \n\nBut D61okhov restarted the conversation \n\n*"Good day, gentlemen!" \n\n\n\nwhich had dropped and began putting direct \nquestions as to how many men there were in \nthe battalion, how many battalions, and how \nmany prisoners. Asking about the Russian \nprisoners with that detachment, D61okhov \nsaid: \n\n"A horrid business dragging these corpses \nabout with one! It would be better to shoot \nsuch rabble," and burst into loud laughter, so \nstrange that Ptya thought the French would \nimmediately detect their disguise, and invol- \nuntarily took a step back from the campfire. \n\nNo one replied a word to D61okhov's laugh- \nter, and a French officer whom they could not \nsee (he lay wrapped in a greatcoat) rose and \nwhispered something to a companion. D61ok- \nhov got up and called to the soldier who was \nholding their horses. \n\n"Will they bringour horses or not?" thought \nP^tya, instinctively drawing nearer to D61ok- \nhov. \n\nThe horses were brought. \n\n"Good evening, gentlemen," said D61okhov. \n\nPdtya wished to say "Good night" but could \nnot utter a word. The officers were whispering \ntogether. D61okhov was a long time mounting \nhis horse which would not stand still, then he \nrode out of the yard at a footpace. Ptya rode \nbeside him, longing to look round to see \nwhether or no the French were running after \nthem, but not daring to. \n\nComing out onto the road D61okhov did \nnot ride back across the open country, but \nthrough the village. At one spot he stopped \nand listened. "Do you hear?" he asked. Ptya \nrecognized the sound of Russian voices and \nsaw the dark figures of Russian prisoners round \ntheir campfires. When they had descended to \nthe bridge Ptya and D61okhov rode past the \nsentinel, who without saying a word paced mo- \nrosely up and down it, then they descended \ninto the hollow where the Cossacks awaited \nthem. \n\n"Well now, good-by. Tell Denfsov, 'at the \nfirst shot at daybreak,' " said D61okhov and \nwas about to ride away, but Pchya seized hold \nof him. \n\n"Really!" he cried, "you are such a hero! \nOh, how fine, how splendid! How I love \nyou!" \n\n"All right, all right!" said D61okhov. But \nPtya did not let go of him and D61okhov saw \nthrough the gloom that Ptya was bending to- \nward him and wanted to kiss him. D61okhov \nkissed him, laughed, turned his horse, and van- \nished into the darkness. \n\n\n\nBOOK FOURTEEN \n\n\n\n601 \n\n\n\nCHAPTER X \n\nHAVING RETURNED to the watchman's hut, \nPtya found Denisov in the passage. He was \nawaiting Pehya's return in a state of agitation, \nanxiety, and self-reproach for having let him \n\ngo- \n\n"Thank God!" he exclaimed. "Yes, thank \nGod!" he repeated, listening to Pe*tya's raptur- \nous account. "But, devil take you, I haven't \nslept because of you! Well, thank God. Now \nlie down. We can still get a nap before morn- \ning." \n\n"But . . . no," said Ptya, "I don't want to \nsleep yet. Besides I know myself, if I fall asleep \nit's finished. And then I am used to not sleep- \ning before a battle." \n\nHe sat awhile in the hut joyfully recalling \nthe details of his expedition and vividly pic- \nturing to himself what would happen next \nday. \n\nThen, noticing that Denisov was asleep, he \nrose and went out of doors. \n\nIt was still quite dark outside. The rain was \nover, but drops were still falling from the trees. \nNear the watchman's hut the black shapes of \nthe Cossacks' shanties and of horses tethered to- \ngether could be seen. Behind the hut the dark \nshapes of the two wagons with their horses be- \nside them were discernible, and in the hollow \nthe dying campfire gleamed red. Not all the \nCossacks and hussars were asleep; here and \nthere, amid the sounds of falling drops and \nthe munching of the horses near by, could be \nheard low voices which seemed to be whisper- \ning. \n\nPtya came out, peered into the darkness, \nand went up to the wagons. Someone was snor- \ning under them, and around them stood sad- \ndled horses munching their oats. In the dark \nPtya recognized his own horse, which he called \n"Karabdkh" * though it was of Ukranian breed, \nand went up to it. \n\n"Well, Karabdkh! We'll do some service to- \nmorrow," said he, sniffing its nostrils and kiss- \ning it. \n\n"Why aren't you asleep, sir?" said a Cossack \nwho was sitting under a wagon. \n\n"No, ah . . . Likhachev isn't that your name? \nDo you know I have only just come back! \nWe've been into the French camp." \n\nAnd Pdtya gave the Cossack a detailed ac- \ncount not only of his ride but also of his object, \nand why he considered it better to risk his life \nthan to act "just anyhow." \n\n1 Karabakh is a district in the sou them Caucasus, \nfamous for its breed of horses. TR. \n\n\n\n"Well, you should get some sleep now," said \nthe Cossack. \n\n"No, I am used to this," said Ptya. "I say, \naren't the flints in your pistols worn out? I \nbrought some with me. Don't you want any? \nYou can have some." \n\nThe Cossack bent forward from under the \nwagon to get a closer look at Pdtya. \n\n"Because I am accustomed to doing every- \nthing accurately," said Ptya. "Some fellows \ndo things just anyhow, without preparation, \nand then they're sorry for it afterwards. I don't \nlike that." \n\n"Just so," said the Cossack. \n\n"Oh yes, another thing! Please, my dear \nfellow, will you sharpen my saber for me? It's \ngot bl . . ." (Pckya feared to tell a lie, and the \nsaber never had been sharpened.) "Can you do \nit?" \n\n"Of course I can." \n\nLikhachev got up, rummaged in his pack, \nand soon Pdtya heard the warlike sound of \nsteel on whetstone. He climbed onto the wagon \nand sat on its edge. The Cossack was sharpen- \ning the saber under the wagon. \n\n"I say! Are the lads asleep?" asked Ptya. \n\n"Some are, and some aren'tlike us." \n\n"Well, and that boy?" \n\n"Vese*nny? Oh, he's thrown himself down \nthere in the passage. Fast asleep after his \nfright. He was that glad!" \n\nAfter that Ptya remained silent for a long \ntime, listening to the sounds. He heard foot- \nsteps in the darkness and a black figure ap- \npeared. \n\n"What are you sharpening?" asked a man \ncoming up to the wagon. \n\n"Why, this gentleman's saber." \n\n"That's right," said the man, whom Ptya \ntook to be an hussar. "Was the cup left here?" \n\n"There, by the wheel!" \n\nThe hussar took the cup. \n\n"It must be daylight soon," said he, yawn- \ning, and went away. \n\nPtya ought to have known that he was in \na forest with Denfsov's guerrilla band, less \nthan a mile from the road, sitting on a wagon \ncaptured from the French beside which horses \nwere tethered, that under it Likhachev was sit- \nting sharpening a saber for him, that the big \ndark blotch to the right was the watchman's \nhut, and the red blotch below to the left was \nthe dying embers of a campfire, that the man \nwho had come for the cup was an hussar who \nwanted a drink; but he neither knew nor \nwanted to know anything of all this. He was \n\n\n\n602 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nin a fairy kingdom where nothing resembled \nreality. The big dark blotch might really be \nthe watchman's hut or it might be a cavern \nleading to the very depths of the earth. Per- \nhaps the red spot was a fire, or it might be the \neye of an enormous monster. Perhaps he was \nreally sitting on a wagon, but it might very \nwell be that he was not sitting on a wagon \nbut on a terribly high tower from which, if \nhe fell, he would have to fall for a whole day \nor a whole month, or go on falling and never \nreach the bottom. Perhaps it was just the Cos- \nsack, Likhachev, who was sitting under the \nwagon, but it might be the kindest, bravest, \nmost wonderful, most splendid man in the \nworld, whom no one knew of. It might really \nhave been that an hussar came for water and \nwent back into the hollow, but perhaps he had \nsimply vanisheddisappeared altogether and \ndissolved into nothingness. \n\nNothing Ptya could have seen now would \nhave surprised him. He was in a fairy kingdom \nwhere everything was possible. \n\nHe looked up at the sky. And the sky was a \nfairy realm like the earth. It was clearing, and \nover the tops of the trees clouds were swiftly \nsailing as if unveiling the stars. Sometimes it \nlooked as if the clouds were passing, and a \nclear black sky appeared. Sometimes it seemed \nas if the black spaces were clouds. Sometimes \nthe sky seemed to be rising high, high over- \nhead, and then it seemed to sink so low that \none could touch it with one's hand. \n\nP^tya's eyes began to close and he swayed a \nlittle. \n\nThe trees were dripping. Quiet talking was \nheard. The horses neighed and jostled one \nanother. Someone snored. \n\n"Ozheg-zheg, Ozheg-zheg . . ." hissed the \nsaber against the whetstone, and suddenly \nPtya heard an harmonious orchestra playing \nsome unknown, sweetly solemn hymn. Ptya \nwas as musical as Natdsha and more so than \nNicholas, but had never learned music or \nthought about it, and so the melody that un- \nexpectedly came to his mind seemed to him \nparticularly fresh and attractive. The music \nbecame more and more audible. The melody \ngrew and passed from one instrument to an- \nother. And what was played was a fugue \nthough Ptya had not the least conception of \nwhat a fugue is. Each instrument now re- \nsembling a violin and now a horn, but better \nand clearer than violin or horn played its \nown part, and before it had finished the mel- \nody merged with another instrument that be- \n\n\n\ngan almost the same air, and then with a third \nand a fourth; and they all blended into one \nand again became separate and again blended, \nnow into solemn church music, now into some- \nthing dazzlingly brilliant and triumphant. \n\n"Oh why, that was in a dream!" Ptya said \nto himself, as he lurched forward. "It's in my \nears. But perhaps it's music of my own. Well, \ngo on, my music! Now! . . ." \n\nHe closed his eyes, and, from all sides as if \nfrom a distance, sounds fluttered, grew into \nharmonies, separated, blended, and again all \nmingled into the same sweet and solemn \nhymn. "Oh, this is delightful! As much as I \nlike and as I like!" said Ptya to himself. He \ntried to conduct that enormous orchestra. \n\n"Now softly, softly die away!" and the \nsounds obeyed him. "Now fuller, more joyful. \nStill more and more joyful!" And from an un- \nknown depth rose increasingly triumphant \nsounds. "Now voices join in!" ordered Ptya. \nAnd at first from afar he heard men's voices \nand then women's. The voices grew in har- \nmonious triumphant strength, and P^tya lis- \ntened to their surpassing beauty in awe and \njoy. \n\nWith a solemn triumphal march there min- \ngled a song, the drip from the trees, and the \nhissing of the saber, "Ozheg-zheg-zheg . . ." \nand again the horses jostled one another and \nneighed, not disturbing the choir but joining \nin it. \n\nPtya did not know how long this lasted: he \nenjoyed himself all the time, wondered at his \nenjoyment and regretted that there was no \none to share it. He was awakened by Lik- \nhache'v's kindly voice. \n\n"It's ready, your honor; you can split a \nFrenchman in half with it!" \n\nPtya woke up. \n\n"It's getting light, it's really getting light!" \nhe exclaimed. \n\nThe horses that had previously been in- \nvisible could now be seen to their very tails, \nand a watery light showed itself through the \nbare branches. Ptya shook himself, jumped \nup, took a ruble from his pocket and gave it \nto Likhachev; then he flourished the saber, \ntested it, and sheathed it. The Cossacks were \nuntying their horses and tightening their sad- \ndle girths. \n\n"And here's the commander," said Likha- \nche*v. \n\nDenisov came out of the watchman's hut \nand, having called P^tya, gave orders to get \nready. \n\n\n\nBOOK FOURTEEN \n\n\n\n603 \n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI \n\nTHE MEN rapidly picked out their horses in \nthe semidarkness, tightened their saddle girths, \nand formed companies. Denisov stood by the \nwatchman's hut giving final orders. The in- \nfantry of the detachment passed along the \nroad and quickly disappeared amid the trees \nin the mist of early dawn, hundreds of feet \nsplashing through the mud. The esaul gave \nsome orders to his men. Pe"tya held his horse \nby the bridle, impatiently awaiting the order \nto mount. His face, having been bathed in \ncold water, was all aglow, and his eyes were \nparticularly brilliant. Cold shivers ran down \nhis spine and his whole body pulsed rhythmi- \ncally. \n\n"Well, is ev'wything weady?" asked Denisov. \n"Bwing the horses." \n\nThe horses were brought. Denisov was \nangry with the Cossack because the saddle \ngirths were too slack, reproved him, and \nmounted. Ptya put his foot in the stirrup. His \nhorse by habit made as if to nip his leg, but \nPtya leaped quickly into the saddle uncon- \nscious of his own weight and, turning to look \nat the hussars starting in the darkness behind \nhim, rode up to Denisov. \n\n"Vasili Dmitrich, entrust me with some com- \nmission! Please . . . for God's sake ... 1" said \nhe. \n\nDenisov seemed to have forgotten Pe"tya's \nvery existence. He turned to glance at him. \n\n"I ask one thing of you," he said sternly, "to \nobey me and not shove you'self fo'ward any- \nwhere." \n\nHe did not say another word to P^tya but \nrode in silence all the way. When they had \ncome to the edge of the forest it was noticeably \ngrowing light over the field. Denisov talked in \nwhispers with the esaul and the Cossacks rode \npast P&lt;kya and Denisov. When they had all \nridden by, Denisov touched his horse and rode \ndown the hill. Slipping onto their haunches \nand sliding, the horses descended with their \nriders into the ravine. Ptya rode beside Denf- \nsov, the pulsation of his body constantly in- \ncreasing. It was getting lighter and lighter, \nbut the mist still hid distant objects. Having \nreached the valley, Denisov looked back and \nnodded to a Cossack beside him. \n\n"The signall" said he. \n\nThe Cossack raised his arm and a shot rang \nout. In an instant the tramp of horses gallop- \ning forward was heard, shouts came from vari- \nous sides, and then more shots. \n\nAt the first sound of trampling hoofs and \n\n\n\nshouting, Ptya lashed his horse and loosening \nhis rein galloped forward, not heeding Denisov \nwho shouted at him. It seemed to Ptya that at \nthe moment the shot was fired it suddenly be- \ncame as bright as noon. He galloped to the \nbridge. Cossacks were galloping along the road \nin front of him. On the bridge he collided with \na Cossack who had fallen behind, but he gal- \nloped on. In front of him soldiers, probably \nFrenchmen, were running from right to left \nacross the road. One of them fell in the mud \nunder his horse's feet. \n\nCossacks were crowding about a hut, busy \nwith something. From the midst of that crowd \nterrible screams arose. Pchya galloped up, and \nthe first thing he saw was the pale face and \ntrembling jaw of a Frenchman, clutching the \nhandle of a lance that had been aimed at him. \n\n"Hurrah! . . . Lads! . . . ours!" shouted Ptya, \nand giving rein to his excited horse he gal- \nloped forward along the village street. \n\nHe could hear shooting ahead of him. Cos- \nsacks, hussars, and ragged Russian prisoners, \nwho had come running from both sides of the \nroad, were shouting something loudly and in- \ncoherently. A gallant-looking Frenchman, in \na blue overcoat, capless, and with a frowning \nred face, had been defending himself against \nthe hussars. When Ptya galloped up the \nFrenchman had already fallen. "Too late \nagain!" flashed through Pdtya's mind and he \ngalloped on to the place from which the rapid \nfiring could be heard. The shots came from \nthe yard of the landowner's house he had \nvisited the night before with Dolokhov. The \nFrench were making a stand there behind a \nwattle fence in a garden thickly overgrown \nwith bushes and were firing at the Cossacks \nwho crowded at the gateway. Through the \nsmoke, as he approached the gate, Pchya saw \nDolokhov, whose face was of a pale-greenish \ntint, shouting to his men. "Go round! Wait \nfor the infantry!" he exclaimed as Pe*tya rode \nup to him. \n\n"Wait? . . . Hurrah-ah-ah!" shouted Ptya, \nand without pausing a moment galloped to \nthe place whence came the sounds of firing \nand where the smoke was thickest. \n\nA volley was heard, and some bullets whistled \npast, while others plashed against something. \nThe Cossacks and D61okhov galloped after \nPtya into the gateway of the courtyard. In the \ndense wavering smoke some of the French \nthrew down their arms and ran out of the \nbushes to meet the Cossacks, while others ran \ndown the hill toward the pond. Ptya was \n\n\n\n604 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\ngalloping along the courtyard, but instead of \nholding the reins he waved both his arms \nabout rapidly and strangely, slipping farther \nand farther to one side in his saddle. His \nhorse, having galloped up to a campfire that \nwas smoldering in the morning light, stopped \nsuddenly, and Ptya fell heavily on to the \nwet ground. The Cossacks saw that his arms \nand legs jerked rapidly though his head was \nquite motionless. A bullet had pierced his \nskull. \n\nAfter speaking to the senior French officer, \nwho came out of the house with a white \nhandkerchief tied to his sword and announced \nthat they surrendered, D61okhov dismounted \nand went up to Ptya, who lay motionless with \noutstretched arms. \n\n"Done for!" he said with a frown, and went \nto the gate to meet Denfsov who was riding \ntoward him. \n\n"Killed?" cried Denisov, recognizing from \na distance the unmistakably lifeless attitude- \nvery familiar to him in which P^tya's body \nwas lying. \n\n"Done forl" repeated Dolokhov as if the \nutterance of these words afforded him pleas- \nure, and he went quickly up to the prisoners, \nwho were surrounded by Cossacks who had \nhurried up. "We won't take them!" he called \nout to Denisov. \n\nDenisov did not reply; he rode up to Ptya, \ndismounted, and with trembling hands turned \ntoward himself the bloodstained, mud-bespat- \ntered face which had already gone white. \n\n"I am used to something sweet. Raisins, \nfine ones . . . take them all!" he recalled Pdtya's \nwords. And the Cossacks looked round in sur- \nprise at the sound, like the yelp of a dog, with \nwhich Denfsov turned away, walked to the \nwattle fence, and seized hold of it. \n\nAmong the Russian prisoners rescued by \nDenfsov and Dolokhov was Pierre Bezukhov. \n\nCHAPTER XII \n\nDURING THE WHOLE of their march from Mos- \ncow no fresh orders had been issued by the \nFrench authorities concerning the party of \nprisoners among whom was Pierre. On the \ntwenty-second of October that party was no \nlonger with the same troops and baggage trains \nwith which it had left Moscow. Half the \nwagons laden with hardtack that had traveled \nthe first stages with them had been captured \nby Cossacks, the other half had gone on ahead. \nNot one of those dismounted cavalrymen who \nhad marched in front of the prisoners was \n\n\n\nleft; they had all disappeared. The artillery \nthe prisoners had seen in front of them during \nthe first days was now replaced by Marshal \nJunot's enormous baggage train, convoyed by \nWestphalians, Behind the prisoners came a \ncavalry baggage train. \n\nFrom Vyazma onwards the French army, \nwhich had till then moved in three columns, \nwent on as a single group. The symptoms of \ndisorder that Pierre had noticed at their first \nhalting place after leaving Moscow had now \nreached the utmost limit. \n\nThe road along which they moved was \nbordered on both sides by dead horses; ragged \nmen who had fallen behind from various regi- \nments continually changed about, now join- \ning the moving column, now again lagging \nbehind it. \n\nSeveral times during the march false alarms \nhad been given and the soldiers of the escort \nhad raised their muskets, fired, and run head- \nlong, crushing one another, but had after- \nwards reassembled and abused each other for \ntheir causeless panic. \n\nThese three groups traveling together the \ncavalry stores, the convoy of prisoners, and \nJunot's baggage train still constituted a sep- \narate and united whole, though each of the \ngroups was rapidly melting away. \n\nOf the artillery baggage train which had \nconsisted of a hundred and twenty wagons, \nnot more than sixty now remained; the rest \nhad been captured or left behind. Some of \nJunot's wagons also had been captured or \nabandoned. Three wagons had been raided \nand robbed by stragglers from Davout's corps. \nFrom the talk of the Germans Pierre learned \nthat a larger guard had been allotted to that \nbaggage train than to the prisoners, and that \none of their comrades, a German soldier, had \nbeen shot by the marshal's own order because \na silver spoon belonging to the marshal had \nbeen found in his possession. \n\nThe group of prisoners had melted away \nmost of all. Of the three hundred and thirty \nmen who had set out from Moscow fewer than \na hundred now remained. The prisoners were \nmore burdensome to the escort than even the \ncavalry saddles or Junot's baggage. They under- \nstood that the saddles and Junot's spoon might \nbe of some use, but that cold and hungry \nsoldiers should have to stand and guard equally \ncold and hungry Russians who froze and \nlagged behind on the road (in which case the \norder was to shoot them) was not merely in- \ncomprehensible but revolting. And the escort, \n\n\n\nBOOK FOURTEEN \n\n\n\n605 \n\n\n\nas if afraid, in the grievous condition they \nthemselves were in, of giving way to the pity \nthey felt for the prisoners and so rendering \ntheir own plight still worse, treated them with \nparticular moroseness and severity. \n\nAt Dorogobuzh while the soldiers of the \nconvoy, after locking the prisoners in a stable, \nhad gone off to pillage their own stores, several \nof the soldier prisoners tunneled under the \nwall and ran away, but were recaptured by \nthe French and shot. \n\nThe arrangement adopted when they start- \ned, that the officer prisoners should be kept \nseparate from the rest, had long since been \nabandoned. All who could walk went together, \nand after the third stage Pierre had rejoined \nKaratdev and the gray-blue bandy-legged dog \nthat had chosen Karataev for its master. \n\nOn the third day after leaving Moscow \nKaratdev again fell ill with the fever he had \nsuffered from in the hospital in Moscow, and as \nhe grew gradually weaker Pierre kept away \nfrom him. Pierre did not know why, but since \nKarataev had begun to grow weaker it had \ncost him an effort to go near him. When he \ndid so and heard the subdued moaning with \nwhich Karataev generally lay down at the \nhalting places, and when he smelled the odor \nemanating from him which was now stronger \nthan before, Pierre moved farther away and \ndid not think about him. \n\nWhile imprisoned in the shed Pierre had \nlearned not with his intellect but with his \nwhole being, by life itself, that man is created \nfor happiness, that happiness is within him, in \nthe satisfaction of simple human needs, and \nthat all unhappiness arises not from privation \nbut from superfluity. And now during these \nlast three weeks of the march he had learned \nstill another new, consolatory truththat noth- \ning in this world is terrible. He had learned \nthat as there is no condition in which man \ncan be happy and entirely free, so there is no \ncondition in which he need be unhappy and \nlack freedom. He learned that suffering and \nfreedom have their limits and that those limits \nare very near together; that the person in a \nbed of roses with one crumpled petal suffered \nas keenly as he now, sleeping on the bare damp \nearth with one side growing chilled while the \nother was warming; and that when he had put \non tight dancing shoes he had suffered just as \nhe did now when he walked with bare feet \nthat were covered with sores his footgear hav- \ning long since fallen to pieces. He discovered \nthat when he had married his wife of his own \n\n\n\nfree will as it had seemed to himhe had been \nno more free than now when they locked him \nup at night in a stable. Of all that he himself \nsubsequently termed his sufferings, but which \nat the time he scarcely felt, the worst was the \nstate of his bare, raw, and scab-covered feet. \n(The horseflesh was appetizing and nourish- \ning, the saltpeter flavor of the gunpowder they \nused instead of salt was even pleasant; there \nwas no great cold, it was always warm walking \nin the daytime, and at night there were the \ncampfires; the lice that devoured him warmed \nhis body.) The one thing that was at first hard \nto bear was his feet. \n\nAfter the second day's march Pierre, having \nexamined his feet by the campfire, thought it \nwould be impossible to walk on them; but \nwhen everybody got up he went along, limp- \ning, and, when he had warmed up, walked \nwithout feeling the pain, though at night his \nfeet were more terrible to look at than before. \nHowever, he did not look at them now, but \nthought of other things. \n\nOnly now did Pierre realize the full strength \nof life in man and the saving power he has \nof transferring his attention from one thing \nto another, which is like the safety valve \nof a boiler that allows superfluous steam to \nblow off when the pressure exceeds a certain \nlimit. \n\nHe did not see and did not hear how they \nshot the prisoners who lagged behind, though \nmore than a hundred perished in that way. He \ndid not think of Karataev who grew weaker \nevery day and evidently would soon have to \nshare that fate. Still less did Pierre think about \nhimself. The harder his position became and \nthe more terrible the future, the more inde- \npendent of that position in which he found \nhimself were the joyful and comforting \nthoughts, memories, and imaginings that came \nto him. \n\nCHAPTER XIII \n\nAT MIDDAY on the twenty-second of October \nPierre was going uphill along the muddy, slip- \npery road, looking at his feet and at the rough- \nness of the way. Occasionally he glanced at the \nfamiliar crowd around him and then again at \nhis feet. The former and the latter were alike \nfamiliar and his own. The blue-gray bandy- \nlegged dog ran merrily along the side of the \nroad, sometimes in proof of its agility and self- \nsatisfaction lifting one hind leg and hopping \nalong on three, and then again going on all \nfour and rushing to bark at the crows that sat \n\n\n\n6o6 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\non the carrion. The dog was merrier and sleek- \ner than it had been in Moscow. All around lay \nthe flesh of different animals from men to \nhorses in various stages of decomposition; \nand as the wolves were kept off by the passing \nmen the dog could eat all it wanted. \n\nIt had been raining since morning and had \nseemed as if at any moment it might cease and \nthe sky clear, but after a short break it began \nraining harder than before. The saturated road \nno longer absorbed the water, which ran along \nthe ruts in streams. \n\nPierre walked along, looking from side to \nside, counting his steps in threes, and reckon- \ning them off on his fingers. Mentally address- \ning the rain, he repeated: "Now then, now \nthen, go on! Pelt harder!" \n\nIt seemed to him that he was thinking of \nnothing, but far down and deep within him \nhis soul was occupied with something impor- \ntant and comforting. This something was a \nmost subtle spiritual deduction from a con- \nversation with Karataev the day before. \n\nAt their yesterday's halting place, feeling \nchilly by a dying campfire, Pierre had got up \nand gone to the next one, which was burning \nbetter. There Platon Karataev was sitting cov- \nered up head and all with his greatcoat as if \nit were a vestment, telling the soldiers in his \neffective and pleasant though now feeble voice \na story Pierre knew. It was already past mid- \nnight, the hour when Karataev was usually free \nof his fever and particularly lively. When \nPierre reached the fire and heard Platon 's \nvoice enfeebled by illness, and saw his pathetic \nface brightly lit up by the blaze, he felt a pain- \nful prick at his heart. His feeling of pity for \nthis man frightened him and he wished to go \naway, but there was no other fire, and Pierre \nsat down, trying not to look at Plat6n. \n\n"Well, how are you?" he asked. \n\n"How am I? If we grumble at sickness, God \nwon't grant us death," replied Plat6n, and at \nonce resumed the story he had begun. \n\n"And so, brother," he continued, with a \nsmile on his pale emaciated face and a particu- \nlarly happy light in his eyes, " you see, broth- \ner . . ." \n\nPierre had long been familiar with that \nstory. Karataev had told it to him alone some \nhalf-dozen times and always with a specially \njoyful emotion. But well as he knew it, Pierre \nnow listened to that tale as to something new, \nand the quiet rapture Karataev evidently felt \nas he told it communicated itself also to Pierre. \nThe story was of an old merchant who lived a \n\n\n\ngood and God-fearing life with his family, and \nwho went once to the Nizhni fair with a com- \npaniona rich merchant. \n\nHaving put up at an inn they both went to \nsleep, and next morning his companion was \nfound robbed and with his throat cut. A blood- \nstained knife was found under the old mer- \nchant's pillow. He was tried, knouted, and his \nnostrils having been torn off, "all in due \nform" as Karataev put it, he was sent to hard \nlabor in Siberia. \n\n"And so, brother" (it was at this point that \nPierre came up), "ten years or more passed by. \nThe old man was living as a convict, submit- \nting as he should and doing no wrong. Only \nhe prayed to God for death. Well, one night \nthe convicts were gathered just as we are, with \nthe old man among them. And they began tell- \ning what each was suffering for, and how they \nhad sinned against God. One told how he had \ntaken a life, another had taken two, a third \nhad set a house on fire, while another had \nsimply been a vagrant and had done nothing. \nSo they asked the old man: 'What are you be- \ning punished for, Daddy?' 'I, my dear broth- \ners,' said he, 'am being punished for my own \nand other men's sins. But I have not killed \nanyone or taken anything that was not mine, \nbut have only helped my poorer brothers. I \nwas a merchant, my dear brothers, and had \nmuch property.' And he went on to tell them \nall about it in due order. 'I don't grieve for \nmyself,' he says, 'God, it seems, has chastened \nme. Only I am sorry for rny old wife and the \nchildren,' and the old man began to weep. \nNow it happened that in the group was the \nvery man who had killed the other merchant. \n'Where did it happen, Daddy?' he said. 'When, \nand in what month?' He asked all about it and \nhis heart began to ache. So he comes up to the \nold man like this, and falls down at his feet! \n'You are perishing because of me, Daddy,' he \nsays. 'It's quite true, lads, that this man,' he \nsays, 'is being tortured innocently and for \nnothing! I,' he says, 'did that deed, and I put \nthe knife under your head while you were \nasleep. Forgive me, Daddy,' he says, 'for Christ's \nsake!' " \n\nKarataev paused, smiling joyously as he \ngazed into the fire, and he drew the logs to- \ngether. \n\n"And the old man said, 'God will forgive \nyou, we are all sinners in His sight. I suffer \nfor my own sins,' and he wept bitter tears. \nWell, and what do you think, dear friends?" \nKaratdev continued, his face brightening more \n\n\n\nBOOK FOURTEEN \n\n\n\n607 \n\n\n\nand more with a rapturous smile as if what he \nnow had to tell contained the chief charm and \nthe whole meaning of his story: "What do you \nthink, dear fellows? That murderer confessed \nto the authorities. 'I have taken six lives/ he \nsays (he was a great sinner), 'but what I am \nmost sorry for is this old man. Don't let him \nsuffer because of me.' So he confessed and it \nwas all written down and the papers sent off in \ndue form. The place was a long way off, and \nwhile they were judging, what with one thing \nand another, filling in the papers all in due \nformthe authorities I meantime passed. \nThe affair reached the Tsar. After a while the \nTsar's decree came: to set the merchant free \nand give him a compensation that had been \nawarded. The paper arrived and they began \nto look for the old man. 'Where is the old man \nwho has been suffering innocently and in \nvain? A paper has come from the Tsar!' so \nthey began looking for him/' here Karatdev's \nlower jaw trembled, "but God had already \nforgiven him he was dead! That's how it was, \ndear fellows!" Karataev concluded and sat for \na long time silent, gazing before him with a \nsmile. \n\nAnd Pierre's soul was dimly but joyfully \nfilled not by the story itself but by its mysteri- \nous significance: by the rapturous joy that lit \nup Karataev's face as he told it, and the mystic \nsignificance of that joy. \n\nCHAPTER XIV \n\n"A vos places!'' * suddenly cried a voice. \n\nA pleasant feeling of excitement and an ex- \npectation of something joyful and solemn was \naroused among the soldiers of the convoy and \nthe prisoners. From all sides came shouts of \ncommand, and from the left came smartly \ndressed cavalrymen on good horses, passing \nthe prisoners at a trot. The expression on all \nfaces showed the tension people feel at the \napproach of those in authority. The prisoners \nthronged together and were pushed off the \nroad. The convoy formed up. \n\n"The Emperor! The Emperor! The Mar- \nshall The Dukel" and hardly had the sleek \ncavalry passed, before a carriage drawn by \nsix gray horses rattled by. Pierre caught a \nglimpse of a man in a three-cornered hat with \na tranquil look on his handsome, plump, white \nface. It was one of the marshals. His eye fell on \nPierre's large and striking figure, and in the \nexpression with which he frowned and looked \n\nl "To your places!" \n\n\n\naway Pierre thought he detected sympathy and \na desire to conceal that sympathy. \n\nThe general in charge of the stores galloped \nafter the carriage with a red and frightened \nface, whipping up his skinny horse. Several \nofficers formed a group and some soldiers \ncrowded round them. Their faces all looked \nexcited and worried. \n\n"What did he say? What did he say?" Pierre \nheard them ask. \n\nWhile the marshal was passing, the prison- \ners had huddled together in a crowd, and \nPierre saw Karatdev whom he had not yet seen \nthat morning. He sat in his short overcoat \nleaning against a birch tree. On his face, be- \nsides the look of joyful emotion it had worn \nyesterday while telling the tale of the merchant \nwho suffered innocently, there was now an ex- \npression of quiet solemnity. \n\nKarataev looked at Pierre with his kindly \nround eyes now filled with tears, evidently \nwishing him to come near that he might say \nsomething to him. But Pierre was not suffi- \nciently sure of himself. He made as if he did not \nnotice that look and moved hastily away. \n\nWhen the prisoners again went forward \nPierre looked round. Karatdev was still sitting \nat the side of the road under the birch tree and \ntwo Frenchmen were talking over his head. \nPierre did not look round again but went \nlimping up the hill. \n\nFrom behind, where Karatdev had been sit- \nting, came the sound of a shot. Pierre heard \nit plainly, but at that moment he remembered \nthat he had not yet finished reckoning up how \nmany stages still remained to Smolensk a cal- \nculation he had begun before the marshal \nwent by. And he again started reckoning. Two \nFrench soldiers ran past Pierre, one of whom \ncarried a lowered and smoking gun. They \nboth looked pale, and in the expression on \ntheir faces one of them glanced timidly at \nPierre there was something resembling what \nhe had seen on the face of the young soldier \nat the execution. Pierre looked at the soldier \nand remembered that, two days before, that \nman had burned his shirt while drying it at \nthe fire and how they had laughed at him. \n\nBehind him, where Karataev had been sit- \nting, the dog began to howl. "What a stupid \nbeast! Why is it howling?" thought Pierre. \n\nHis comrades, the prisoner soldiers walking \nbeside him, avoided looking back at the place \nwhere the shot had been fired and the dog was \nhowling, just as Pierre did, but there w-is a \nset look on all their faces. \n\n\n\n6o8 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV \n\n\n\nTHE STORES, the prisoners, and the marshal's \nbaggage train stopped at the village of Sham- \nshevo. The men crowded together round the \ncampfires. Pierre went up to the fire, ate some \nroast horseflesh, lay down with his back to the \nfire, and immediately fell asleep. He again \nslept as he had done at Mozhdysk after the \nbattle of Borodin6. \n\nAgain real events mingled with dreams and \nagain someone, he or another, gave expression \nto his thoughts, and even to the same thoughts \nthat had been expressed in his dream at \nMozhdysk. \n\n"Life is everything. Life is God. Everything \nchanges and moves and that movement is God. \nAnd while there is life there is joy in con- \nsciousness of the divine. To love life is to love \nGod. Harder and more blessed than all else \nis to love this life in one's sufferings, in in- \nnocent sufferings." \n\n"Karatdevl" came to Pierre's mind. \n\nAnd suddenly he saw vividly before him a \nlong-forgotten, kindly old man who had given \nhim geography lessons in Switzerland. "Wait \na bit," said the old man, and showed Pierre a \nglobe. This globe was alivea vibrating ball \nwithout fixed dimensions. Its whole surface \nconsisted of drops closely pressed together, and \nall these drops moved and changed places, \nsometimes several of them merging into one, \nsometimes one dividing into many. Each drop \ntried to spread out and occupy as much space \nas possible, but others striving to do the same \ncompressed it, sometimes destroyed it, and \nsometimes merged with it. \n\n"That is life," said the old teacher. \n\n"How simple and clear it is," thought Pierre. \n"How is it I did not know it before?" \n\n"God is in the midst, and each drop tries to \nexpand so as to reflect Him to the greatest \nextent. And it grows, merges, disappears from \nthe surface, sinks to the depths, and again \nemerges. There now, Karataev has spread out \nand disappeared. Do you understand, my \nchild?" said the teacher. \n\n"Do you understand, damn you?" shouted \na voice, and Pierre woke up. \n\nHe lifted himself and sat up. A Frenchman \nwho had just pushed a Russian soldier away \nwas squatting by the fire, engaged in roasting \na piece of meat stuck on a ramrod. His sleeves \nwere rolled up and his sinewy, hairy, red hands \nwith their short fingers deftly turned the ram- \nrod. His brown morose face with frowning \n\n\n\nbrows was clearly visible by the glow of the \ncharcoal. \n\n"It's all the same to him," he muttered, turn- \ning quickly to a soldier who stood behind him. \n"Brigand! Get away!" \n\nAnd twisting the ramrod he looked gloom- \nily at Pierre, who turned away and gazed into \nthe darkness. A prisoner, the Russian soldier \nthe Frenchman had pushed away, was sitting \nnear the fire patting something with his hand. \nLooking more closely Pierre recognized the \nblue-gray dog, sitting beside the soldier, wag- \nging its tail. \n\n"Ah, he's come?" said Pierre. "And Plat" he \nbegan, but did not finish. \n\nSuddenly and simultaneously a crowd of \nmemories awoke in his fancy of the look Pla- \nt6n had given him as he sat under the tree, of \nthe shot heard from that spot, of the dog's \nhowl, of the guilty faces of the two Frenchmen \nas they ran past him, of the lowered and smok- \ning gun, and of Karatdev's absence at this halt \nand he was on the point of realizing that \nKarataev had been killed, but just at that in- \nstant, he knew not why, the recollection came \nto his mind of a summer evening he had spent \nwith a beautiful Polish lady on the veranda of \nhis house in Kiev. And without linking up \nthe events of the day or drawing a conclusion \nfrom them, Pierre closed his eyes, seeing a \nvision of the country in summertime mingled \nwith memories of bathing and of the liquid, \nvibrating globe, and he sank into water so \nthat it closed over his head. \n\nBefore sunrise he was awakened by shouts \nand loud and rapid firing. French soldiers were \nrunning past him. \n\n"The Cossacks!" one of them shouted, and \na moment later a crowd of Russians surround- \ned Pierre. \n\nFor a long time he could not understand \nwhat was happening to him. All around he \nheard his comrades sobbing with joy. \n\n"Brothers! Dear fellows! Darlings!" old \nsoldiers exclaimed, weeping, as they embraced \nCossacks and hussars. \n\nThe hussars and Cossacks crowded round \nthe prisoners; one offered them clothes, an- \nother boots, and a third bread. Pierre sobbed \nas he sat among them and could not utter a \nword. He hugged the first soldier who ap- \nproached him, and kissed him, weeping. \n\nD61okhov stood at the gate of the ruined \nhouse, letting a crowd of disarmed Frenchmen \npass by. The French, excited by all that had \nhappened, were talking loudly among them- \n\n\n\nBOOK FOURTEEN \n\n\n\n609 \n\n\n\nselves, but as they passed D61okhov who gently \nswitched his boots with his whip and watched \nthem with cold glassy eyes that boded no good, \nthey became silent. On the opposite side stood \nD61okhov's Cossack, counting the prisoners \nand marking off each hundred with a chalk \nline on the gate. \n\n"How many?" D61okhov asked the Cossack. \n\n"The second hundred," replied the Cos- \nsack. \n\n"Filez, filez!" * D61okhov kept saying, having \nadopted this expression from the French, and \nwhen his eyes met those of the prisoners they \nflashed with a cruel light. \n\nDenisov, bareheaded and with a gloomy \nface, walked behind some Cossacks who were \ncarrying the body of Ptya Rost6v to a hole \nthat had been dug in the garden. \n\nCHAPTER XVI \n\nAFTER THE TWENTY-EIGHTH OF OCTOBER when \nthe frosts began, the flight of the French as- \nsumed a still more tragic character, with men \nfreezing, or roasting themselves to death at the \ncampfires, while carriages with people dressed \nin furs continued to drive past, carrying away \nthe property that had been stolen by the Em- \nperor, kings, and dukes; but the process of the \nflight and disintegration of the French army \nwent on essentially as before. \n\nFrom Moscow to Vyizma the French army \nof seventy-three thousand men not reckoning \nthe Guards (who did nothing during the \nwhole war but pillage) was reduced to thirty- \nsix thousand, though not more than five thou- \nsand had fallen in battle. From this beginning \nthe succeeding terms of the progression could \nbe determined mathematically. The French \narmy melted away and perished at the same \nrate from Moscow to Vyazma, from Vyazma to \nSmolensk, from Smolensk to the Berezina, and \nfrom the Berezina to Vilna independently of \nthe greater or lesser intensity of the cold, the \npursuit, the barring of the way, or any other \nparticular conditions. Beyond Vyazma the \nFrench army instead of moving in three col- \numns huddled together into one mass, and so \nwent on to the end. Berthier wrote to his Em- \nperor (we know how far commanding officers \nallow themselves to diverge from the truth in \ndescribing the condition of an army) and this \nis what he said: \n\nI deem it my duty to report to Your Majesty the \ncondition of the various corps I have had occasion \n\n1 "Get along, get along!" \n\n\n\nto observe during different stages of the last two \nor three days' march. They are almost disbanded. \nScarcely a quarter of the soldiers remain with the \nstandards of their regiments, the others go off by \nthemselves in different directions hoping to find \nfood and escape discipline. In general they regard \nSmolensk as the place where they hope to recover. \nDuring the last few days many of the men have \nbeen seen to throw away their cartridges and their \narms. In such a state of affairs, whatever your ulti- \nmate plans may be, the interest of Your Majesty's \nservice demands that the army should be rallied at \nSmolensk and should first of all be freed from in- \neffectives, such as dismounted cavalry, unnecessary \nbaggage, and artillery material that is no longer \nin proportion to the present forces. The soldiers, \nwho are worn out with hunger and fatigue, need \nsupplies as well as a few days' rest. Many have died \nthese last days on the road or at the bivouacs. This \nstate of things is continually becoming worse and \nmakes one fear that unless a prompt remedy is \napplied the troops will no longer be under control \nin case of an engagement. \nNovember 9: twenty miles from Smolensk. \n\nAfter staggering into Smolensk which \nseemed to them a promised land, the French, \nsearching for food, killed one another, sacked \ntheir own stores, and when everything had \nbeen plundered fled farther. \n\nThey all went without knowing whither or \nwhy they were going. Still less did that genius, \nNapoleon, know it, for no one issued any \norders to him. But still he and those about \nhim retained their old habits: wrote com- \nmands, letters, reports, and orders of the day; \ncalled one another sire, mon cousin, prince \nd'Eckrniihl, roi de Naples, and so on. But these \norders and reports were only on paper, noth- \ning in them was acted upon for they could not \nbe carried out, and though they entitled one \nanother Majesties, Highnesses, or Cousins, \nthey all felt that they were miserable wretches \nwho had done much evil for which they had \nnow to pay. And though they pretended to be \nconcerned about the army, each was thinking \nonly of himself and of how to get away quickly \nand save himself. \n\nCHAPTER XVII \n\nTHE MOVEMENTS of the Russian and French \narmies during the campaign from Moscow \nback to the Niemen were like those in a game \nof Russian blindman's bluff, in which two \nplayers are blindfolded and one of them oc- \ncasionally rings a little bell to inform the \ncatcher of his whereabouts. First he rings his \nbell fearlessly, but when he gets into a tight \n\n\n\n6io \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nplace he runs away as quietly as he can, and \noften thinking to escape runs straight into his \nopponent's arms. \n\nAt first while they were still moving along \nthe Kaluga road, Napoleon's armies made \ntheir presence known, but later when they \nreached the Smolensk road they ran holding \nthe clapper of their bell tight and of ten think- \ning they were escaping ran right into the Rus- \nsians. \n\nOwing to the rapidity of the French flight \nand the Russian pursuit and the consequent \nexhaustion of the horses, the chief means of \napproximately ascertaining the enemy's posi- \ntionby cavalry scoutingwas not available. \nBesides, as a result of the frequent and rapid \nchange of position by each army, even what \ninformation was obtained could not be de- \nlivered in time. If news was received one day \nthat the enemy had been in a certain position \nthe day before, by the third day when some- \nthing could have been done, that army was \nalready two days' march farther on and in \nquite another position. \n\nOne army fled and the other pursued. Be- \nyond Smolensk there were several different \nroads available for the French, and one would \nhave thought that during their stay of four \ndays they might have learned where the enemy \nwas, might have arranged some more advan- \ntageous plan and undertaken something new. \nBut after a four days' halt the mob, with no \nmaneuvers or plans, again began running \nalong the beaten track, neither to the right \nnor to the left but along the old the worst- \nroad, through Krasnoe and Orsha. \n\nExpecting the enemy from behind and not \nin front, the French separated in their flight \nand spread out over a distance of twenty-four \nhours. In front of them all fled the Emperor, \nthen the kings, then the dukes. The Russian \narmy, expecting Napoleon to take the road to \nthe right beyond the Dnieper which was the \nonly reasonable thing for him to do them- \nselves turned to the right and came out onto \nthe highroad at Krasnoe. And here as in a \ngame of blindman's buff the French ran into \nour vanguard. Seeing their enemy unexpect- \nedly the French fell into confusion and stopped \nshort from the sudden fright, but then they \nresumed their flight, abandoning their com- \nrades who were farther behind. Then for three \ndays separate portions of the French army-- \nfirst Murat's (the vice-king's), then Davout's, \nand then Ney's ran, as it were, the gauntlet of \nthe Russian army. They abandoned one an- \n\n\n\nother, abandoned all their heavy baggage, \ntheir artillery, and half their men, and fled, \ngetting past the Russians by night by making \nsemicircles to the right. \n\nNey, who came last, had been busying him- \nself blowing up the walls of Smolensk which \nwere in nobody's way, because despite the un- \nfortunate plight of the French or because of \nit, they wished to punish the floor against \nwhich they had hurt themselves. Ney, who had \nhad a corps of ten thousand men, reached \nNapoleon at Orsha* with only one thousand \nmen left, having abandoned all the rest and \nall his cannon, and having crossed the Dnieper \nat night by stealth at a wooded spot. \n\nFrom Orshd they fled farther along the \nroad to Vilna, still playing at blindman's buff \nwith the pursuing army. At the Berezina \nthey again became disorganized, many were \ndrowned and many surrendered, but those \nwho got across the river fled farther. Their \nsupreme chief donned a fur coat and, having \nseated himself in a sleigh, galloped on alone, \nabandoning his companions. The others who \ncould do so drove away too, leaving those who \ncould not to surrender or die. \n\nCHAPTER XVIII \n\nTHIS CAMPAIGN consisted in a flight of the \nFrench during which they did all they could \nto destroy themselves. From the time they \nturned onto the Kaluga road to the day their \nleader fled from the army, none of the move- \nments of the crowd had any sense. So one \nmight have thought that regarding this period \nof the campaign the historians, who attributed \nthe actions of the mass to the will of one man, \nwould have found it impossible to make the \nstory of the retreat fit their theory. But no! \nMountains of books have been written by the \nhistorians about this campaign, and every- \nwhere are described Napoleon's arrangements, \nthe maneuvers, and his profound plans which \nguided the army, as well as the military genius \nshown by his marshals. \n\nThe retreat from Malo-Yaroslavets when he \nhad a free road into a well-supplied district \nand the parallel road was open to him along \nwhich Kutiizov afterwards pursued him this \nunnecessary retreat along a devastated road- \nis explained to us as being due to profound \nconsiderations. Similarly profound considera- \ntions are given for his retreat from Smolensk \nto Orsha. Then his heroism at Krasnoe is de- \nscribed, where he is reported to have been \nprepared to accept battle and take personal \n\n\n\nBOOK FOURTEEN \n\n\n\n611 \n\n\n\ncommand, and to have walked about with a \nbirch stick and said: \n\n"J'ai assez fait I'empereur; il est temps de \nfaire le general" * but nevertheless immedi- \nately ran away again, abandoning to its fate \nthe scattered fragments of the army he left \nbehind. \n\nThen we are told of the greatness of soul \nof the marshals, especially of Ney a greatness \nof soul consisting in this: that he made his way \nby night around through the forest and across \nthe Dnieper and escaped to Orsha, abandon- \ning standards, artillery, and nine tenths of his \nmen. \n\nAnd lastly, the final departure of the great \nEmperor from his heroic army is presented to \nus by the historians as something great and \ncharacteristic of genius. Even that final run- \nning away, described in ordinary language as \nthe lowest depth of baseness which every child \nis taught to be ashamed of even that act finds \njustification in the historians' language. \n\nWhen it is impossible to stretch the very \nelastic threads of historical ratiocination any \nfarther, when actions are clearly contrary to \nall that humanity calls right or even just, the \nhistorians produce a saving conception of \n"greatness." "Greatness," it seems, excludes the \nstandards of right and wrong. For the "great" \nman nothing is wrong, there is no atrocity for \nwhich a "great" man can be blamed. \n\n"C'est grand!" 2 say the historians, and \nthere no longer exists either good or evil but \nonly "grand" and "not grand." Grand is good, \nnot grand is bad. Grand is the characteristic, in \ntheir conception, of some special animals \ncalled "heroes. "And Napoleon, escaping home \nin a warm fur coat and leaving to perish those \nwho were not merely his comrades but were \n(in his opinion) men he had brought there, \nfeels que c'est grand, 9 and his soul is tran- \nquil. \n\n"Du sublime (he saw something sublime in \nhimseff) au ridicule il n'y a qu'un pas" * said \nhe. And the whole world for fifty years has \nbeen repeating: "Sublime! Grand! Napoleon \nle Grand!" Du sublime au ridicule il n'y a \nqu'un pas. \n\nAnd it occurs to no one that to admit a \ngreatness not commensurable with the stand- \nard of right and wrong is merely to admit \n\n1 "I have acted the Emperor long enough; it is \ntime to act the general." \n\n"It is great!" \n\n8 That it is great. \n\n4 "From the sublime to the ridiculous is but a \nstep." \n\n\n\none's own nothingness and immeasurable \nmeanness. \n\nFor us with the standard of good and evil \ngiven us by Christ, no human actions are in- \ncommensurable. And there is no greatness \nwhere simplicity, goodness, and truth are ab- \nsent. \n\nCHAPTER XIX \n\nWHAT RUSSIAN, reading the account of the last \npart of the campaign of 1812, has not experi- \nenced an uncomfortable feeling of regret, dis- \nsatisfaction, and perplexity? Who has not \nasked himself how it is that the French were \nnot all captured or destroyed when our three \narmies surrounded them in superior numbers, \nwhen the disordered French, hungry and \nfreezing, surrendered in crowds, and when (as \nthe historians relate) the aim of the Russians \nwas to stop the French, to cut them off, and \ncapture them all? \n\nHow was it that the Russian army, which \nwhen numerically weaker than the French had \ngiven battle at Borodin6, did not achieve its \npurpose when it had surrounded the French \non three sides and when its aim was to cap- \nture them? Can the French be so enormously \nsuperior to us that when we had surrounded \nthem with superior forces we could not beat \nthem? How could that happen? \n\nHistory (or what is called by that name) re- \nplying to these questions says that this oc- \ncurred because Kutuzov and Tormdsov and \nChichag6v, and this man and that man, did \nnot execute such and such maneuvers. . . . \n\nBut why did they not execute those maneu- \nvers? And why if they were guilty of not carry- \ning out a prearranged plan were they not tried \nand punished? But even if we admitted that \nKutuzov, Chichag6v, and others were the cause \nof the Russian failures, it is still incomprehen- \nsible why, the position of the Russian army \nbeing what it was at Kr&amp;moe and at the Bere- \nzina (in both cases we had superior forces), \nthe French army with its marshals, kings, and \nEmperor was not captured, if that was what \nthe Russians aimed at. \n\nThe explanation of this strange fact given \nby Russian military historians (to the effect \nthat Kutiizov hindered an attack) is unfound- \ned, for we know that he could not restrain the \ntroops from attacking at Vyazma and Taru- \ntino. \n\nWhy was the Russian army which with in- \nferior forces had withstood the enemy in full \nstrength at Borodin6 defeated at Krdsnoeand \n\n\n\n612 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nthe Berezina by the disorganized crowds of the \nFrench when it was numerically superior? \n\nIf the aim of the Russians consisted in cut- \nting off and capturing Napoleon and his mar- \nshalsand that aim was not merely frustrated \nbut all attempts to attain it were most shame- \nfully baffledthen this last period of the cam- \npaign is quite rightly considered by the French \nto be a series of victories, and quite wrongly \nconsidered victorious by Russian historians. \n\nThe Russian military historians in so far \nas they submit to claims of logic must admit \nthat conclusion, and in spite of their lyrical \nrhapsodies about valor, devotion, and so forth, \nmust reluctantly admit that the French retreat \nfrom Moscow was a series of victories for Na- \npoleon and defeats for Kutuzov. \n\nBut putting national vanity entirely aside \none feels that such a conclusion involves a con- \ntradiction, since the series of French victories \nbrought the French complete destruction, while \nthe series of Russian defeats led to the total \ndestruction of their enemy and the liberation \nof their country. \n\nThe source of this contradiction lies in the \nfact that the historians studying the events \nfrom the letters of the sovereigns and the gen- \nerals, from memoirs, reports, projects, and so \nforth, have attributed to this last period of the \nwar of 1812 an aim that never existed, namely \nthat of cutting off and capturing Napoleon \nwith his marshals and his army. \n\nThere never was or could have been such \nan aim, for it would have been senseless and \nits attainment quite impossible. \n\nIt would have been senseless, first because \nNapoleon's disorganized army was flying from \nRussia with all possible speed, that is to say, \nwas doing just what every Russian desired. So \nwhat was the use of performing various opera- \ntions on the French who were running away \nas fast as they possibly could? \n\nSecondly, it would have been senseless to \nblock the passage of men whose whole energy \nwas directed to flight. \n\nThirdly, it would have been senseless to \nsacrifice one's own troops in order to destroy \nthe French army, which without external in- \nterference was destroying itself at such a rate \nthat, though its path was not blocked, it could \nnot carry across the frontier more than it \nactually did in December, namely a hundredth \npart of the original army. \n\nFourthly, it would have been senseless to \nwish to take captive the Emperor, kings, and \ndukes whose capture would have been in- the \n\n\n\nhighest degree embarrassing for the Russians, \nas the most adroit diplomatists of the time \n(Joseph de Maistre and others) recognized. \nStill more senseless would have been the wish \nto capture army corps of the French, when our \nown army had melted away to half before \nreaching Krdsnoe and a whole division would \nhave been needed to convoy the corps of \nprisoners, and when our men were not always \ngetting full rations and the prisoners already \ntaken were perishing of hunger. \n\nAll the profound plans about cutting off \nand capturing Napoleon and his army were \nlike the plan of a market gardener who, when \ndriving out of his garden a cow that had \ntrampled down the beds he had planted, \nshould run to the gate and hit the cow on the \nhead. The only thing to be said in excuse of \nthat gardener would be that he was very \nangry. But not even that could be said for \nthose who drew up this project, for it was not \nthey who had suffered from the trampled beds. \n\nBut besides the fact that cutting off Na- \npoleon with his army would have been sense- \nless, it was impossible. \n\nIt was impossible first because as experi- \nence shows that a three-mile movement of \ncolumns on a battlefield never coincides with \nthe plans the probability of Chichag6v, Kut- \nuzov, and Wittgenstein effecting a junction on \ntime at an appointed place was so remote as \nto be tantamount to impossibility, as in fact \nthought Kutuzov, who when he received the \nplan remarked that diversions planned over \ngreat distances do not yield the desired re- \nsults. \n\nSecondly it was impossible, because to para- \nlyze the momentum with which Napoleon's \narmy was retiring, incomparably greater forces \nthan the Russians possessed would have been \nrequired. \n\nThirdly it was impossible, because the mili- \ntary term "to cut off" has no meaning. One \ncan cut off a slice of bread, but not an army. \nTo cut off an army to bar its road is quite \nimpossible, for there is always plenty of room \nto avoid capture and there is the night when \nnothing can be seen, as the military scientists \nmight convince themselves by the example of \nKrdsnoe and of the Berezina. It is only pos- \nsible to capture prisoners if they agree to be \ncaptured, just as it is only possible to catch a \nswallow if it settles on one's hand. Men can \nonly be taken prisoners if they surrender ac- \ncording to the rules of strategy and tactics, as \nthe Germans did. But the French troops quite \n\n\n\nBOOK FOURTEEN \n\nrightly did not consider that this suited them, \nsince death by hunger and cold awaited them \nin flight or captivity alike. \n\nFourthly and chiefly it was impossible, be- \ncause never since the world began has a war \nbeen fought under such conditions as those \nthat obtained in 1812, and the Russian army \nin its pursuit of the French strained its strength \nto the utmost and could not have done more \nwithout destroying itself. \n\nDuring the movement of the Russian army \nfrom Tarutino to Krasnoe it lost fifty thou- \nsand sick or stragglers, that is a number equal \nto the population of a large provincial town. \nHalf the men fell out of the army without a \nbattle. \n\nAnd it is of this period of the campaign- \nwhen the army lacked boots and sheepskin \ncoats, was short of provisions and without \nvodka, and was camping out at night for \nmonths in the snow with fifteen degrees of \nfrost, 1 when there were only seven or eight \nhours of daylight and the rest was night in \nwhich the influence of discipline cannot be \nmaintained, when men were taken into that \nregion of death where discipline fails, not for \na few hours only as in a battle, but for months, \nwhere they were every moment fighting death \nfrom hunger and cold, when half the army \nperished in a single monthit is of this period \nof the campaign that the historians tell us how \nMilorddovich should have made a flank march \nto such and such a place, Tormasov to another \nplace, and Chichag6v should have crossed \n(more than knee-deep in snow) to somewhere \nelse, and how so-and-so "routed" and "cut off" \nthe French and so on and so on. \n\nThe Russians, half of whom died, did all \nthat could and should have been done to at- \ntain an end worthy of the nation, and they are \ntwo degrees below zero Fahrenheit. \n\n\n\n6.3 \n\n\n\n1 Reaumur \n\n-TR. \n\n\n\nnot to blame because other Russians, sitting \nin warm rooms, proposed that they should do \nwhat was impossible. \n\nAll that strange contradiction now difficult \nto understand between the facts and the his- \ntorical accounts only arises because the his- \ntorians dealing with the matter have written \nthe history of the beautiful words and senti- \nments of various generals, and not the history \nof the events. \n\nTo them the words of Milordovich seem \nvery interesting, and so do their surmises and \nthe rewards this or that general received; but \nthe question of those fifty thousand men who \nwere left in hospitals and in graves does not \neven interest them, for it does not come with- \nin the range of their investigation. \n\nYet one need only discard the study of the \nreports and general plans and consider the \nmovement of those hundreds of thousands of \nmen who took a direct part in the events, and \nall the questions that seemed insoluble easily \nand simply receive an immediate and certain \nsolution. \n\nThe aim of cutting off Napoleon and his \narmy never existed except in the imaginations \nof a dozen people. It could not exist because \nit was senseless and unattainable. \n\nThe people had a single aim: to free their \nland from invasion. That aim was attained in \nthe first place of itself, as the French ran away, \nand so it was only necessary not to stop their \nflight. Secondly it was attained by the guerrilla \nwarfare which was destroying the French, and \nthirdly by the fact that a large Russian army \nwas following the French, ready to use its \nstrength in case their movement stopped. \n\nThe Russian army had to act like a whip \nto a running animal. And the experienced \ndriver knew it was better to hold the whip \nraised as a menace than to strike the running \nanimal on the head. \n\n\n\nBook Fifteen: 1812-13 \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I \n\nWHEN SEEING a dying animal a man feels a \nsense of horror: substance similar to his own is \nperishing before his eyes. But when it is a be- \nloved and intimate human being that is dying, \nbesides this horror at the extinction of life \nthere is a severance, a spiritual wound, which \nlike a physical wound is sometimes fatal and \nsometimes heals, but always aches and shrinks \nat any external irritating touch. \n\nAfter Prince Andrew's death Natdsha and \nPrincess Mary alike felt this. Drooping in spirit \nand closing their eyes before the menacing \ncloud of death that overhung them, they dared \nnot look life in the face. They carefully guard- \ned their open wounds from any rough and \npainful contact. Everything: a carriage pass- \ning rapidly in the street, a summons to dinner, \nthe maid's inquiry what dress to prepare, or \nworse still any word of insincere or feeble \nsympathy, seemed an insult, painfully irritated \nthe wound, interrupting that necessary quiet \nin which they both tried to listen to the stern \nand dreadful choir that still resounded in their \nimagination, and hindered their gazing into \nthose mysterious limitless vistas that for an in- \nstant had opened out before them. \n\nOnly when alone together were they free \nfrom such outrage and pain. They spoke little \neven to one another, and when they did it was \nof very unimportant matters. \n\nBoth avoided any allusion to the future. \nTo admit the possibility of a future seemed to \nthem to insult his memory. Still more carefully \ndid they avoid anything relating to him who \nwas dead. It seemed to them that what they \nhad lived through and experienced could not \nbe expressed in words, and that any reference \nto the details of his life infringed the majesty \nand sacredness of the mystery that had been \naccomplished before their eyes. \n\nContinued abstention from speech, and con- \nstant avoidance of everything that might lead \nup to the subject this halting on all sides at \nthe boundary of what they might not mention \n\n\n\nbrought before their minds with still greater \npurity and clearness what they were both feel- \ning. \n\nBut pure and complete sorrow is as impos- \nsible as pure and complete joy. Princess Mary, \nin her position as absolute and independent \narbiter of her own fate and guardian and in- \nstructor of her nephew, was the first to be \ncalled back to life from that realm of sorrow \nin which she had dwelt for the first fortnight. \nShe received letters from her relations to which \nshe had to reply; the room in which little \nNicholas had been put was damp and he be- \ngan to cough; Alpatych came to Yaroslavl with \nreports on the state of their affairs and with \nadvice and suggestions that they should return \nto Moscow to the house on the Vozdvfzhenka \nStreet, which had remained uninjured and \nneeded only slight repairs. Life did not stand \nstill and it was necessary to live. Hard as it was \nfor Princess Mary to emerge from the realm \nof secluded contemplation in which she had \nlived till then, and sorry and almost ashamed \nas she felt to leave Natasha alone, yet the cares \nof life demanded her attention and she in- \nvoluntarily yielded to them. She went through \nthe accounts with Alpatych, conferred with \nDessalles about her nephew, and gave orders \nand made preparations for the journey to \nMoscow. \n\nNatasha remained alone and, from the time \nPrincess Mary began making preparations for \ndeparture, held aloof from her too. \n\nPrincess Mary asked the countess to let \nNatasha go with her to Moscow, and both par- \nents gladly accepted this offer, for they saw \ntheir daughter losing strength every day and \nthought that a change of scene and the advice \nof Moscow doctors would be good for her. \n\n"I am not going anywhere," Natasha replied \nwhen this was proposed to her. "Do please just \nleave me alonel" And she ran out of the room, \nwith difficulty refraining from tears of vexa- \ntion and irritation rather than of sorrow. \n\nAfter she felt herself deserted by Princess \n\n\n\n614 \n\n\n\nBOOK FIFTEEN \n\n\n\n615 \n\n\n\nMary and alone in her grief, Natasha spent \nmost of the time in her room by herself, sitting \nhuddled up feet and all in the corner of the \nsofa, tearing and twisting something with her \nslender nervous fingers and gazing intently and \nfixedly at whatever her eyes chanced to fall on. \nThis solitude exhausted and tormented her \nbut she was in absolute need of it. As soon as \nanyone entered she got up quickly, changed \nher position and expression, and picked up a \nbook or some sewing, evidently waiting im- \npatiently for the intruder to go. \n\nShe felt all the time as if she might at any \nmoment penetrate that on whichwith a ter- \nrible questioning too great for her strength \nher spiritual gaze was fixed. \n\nOne day toward the end of December Natd- \nsha, pale and thin, dressed in a black woolen \ngown, her plaited hair negligently twisted into \na knot, was crouched feet and all in the corner \nof her sofa, nervously crumpling and smooth- \ning out the end of her sash while she looked \nat a corner of the door. \n\nShe was gazing in the direction in which he \nhad gone to the other side of life. And that \nother side of life, of which she had never be- \nfore thought and which had formerly seemed \nto her so far away and improbable, was now \nnearer and more akin and more comprehen- \nsible than this side of life, where everything \nwas either emptiness and desolation or suffer- \ning and indignity. \n\nShe was gazing where she knew him to be; \nbut she could not imagine him otherwise than \nas he had been here. She now saw him again as \nhe had been at Mytishchi, at Tr6itsa, and at \nYarosldvl. \n\nShe saw his face, heard his voice, repeated \nhis words and her own, and sometimes devised \nother words they might have spoken. \n\nThere he is lying back in an armchair in his \nvelvet cloak, leaning his head on his thin pale \nhand. His chest is dreadfully hollow and his \nshoulders raised. His lips are firmly closed, his \neyes glitter, and a wrinkle comes and goes on \nhis pale forehead. One of his legs twitches just \nperceptibly, but rapidly. Natasha knows that \nhe is struggling with terrible pain. "What is \nthat pain like? Why does he have that pain? \nWhat does he feel? How does it hurt him?" \nthought Natasha. He noticed her watching \nhim, raised his eyes, and began to speak seri- \nously: \n\n"One thing would be terrible," said he: "to \nbind oneself forever to a suffering man. It \nwould be continual torture." And he looked \n\n\n\nsearchingly at her. Natdsha as usual answered \nbefore she had time to think what she would \nsay. She said: "This can't go on it won't. You \nwill get well quite well." \n\nShe now saw him from the commencement \nof that scene and relived what she had then \nfelt. She recalled his long sad and severe look \nat those words and understood the meaning of \nthe rebuke and despair in that protracted gaze. \n\n"I agreed," Natasha now said to herself, \n"that it would be dreadful if he always con- \ntinued to suffer. I said it then only because it \nwould have been dreadful for him, but he \nunderstood it differently. He thought it would \nbe dreadful for me. He then still wished to \nlive and feared death. And I said it so awk- \nwardly and stupidly! I did not say what I \nmeant. I thought quite differently. Had I said \nwhat I thought, I should have said: even if he \nhad to go on dying, to die continually before \nmy eyes, I should have been happy compared \nwith what I am now. Now there is nothing . . . \nnobody. Did he know that? No, he did not \nand never will know it. And now it will never, \nnever be possible to put it right." And now \nhe again seemed to be saying the same words \nto her, only in her imagination Natdsha this \ntime gave him a different answer. She stopped \nhim and said: "Terrible lor you, but not for \nme! You know that for me there is nothing in \nlife but you, and to suffer with you is the great- \nest happiness for me," and he took her hand \nand pressed it as he had pressed it that terrible \nevening four days before his death. And in \nher imagination she said other tender and lov- \ning words whidi she might have said then but \nonly spoke now: "I love theel . . . thee! I love, \nlove . . ." she said, convulsively pressing her \nhands and setting her teeth with a desperate \neffort. . . . \n\nShe was overcome by sweet sorrow and tears \nwere already rising in her eyes; then she sud- \ndenly asked herself to whom she was saying \nthis. Again everything was shrouded in hard, \ndry perplexity, and again with a strained frown \nshe peered toward the world where he was. \nAnd now, now it seemed to her she was pene- \ntrating the mystery. . . . But at the instant \nwhen it seemed that the incomprehensible was \nrevealing itself to her a loud rattle of the door \nhandle struck painfully on her ears. Dunydsha, \nher maid, entered the room quickly and \nabruptly with a frightened look on her face \nand showing no concern for her mistress. \n\n"Come to your Papa at once, please!" s?id \nshe with a strange, excited look. "A misfor- \n\n\n\n6i6 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\ntune . . . about Peter Ilynich ... a letter/' she \nfinished with a sob. \n\nCHAPTER II \n\nBESIDES A FEELING of aloofness from everybody \nNatdsha was feeling a special estrangement \nfrom the members of her own family. All of \nthem her father, mother, and S6nya were so \nnear to her, so familiar, so commonplace, that \nall their words and feelings seemed an insult \nto the world in which she had been living of \nlate, and she felt not merely indifferent to them \nbut regarded them with hostility. She heard \nDunydsha's words about Peter Ilynich and a \nmisfortune, but did not grasp them. \n\n"What misfortune? What misfortune can \nhappen to them? They just live their own old, \nquiet, and commonplace life," thought Natd- \nsha. \n\nAs she entered the ballroom her father was \nhurriedly coming out of her mother's room. \nHis face was puckered up and wet with tears. \nHe had evidently run out of that room to give \nvent to the sobs that were choking him. When \nhe saw Natdsha he waved his arms despairingly \nand burst into convulsively painful sobs that \ndistorted his soft round face. \n\n"Pe . . . P^tya . . . Go, go, she ... is call- \ning . . ." and weeping like a child and quickly \nshuffling on his feeble legs to a chair, he almost \nfell into it, covering his face with his hands. \n\nSuddenly an electric shock seemed to run \nthrough Natdsha's whole being. Terrible an- \nguish struck her heart, she felt a dreadful ache \nas if something was being torn inside her and \nshe were dying. But the pain was immediately \nfollowed by a feeling of release from the op- \npressive constraint that had prevented her \ntaking part in life. The sight of her father, the \nterribly wild cries of her mother that she heard \nthrough the door, made her immediately for- \nget herself and her own grief. \n\nShe ran to her father, but he feebly waved \nhis arm, pointing to her mother's door. Prin- \ncess Mary, pal&amp;and with quivering chin, came \nout from that room and taking Natdsha by the \narm said something to her. Natdsha neither \nsaw nor heard her. She went in with rapid steps, \npausing at the door for an instant as if strug- \ngling with herself, and then ran to her mother. \n\nThe countess was lying in an armchair in a \nstrange and awkward position, stretching out \nand beating her head against the wall. S6nya \nand the maids were holding her arms. \n\n"Natasha! Natdsha! . . ." cried the countess. \n"It's not true . . . it's not true . . , He's ly- \n\n\n\ning . . . Natdsha!" she shrieked, pushing those \naround her away. "Go away, all of you; it's not \ntrue! Killed! ... ha, ha, ha! ... It's not true!" \n\nNatdsha put one knee on the armchair, \nstooped over her mother, embraced her, and \nwith unexpected strength raised her, turned \nher face toward herself, and clung to her. \n\n"Mummy! . . . darling! ... I am here, my \ndearest Mummy," she kept on whispering, not \npausing an instant. \n\nShe did not let go of her mother but strug- \ngled tenderly with her, demanded a pillow and \nhot water, and unfastened and tore open her \nmother's dress. \n\n"My dearest darling . . . Mummy, my pre- \ncious! . . ." she whispered incessantly, kissing \nher head, her hands, her face, and feeling her \nown irrepressible and streaming tears tickling \nher nose and cheeks. \n\nThe countess pressed her daughter's hand, \nclosed her eyes, and became quiet for a mo- \nment. Suddenly she sat up with unaccustomed \nswiftness, glanced vacantly around her, and \nseeing Natdsha began to press her daughter's \nhead with all her strength. Then she turned \ntoward her daughter's face which was wincing \nwith pain and gazed long at it. \n\n"Natdsha, you love me?" she said in a soft \ntrustful whisper. "Natdsha, you would not de- \nceive me? You'll tell me the whole truth?" \n\nNatdsha looked at her with eyes full of tears \nand in her look there was nothing but love and \nan entreaty for forgiveness. \n\n"My darling Mummy 1" she repeated, strain- \ning all the power of her love to find some way \nof taking on herself the excess of grief that \ncrushed her mother. \n\nAnd again in a futile struggle with reality \nher mother, refusing to believe that she could \nlive when her beloved boy was killed in the \nbloom of life, escaped from reality into a \nworld of delirium. \n\nNatdsha did not remember how that day \npassed nor that night, nor the next day and \nnight. She did not sleep and did not leave her \nmother. Her persevering and patient love \nseemed completely to surround the countess \nevery moment, not explaining or consoling, \nbut recalling her to life. \n\nDuring the third night the countess kept \nvery quiet for a few minutes, and Natdsha \nrested her head on the arm of her chair and \nclosed her eyes, but opened them again on \nhearing the bedstead creak. The countess was \nsitting up in bed and speaking softly. \n\n"How glad I am you have come. You are \n\n\n\nBOOK FIFTEEN \n\ntired. Won't you have some tea?" Natasha \nwent up to her. "You have improved in looks \nand grown more manly/' continued the count- \ness, taking her daughter's hand. \n\n"Mammal What are you saying? . . ." \n"Natdsha, he is no more, no more!" \nAnd embracing her daughter, the countess \nbegan to weep for the first time. \n\n\n\n617 \n\n\n\nCHAPTER III \n\nPRINCESS MARY postponed her departure. S6nya \nand the count tried to replace Natdsha but \ncould not. They saw that she alone was able to \nrestrain her mother from unreasoning despair. \nFor three weeks Natdsha remained constantly \nat her mother's side, sleepingon a lounge chair \nin her room, making her eat and drink, and \ntalking to her incessantly because the mere \nsound of her tender, caressing tones soothed \nher mother. \n\nThe mother's wounded spirit could not heal. \nPetya's death had torn from her half her life. \nWhen the news of Pdtya's death had come she \nhad been a fresh and vigorous woman of fifty, \nbut a month later she left her room a listless \nold woman taking no interest in life. But the \nsame blow that almost killed the countess, this \nsecond blow, restored Natasha to life. \n\nA spiritual wound produced by a rending of \nthe spiritual body is like a physical wound \nand, strange as it. may seem, just as a deep \nwound may heal and its edges join, physical \nand spiritual wounds alike can yet heal com- \npletely only as the result of a vital force from \nwithin. \n\nNatasha's wound healed in that way. She \nthought her life was ended, but her love for her \nmother unexpectedly showed her that the es- \nsence of life love was still active within her. \nLove awoke and so did life. \n\nPrince Andrew's last days had bound Prin- \ncess Mary and Natasha together; this new sor- \nrow brought them still closer to one another. \nPrincess Mary put off her departure, and for \nthree weeks looked after Natdsha as if she had \nbeen a sick child. The last weeks passed in her \nmother's bedroom had strained Natdsha's phys- \nical strength. \n\nOne afternoon noticing Natasha shivering \nwith fever, Princess Mary took her to her own \nroom and made her lie down on the bed. Nata- \nsha lay down, but when Princess Mary had \ndrawn the blinds and was going away she called \nher back. \n\n"I don't want to sleep, Mary, sit by me a \nlittle." \n\n\n\n"You are tiredtry to sleep." \n\n"No, no. Why did you bring me away? She \nwill be asking for me." \n\n"She is much better. She spoke so well to- \nday," said Princess Mary. \n\nNatdsha lay on the bed and in the semidark- \nness of the room scanned Princess Mary's face. \n\n"Is she like him?" thought Natdsha. "Yes, \nlike and yet not like. But she is quite original, \nstrange, new, and unknown. And she loves me. \nWhat is in her heart? All that is good. But \nhow? What is her mind like? What does she \nthink about me? Yes, she is splendid!" \n\n"Mary," she said timidly, drawing Princess \nMary's hand to herself, "Mary, you mustn't \nthink me wicked. No? Mary darling, how I love \nyou! Let us be quite, quite friends." \n\nAnd Natdsha, embracing her, began kissing \nher face and hands, making Princess Mary feel \nshy but happy by this demonstration of her \nfeelings. \n\nFrom that day a tender and passionate friend- \nship such as exists only between women was \nestablished between Princess Mary and Nata- \nsha. They were continually kissing and saying \ntender things to one another and spent most \nof their time together. When one went out the \nother became restless and hastened to rejoin \nher. Together they felt more in harmony with \none another than either of them felt with her- \nself when alone. A feeling stronger than friend- \nship sprang up between them; an exclusive \nfeeling of life being possible only in each \nother's presence. \n\nSometimes they were silent for hours; some- \ntimes after they were already in bed they would \nbegin talking and go on till morning. They \nspoke most of what was long past. Princess \nMary spoke of her childhood, of her mother, \nher father, and her daydreams; and Natdsha, \nwho with a passive lack of understanding had \nformerly turned away from that life of devo- \ntion, submission, and the poetry of Christian \nself-sacrifice, now feeling herself bound to \nPrincess Mary by affection, learned to love her \npast too and to understand a side of life pre- \nviously incomprehensible to her. She did not \nthink of applying submission and self-abnega- \ntion to her own life, for she was accustomed to \nseek other joys, but she understood and loved \nin another those previously incomprehensible \nvirtues. For Princess Mary, listening to Natd- \nsha's tales of childhood and early youth, there \nalso opened out a new and hitherto uncom- \nprehended side of life: belief in life and its \nenjoyment. \n\n\n\n6i8 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nJust as before, they never mentioned him \nso as not to lower (as they thought) their \nexalted feelings by words; but this silence about \nhim had the effect of making them gradually \nbegin to forget him without being conscious \nof it. \n\nNatasha had grown thin and pale and phys- \nically so weak that they all talked about her \nhealth, and this pleased her. But sometimes \nshe was suddenly overcome by fear not only of \ndeath but of sickness, weakness, and loss of \ngood looks, and involuntarily she examined \nher bare arm carefully, surprised at its thin- \nness, and in the morning noticed her drawn \nand, as it seemed to her, piteous face in her \nglass. It seemed to her that things must be so, \nand yet it was dreadfully sad. \n\nOne day she went quickly upstairs and \nfound herself out of breath. Unconsciously \nshe immediately invented a reason for going \ndown, and then, testing her strength, ran up- \nstairs again, observing the result. \n\nAnother time when she called Dunyasha her \nvoice trembled, so she called again though \nshe could hear Dunydsha coming called her \nin the deep chest tones in which she had been \nwont to sing, and listened attentively to herself. \n\nShe did not know and would not have be- \nlieved it, but beneath the layer of slime that \ncovered her soul and seemed to her impene- \ntrable, delicate young shoots of grass were al- \nready sprouting, which taking root would so \ncover with their living verdure the grief that \nweighed her down that it would soon no \nlonger be seen or noticed. The wound had be- \ngun to heal from within. \n\nAt the end of January Princess Mary left for \nMoscow, and the count insisted on Natasha's \ngoing with her to consult the doctors. \n\nCHAPTER IV \n\nAFTER THE ENCOUNTER at Vyazma, where Kutii- \nzov had been unable to hold back his troops in \ntheir anxiety to overwhelm and cut off the \nenemy and so on, the farther movement of the \nfleeing French, and of the Russians who pur- \nsued them, continued as far as Krdsnoe with- \nout a battle. The flight was so rapid that the \nRussian army pursuing the French could not \nkeep up with them; cavalry and artillery \nhorses broke down, and the information re- \nceived of the movements of the French was \nnever reliable. \n\nThe men in the Russian army were so \nworn out by this continuous marching at the \nrate of twenty-seven miles a day that they \n\n\n\ncould not go any faster. \n\nTo realize the degree of exhaustion of the \nRussian army it is only necessary to grasp \nclearly the meaning of the fact that, while \nnot losing more than five thousand killed and \nwounded after Tarutino and less than a hun- \ndred prisoners, the Russian army which left \nthat place a hundred thousand strong reached \nKrdsnoe with only fifty thousand. \n\nThe rapidity of the Russian pursuit was just \nas destructive to our army as the flight of the \nFrench was to theirs. The only difference was \nthat the Russian army moved voluntarily, with \nno such threat of destruction as hung over the \nFrench, and that the sick Frenchmen were left \nbehind in enemy hands while the sick Russians \nleft behind were among their own people. The \nchief cause of the wastage of Napoleon's army \nwas the rapidity of its movement, and a con- \nvincing proof of this is the corresponding de- \ncrease of the Russian army. \n\nKutiizov as far as was in his power, instead \nof trying to check the movement of the French \nas was desired in Petersburg and by the Russian \narmy generals, directed his whole activity here, \nas he had done at Tarutino and Vydzma, to \nhastening it on while easing the movement of \nour army. \n\nBut besides this, since the exhaustion and \nenormous diminution of the army caused by \nthe rapidity of the advance had become evi- \ndent, another reason for slackening the pace \nand delaying presented itself to Kutiizov. The \naim of the Russian army was to pursue the \nFrench. The road the French would take was \nunknown, and so the closer our troops trod on \ntheir heels the greater distance they had to \ncover. Only by following at some distance \ncould one cut across the zigzag path of the \nFrench. All the artful maneuvers suggested by \nour generals meant fresh movements of the \narmy and a lengthening of its marches, where- \nas the only reasonable aim was to shorten those \nmarches. To that end Kutiizov's activity was \ndirected during the whole campaign from Mos- \ncow to Vilna not casually or intermittently \nbut so consistently that he never once deviated \nfrom it. \n\nKutiizov felt and knew not by reasoning or \nscience but with the whole of his Russian be- \ningwhat every Russian soldier felt: that the \nFrench were beaten, that the enemy was flying \nand must be driven out; but at the same time \nhe like the soldiers realized all the hardship of \nthis march, the rapidity of which was unparal- \nleled for such a time of year. \n\n\n\nBOOK FIFTEEN \n\n\n\n619 \n\n\n\nBut to the generals, especially the foreign \nones in the Russian army, who wished to dis- \ntinguish themselves, to astonish somebody, \nand for some reason to capture a king or a \nduke it seemed that now when any battle \nmust be horrible and senseless was the very \ntime to fight and conquer somebody. Kutuzov \nmerely shrugged his shoulders when one after \nanother they presented projects of maneuvers \nto be made with those soldiers ill-shod, in- \nsufficiently clad, and half starved who within \na month and without fighting a battle had \ndwindled to half their number, and who at \nthe best if the flight continued would have to \ngo a greater distance than that they had already \ntraversed, before they reached the frontier. \n\nThis longing to distinguish themselves, to \nmaneuver, to overthrow, and to cut off showed \nitself particularly whenever the Russians stum- \nbled on the French army. \n\nSo it was at Krasnoe, where they expected to \nfind one of the three French columns and \nstumbled instead on Napoleon himself with \nsixteen thousand men. Despite all Kutuzov's \nefforts to avoid that ruinous encounter and to \npreserve his troops, the massacre of the broken \nmob of French soldiers by worn-out Russians \ncontinued at Krasnoe for three days. \n\nToll wrote a disposition: "The first column \nwill march to so and so," etc. And as usual \nnothing happened in accord with the disposi- \ntion. Prince Eugene of Wiirttemberg fired \nfrom a hill over the French crowds that were \nrunning past, and demanded reinforcements \nwhich did not arrive. The French, avoiding \nthe Russians, dispersed and hid themselves in \nthe forest by night, making their way round \nas best they could, and continued their flight. \n\nMiloradovich, who said he did not want to \nknow anything about the commissariat affairs \nof his detachment, and could never be found \nwhen he was wanted that chevalier sans peur \net sans reproche 1 as he styled himself who \nwas fond of parleys with the French, sent en- \nvoys demanding their surrender, wasted time, \nand did not do what he was ordered to do. \n\n"I give you that column, lads," he said, rid- \ning up to the troops and pointing out the \nFrench to the cavalry. \n\nAnd the cavalry, with spurs and sabers urg- \ning on horses that could scarcely move, trotted \nwith much effort to the column presented to \nthem that is to say, to a crowd of Frenchmen \nstark with cold, frost-bitten, and starving and \nthe column that had been presented to them \n\n1 Knight without fear and without reproach. \n\n\n\nthrew down its arms and surrendered as it had \nlong been anxious to do. \n\nAt Krasnoe they took twenty-six thousand \nprisoners, several hundred cannon, and a stick \ncalled a "marshal's staff," and disputed as \nto who had distinguished himself and were \npleased with their achievement though they \nmuch regretted not having taken Napoleon, \nor at least a marshal or a hero of some sort, \nand reproached one another and especially \nKutuzov for having failed to do so. \n\nThese men, carried away by their passions, \nwere but blind tools of the most melancholy \nlaw of necessity, but considered themselves \nheroes and imagined that they were accom- \nplishing a most noble and honorable deed. \nThey blamed Kutuzov and said that from the \nvery beginning of the campaign he had pre- \nvented their vanquishing Napoleon, that he \nthought of nothing but satisfying his passions \nand would not advance from the Linen Fac- \ntories because he was comfortable there, that \nat Krasnoe he checked the advance because \non learning that Napoleon was there he had \nquite lost his head, and that it was probable \nthat he had an understanding with Napoleon \nand had been bribed by him," and so on, and \nso on. \n\nNot only did his contemporaries, carried \naway by their passions, talk in this way, but \nposterity and history have acclaimed Napoleon \nas grand, while Kutuzov is described by for- \neigners as a crafty, dissolute, weak old courtier, \nand by Russians as something indefinite a \nsort of puppet useful only because he had a \nRussian name. \n\nCHAPTER V \n\nIN 1812 and 1813 Kutuzov was openly accused \nof blundering. The Emperor was dissatisfied \nwith him. And in a history recently written by \norder of the Highest Authorities it is said that \nKutuzov was a cunning court liar, frightened \nof the name of Napoleon, and that by his \nblunders at Krasnoe and the Berezina he de- \nprived the Russian army of the glory of com- \nplete victory over the French. 8 \n\nSuch is the fate not of great men (grands \nhommes) whom the Russian mind does not \nacknowledge, but of those rare and always soli- \n\nWilson's Diary.

The character of \nKutuzov and reflections on the unsatisfactory re- \nsults of the battles at Krdsnoe, by Bogdanovich. \nL. TOLSTOY. \n\n\n\n620 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\ntary individuals who, discerning the will of \nProvidence, submit their personal will to it. \nThe hatred and contempt of the crowd punish \nsuch men for discerning the higher laws. \n\nFor Russian historians, strange and terrible \nto say, Napoleon that most insignificant tool \nof history who never anywhere, even in exile, \nshowed human dignity Napoleon is the ob- \nject of adulation and enthusiasm; he is grand. \nBut Kutiizov the man who from the begin- \nning to the end of his activity in 1812, never \nonce swerving by word or deed from Borodin6 \nto Vilna, presented an example exceptional in \nhistory of self-sacrifice and a present conscious- \nness of the future importance of what was \nhappening Kutiizov seems to them something \nindefinite and pitiful, and when speaking of \nhim and of the year 1812 they always seem a \nlittle ashamed. \n\nAnd yet it is difficult to imagine an histori- \ncal character whose activity was so unswerv- \ningly directed to a single aim; and it would be \ndifficult to imagine any aim more worthy or \nmore consonant with the will of the whole \npeople. Still more difficult would it be to find \nan instance in history of the aim of an his- \ntorical personage being so completely accom- \nplished as that to which all Kutiizov's efforts \nwere directed in 1812. \n\nKutiizov never talked of "forty centuries \nlooking down from the Pyramids," of the sac- \nrifices he offered for the fatherland, or of \nwhat he intended to accomplish or had ac- \ncomplished; in general he said nothing about \nhimself, adopted no prose, always appeared to \nbe the simplest and most ordinary of men, and \nsaid the simplest and most ordinary things. \nHe wrote letters to his daughters and to Ma- \ndame de Stael, read novels, liked the society of \npretty women, jested with generals, officers, and \nsoldiers, and never contradicted those who \ntried to prove anything to him. When Count \nRostopchin at the Yaiiza bridge galloped up to \nKutiizov with personal reproaches for having \ncaused the destruction of Moscow, and said: \n"How was it you promised not to abandon \nMoscow without a battle?" Kutiizov replied: \n"And I shall not abandon Moscow without a \nbattle," though Moscow was then already aban- \ndoned. When Arakch^ev, coming to him from \nthe Emperor, said that Erm61ov ought to be \nappointed chief of the artillery, Kutiizov re- \nplied: "Yes, I was justsayingso myself," though \na moment before he had said quite the con- \ntrary. What did it matter to him who then \nalone amid a senseless crowd understood the \n\n\n\nwhole tremendous significance of what was \nhappening what did it matter to him whether \nRostopchin attributed the calamities of Mos- \ncow to him or to himself? Still less could it \nmatter to him who was appointed chief of the \nartillery. \n\nNot merely in these cases but continually \ndid that old man who by experience of life \nhad reached the conviction that thoughts and \nthe words serving as their expression are not \nwhat move people use quite meaningless \nwords that happened to enter his head. \n\nBut that man, so heedless of his words, did \nnot once during the whole time of his activity \nutter one word inconsistent with the single \naim toward which he moved throughout the \nwhole war. Obviously in spite of himself, in \nvery diverse circumstances, he repeatedly ex- \npressed his real thoughts with the bitter con- \nviction that he would not be understood. Be- \nginning with the battle of Borodin6, from \nwhich time his disagreement with those about \nhim began, he alone said that the battle of \nBorodind was a victory, and repeated this \nboth verbally and in his dispatches and re- \nports up to the time of his death. He alone \nsaid that the loss of Moscow is not the loss of \nRussia. In reply to Lauriston's proposal of \npeace, he said: There can be no peace, for such \nis the people's will. He alone during the re- \ntreat of the French said that all our maneuvers \nare useless, everything is being accomplished \nof itself better than we could desire; that the \nenemy must be offered "a golden bridge"; that \nneither the Tarutino, the Vyazma, nor the \nKrdsnoe battles were necessary; that we must \nkeep some force to reach the frontier with, \nand that he would not sacrifice a single Rus- \nsian for ten Frenchmen. \n\nAnd this courtier, as he is described to us, \nwho lies to Arakchdev to please the Emperor, \nhe alone incurring thereby the Emperor's \ndispleasure said in Vflna that to carry the \nwar beyond the frontier is useless and harm- \nful. \n\nNor do words alone prove that only he \nunderstood the meaning of the events. His \nactions without the smallest deviation were \nall directed to one and the same threefold end: \n(i) to brace all his strength for conflict with \nthe French, (2) to defeat them, and (3) to drive \nthem out of Russia, minimizing as far as pos- \nsible the sufferings of our people and of our \narmy. \n\nThis procrastinator Kutiizov, whose motto \nwas "Patience and Time," this enemy of de- \n\n\n\nBOOK FIFTEEN \n\n\n\n621 \n\n\n\ncisive action, gave battle at Borodin6, invest- \ning the preparations for it with unparalleled \nsolemnity. This Kuttizov who before the battle \nof Austerlitz began said that it would be lost, \nhe alone, in contradiction to everyone else, de- \nclared till his death that Borodin6 was a vic- \ntory, despite the assurance of generals that \nthe battle was lost and despite the fact that \nfor an army to have to retire after winning \na battle was unprecedented. He alone during \nthe whole retreat insisted that battles, which \nwere useless then, should not be fought, and \nthat a new war should not be begun nor the \nfrontiers of Russia crossed. \n\nIt is easy now to understand the significance \nof these events if only we abstain from at- \ntributing to the activity of the mass aims that \nexisted only in the heads of a dozen individuals \nfor the events and their results now lie be- \nfore us. \n\nBut how did that old man, alone, in opposi- \ntion to the general opinion, so truly discern \nthe importance of the people's view of the \nevents that in all his activity he was never \nonce untrue to it? \n\nThe source of that extraordinary power of \npenetrating the meaning of the events then \noccuring lay in the national feeling which he \npossessed in full purity and strength. \n\nOnly the recognition of the fact that he pos- \nsessed this feeling caused the people in so \nstrange a manner, contrary to the Tsar's wish, \nto select him an old man in disfavor to be \ntheir representative in the national war. And \nonly that feeling placed him on that highest \nhuman pedestal from which he, the command- \ner in chief, devoted all his powers not to slay- \ning and destroying men but to saving and \nshowing pity on them. \n\nThat simple, modest, and therefore truly \ngreat, figure could not be cast in the false \nmold of a European hero the supposed ruler \nof men that history has invented. \n\nTo a lackey no man can be great, for a \nlackey has his own conception of greatness. \n\nCHAPTER VI \n\nTHE FIFTH OF NOVEMBER was the first day of \nwhat is called the battle of Krasnoe. Toward \nevening after much disputing and many mis- \ntakes made by generals who did not go to \ntheir proper places, and after adjutants had \nbeen sent about with counterorders when it \nhad become plain that the enemy was every- \nwhere in flight and that there could and would \nbe no battle, Kutuzov left Krdsnoe and went \n\n\n\nto D6broe whither his headquarters had that \nday been transferred. \n\nThe day was clear and frosty. Kutuzov rode \nto Dobroe on his plump little white horse, fol- \nlowed by an enormous suite of discontented \ngenerals who whispered among themselves be- \nhind his back. All along the road groups of \nFrench prisoners captured that day (there \nwere seven thousand of them) were crowding \nto warm themselves at campfires. Near D6broe \nan immense crowd of tattered prisoners, buzz- \ning with talk and wrapped and bandaged in \nanything they had been able to get hold of, \nwere standing in the road beside a long row \nof unharnessed French guns. At the approach \nof the commander in chief the buzz of talk \nceased and all eyes were fixed on Kutuzov \nwho, wearing a white cap with a red band and \na padded overcoat that bulged on his round \nshoulders, moved slowly along the road on his \nwhite horse. One of the generals was reporting \nto him where the guns and prisoners had been \ncaptured. \n\nKutuzov seemed preoccupied and did not \nlisten to what the general was saying. He \nscrewed up his eyes with a dissatisfied look as \nhe gazed attentively and fixedly at these prison- \ners, who presented a specially wretched ap- \npearance. Most of them were disfigured by \nfrost-bitten noses and cheeks, and nearly all \nhad red, swollen, and festering eyes. \n\nOne group of the French stood close to the \nroad, and two of them, one of whom had his \nface covered with sores, were tearing a piece \nof raw flesh with their hands. There was some- \nthing horrible and bestial in the fleeting glance \nthey threw at the riders and in the malevolent \nexpression with which, after a glance at Kutu- \nzov, the soldier with the sores immediately \nturned away and went on with what he was \ndoing. \n\nKutuzov looked long and intently at these \ntwo soldiers. He puckered his face, screwed \nup his eyes, and pensively swayed his head. At \nanother spot he noticed a Russian soldier \nlaughingly patting a Frenchman on the \nshoulder, saying something to him in a friendly \nmanner, and Kutuzov with the same expres- \nsion on his face again swayed his head. \n\n"What were you saying?" he asked the gen- \neral, who continuing his report directed the \ncommander in chief's attention to some stand- \nards captured from the French and standing \nin front of the Preobrazh^nsk regiment. \n\n"Ah, the standards! "said Kutiizov, evidently \ndetaching himself with difficulty from the \n\n\n\n622 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nthoughts that preoccupied him. \n\nHe looked about him absently. Thousands of \neyes were looking at him from all sides await- \ning a word from him. \n\nHe stopped in front of the Preobrazh^nsk \nregiment, sighed deeply, and closed his eyes. \nOne of his suite beckoned to the soldiers carry- \ning the standards to advance and surround the \ncommander in chief with them. Kutuzov was \nsilent for a few seconds and then, submitting \nwith evident reluctance to the duty imposed \nby his position, raised his head and began to \nspeak. A throng of officers surrounded him. He \nlooked attentively around at the circle of \nofficers, recognizing several of them. \n\n"I thank you all!" he said, addressing the \nsoldiers and then again the officers. In the still- \nness around him his slowly uttered words were \ndistinctly heard. "I thank you all for your hard \nand faithful service. The victory is complete \nand Russia will not forget you! Honor to you \nforever." \n\nHe paused and looked round. \n\n"Lower its head, lower it!" he said to a \nsoldier who had accidentally lowered the \nFrench eagle he was holding before the Pre- \nobrazhensk standards. "Lower, lower, that's it. \nHurrah, lads!" he added, addressing the men \nwith a rapid movement of his chin. \n\n"Hur-r-rahl" roared thousands of voices. \n\nWhile the soldiers were shouting Kutuzov \nleaned forward in his saddle and bowed his \nhead, and his eye lit up with a mild and ap- \nparently ironic gleam. \n\n"You see, brothers . . ." said he when the \nshouts had ceased . . . and all at once his voice \nand the expression of his face changed. It was \nno longer the commander in chief speaking \nbut an ordinary old man who wanted to tell \nhis comrades something very important. \n\nThere was a stir among the throng of officers \nand in the ranks of the soldiers, who moved \nthat they might hear better what he was going \nto say. \n\n"You see, brothers, I know it's hard for you, \nbut it can't be helped! Bear up; it won't be \nfor long now! We'll see our visitors off and \nthen we'll rest. The Tsar won't forget your \nservice. It is hard for you, but still you are at \nhome while they you see what they have come \nto," said he, pointing to the prisoners. "Worse \noff than our poorest beggars. While they were \nstrong we didn't spare ourselves, but now we \nmay even pity them. They are human beings \ntoo. Isn't it so, lads?" \n\nHe looked around, and in the direct, re- \n\n\n\nspectful, wondering gaze fixed upon him he \nread sympathy with what he had said. His face \ngrew brighter and brighter with an old man's \nmild smile, which drew the corners of his lips \nand eyes into a cluster of wrinkles. He ceased \nspeaking and bowed his head as if in per- \nplexity. \n\n"But after all who asked them here? Serves \nthem right, the bloody bastards!" he cried, sud- \ndenly lifting his head. \n\nAnd flourishing his whip he rode off at a \ngallop for the first time during the whole \ncampaign, and left the broken ranks of the \nsoldiers laughing joyfully and shouting "Hur- \nrah!" \n\nKutuzov's words were hardly understood by \nthe troops. No one could have repeated the \nfield marshal's address, begun solemnly and \nthen changing into an old man's simplehearted \ntalk; but the hearty sincerity of that speech, \nthe feeling of majestic triumph combined with \npity for the foe and consciousness of the justice \nof our cause, exactly expressed by that old \nman's good-natured expletives, was not merely \nunderstood but lay in the soul of every soldier \nand found expression in their joyous and \nlong-sustained shouts. Afterwards when one \nof the generals addressed Kutuzov asking \nwhether he wished his caliche to be sent for, \nKutuzov in answering unexpectedly gave a \nsob, being evidently greatly moved. \n\nCHAPTER VII \n\nWHEN THE TROOPS reached their night's halt- \ning place on the eighth of November, the last \nday of the Krdsnoe battles, it was already grow- \ning dusk. All day it had been calm and frosty \nwith occasional lightly falling snow and to- \nward evening it began to clear. Through the \nfalling snow a purple-black and starry sky \nshowed itself and the frost grew keener. \n\nAn infantry regiment which had left Taru- \ntino three thousand strong but now numbered \nonly nine hundred was one of the first to \narrive that night at its halting place a village \non the highroad. The quartermasters who \nmet the regiment announced that all the huts \nwere full of sick and dead Frenchmen, cavalry- \nmen, and members of the staff. There was on- \nly one hut available for the regimental com- \nmander. \n\nThe commander rode up to his hut. The \nregiment passed through the village and \nstacked its arms in front of the last huts. \n\nLike some huge many-limbed animal, the \nregiment began to prepare its lair and its food. \n\n\n\nBOOK FIFTEEN \n\n\n\n623 \n\n\n\nOne part of it dispersed and waded knee-deep \nthrough the snow into a birch forest to the \nright of the village, and immediately the sound \nof axes and swords, the crashing of branches, \nand merry voices could be heard from there. \nAnother section amid the regimental wagons \nand horses which were standing in a group was \nbusy getting out caldrons and rye biscuit, and \nfeeding the horses. A third section scattered \nthrough the village arranging quarters for the \nstaff officers, carrying out the French corpses \nthat were in the huts, and dragging away \nboards, dry wood, and thatch from the roofs, \nfor the campfires, or wattle fences to serve for \nshelter. \n\nSome fifteen men with merry shouts were \nshaking down the high wattle wall of a shed, \nthe roof of which had already been removed. \n\n"Now then, all togethershovel" cried the \nvoices, and the huge surface of the wall, \nsprinkled with snow and creaking with frost, \nwas seen swaying in the gloom of the night. \nThe lower stakes cracked more and more and \nat last the wall fell, and with it the men who \nhad been pushing it. Loud, coarse laughter \nand joyous shouts ensued. \n\n"Now then, catch hold in twosl Hand up \nthe lever 1 That's it. ... Where are you shoving \nto?" \n\n"Now, all together! But wait a moment, \nboys . . . With a song!" \n\nAll stood silent, and a soft, pleasant velvety \nvoice began to sing. At the end of the third \nverse as the last note died away, twenty voices \nroared out at once: "Oo-oo-oo-oo! That's it. \nAll together! Heave away, boys! . . ." but de- \nspite their united efforts the wattle hardly \nmoved, and in the silence that followed the \nheavy breathing of the men was audible. \n\n"Here, you of the Sixth Company! Devils \nthat you are! Lend a hand . . . will you? You \nmay want us one of these days." \n\nSome twenty men of the Sixth Company \nwho were on their way into the village joined \nthe haulers, and the wattle wall, which was \nabout thirty-five feet long and seven feet high, \nmoved forward along the village street, sway- \ning, pressing upon and cutting the shoulders \nof the gasping men. \n\n"Get along . . . Falling? What are you stop- \nping for? There now. ..." \n\nMerry senseless words of abuse flowed freely. \n\n"What are you up to?" suddenly came the \nauthoritative voice of a sergeant major who \ncame upon the men who were hauling their \nburden. "There are gentry here; the general \n\n\n\nhimself is in that hut, and you foul-mouthed \ndevils, you brutes, I'll give it to youl" shouted \nhe, hitting the first man who came in his way \na swinging blow on the back. "Can't you make \nless noise?" \n\nThe men became silent. The soldier who \nhad been struck groaned and wiped his face, \nwhich had been scratched till it bled by his \nfalling against the wattle. \n\n"There, how that devil hits out! He's made \nmy face all bloody," said he in a frightened \nwhisper when the sergeant major had passed \non. \n\n"Don't you like it?" said a laughing voice, \nand moderating their tones the men moved \nforward. \n\nWhen they were out of the village they be- \ngan talking again as loud as before, interlard- \ning their talk with the same aimless exple- \ntives. \n\nIn the hut which the men had passed, the \nchief officers had gathered and were in ani- \nmated talk over their tea about the events of \nthe day and the maneuvers suggested for to- \nmorrow. It was proposed to make a flank \nmarch to the left, cut off the Vice-King (Murat) \nand capture him. \n\nBy the time the soldiers had dragged the \nwattle fence to its place the campfires were \nblazing on all sides ready for cooking, the \nwood crackled, the snow was melting, and \nblack shadows of soldiers flitted to and fro all \nover the occupied space where the snow had \nbeen trodden down. \n\nAxes and choppers were plied all around. \nEverything was done without any orders be- \ning given. Stores of wood were brought for \nthe night, shelters were rigged up for the \nofficers, caldrons were being boiled, and mus- \nkets and accouterments put in order. \n\nThe wattle wall the men had brought was \nset up in a semicircle by the Eighth Company \nas a shelter from the north, propped up by \nmusket rests, and a campfire was built before \nit. They beat the tattoo, called the roll, had \nsupper, and settled down round the fires for \nthe night some repairing their footgear, some \nsmoking pipes, and some stripping themselves \nnaked to steam the lice out of their shirts. \n\nCHAPTER VIII \n\nONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT that under the al- \nmost incredibly wretched conditions the Rus- \nsian soldiers were in at that timelacking \nwarm boots and sheepskin coats, without a \nroof over their heads, in the snow with eighteen \n\n\n\n624 \n\n\n\ndegrees of frost, 1 and without even full rations \n(the commissariat did not always keep up \nwith the troops) they would have presented \na very sad and depressing spectacle. \n\nOn the contrary, the army had never under \nthe best material conditions presented a more \ncheerful and animated aspect. This was be- \ncause all who began to grow depressed or who \nlost strength were sifted out of the army day \nby day. All the physically or morally weak had \nlong since been left behind and only the \nflower of the army physically and mentally- \nremained. \n\nMore men collected behind the wattle fence \nof the Eighth Company than anywhere else. \nTwo sergeants major were sitting with them \nand their campfire blazed brighter than the \nothers. For leave to sit by their wattle they de- \nmanded contributions of fuel. \n\n"Eh, Makdev! What has become of you, you \nSon of a bitch? Are you lost or have the wolves \neaten you? Fetch some more wood!" shouted \na red-haired and red-faced man, screwing up \nhis eyes and blinking because of the smoke \nbut not moving back from the fire. "And you, \nJackdaw, go and fetch some wood I" said he \nto another soldier. \n\nThis red-haired man was neither a sergeant \nnor a corporal, but being robust he ordered \nabout those weaker than himself. The soldier \nthey called "Jackdaw," a thin little fellow \nwith a sharp nose, rose obediently and was \nabout to go but at that instant there came into \nthe light of the fire the slender, handsome \nfigure of a young soldier carrying a load of \nwood. \n\n"Bring it here that's fine!" \n\nThey split up the wood, pressed it down on \nthe fire, blew at it with their mouths, and \nfanned it with the skirts of their greatcoats, \nmaking the flames hiss and crackle. The men \ndrew nearer and lit their pipes. The handsome \nyoung soldier who had brought the wood, \nsetting his arms akimbo, began stamping his \ncold feet rapidly and deftly on the spot where \nhe stood. \n\n"Mother! The dew is cold but clear It's \n\nwell that I'm a musketeer . . ." he sang, pre- \ntending to hiccough after each syllable. \n\n"Look out, your soles will fly off!" shouted \nthe red-haired man, noticing that the sole of \nthe dancer's boot was hanging loose. "What a \nfellow you are for dancing!" \n\nThe dancer stopped, pulled off the loose \n\n1 R&amp;mmur eight degrees Ijelow zero Fahrenheit. \n-TR. \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\npiece of leather, and threw it on the fire. \n\n"Right enough, friend," said he, and, hav- \ning sat down, took out of his knapsack a scrap \nof blue French cloth, and wrapped it round \nhis foot. "It's the steam that spoils them," he \nadded, stretching out his feet toward the fire. \n\n"They'll soon be issuing us new ones. They \nsay that when we've finished hammering them, \nwe're to receive double kits!" \n\n"And that son of a bitch Petr6v has lagged \nbehind after all, it seems," said one sergeant \nmajor. \n\n"I've had an eye on him this long while," \nsaid the other. \n\n"Well, he's a poor sort of soldier. . . ." \n\n"But in the Third Company they say nine \nmen were missing yesterday." \n\n"Yes, it's all very well, but when a man's \nfeet are frozen how can he walk?" \n\n"Eh? Don't talk nonsense!" said a sergeant \nmajor. \n\n"Do you want to be doing the same?" said \nan old soldier, turning reproachfully to the \nman who had spoken of frozen feet. \n\n"Well, you know," said the sharp-nosed man \nthey called Jackdaw in a squeaky and un- \nsteady voice, raising himself at the other side \nof the fire, "a plump man gets thin, but for a \nthin one it's death. Take me, now! I've got no \nstrength left," he added, with sudden resolu- \ntion turning to the sergeant major. "Tell them \nto send me to hospital; I'm aching all over; \nanyway I shan't be able to keep up." \n\n"That'll do, that'll do!" replied the sergeant \nmajor quietly. \n\nThe soldier said no more and the talk went \n\n\n\n"What a lot of those Frenchies were taken \ntoday, and the fact is that not one of them \nhad what you might call real boots on," said a \nsoldier, starting a new theme. "They were no \nmore than make-believes." \n\n"The Cossacks have taken their boots. They \nwere clearing the hut for the colonel and \ncarried them out. It was pitiful to see them, \nboys," put in the dancer. "As they turned \nthem over one seemed still alive and, would \nyou believe it, he jabbered something in their \nlingo." \n\n"But they're a clean folk, lads," the first \nman went on; "he was white as white as \nbirchbark and some of them are such fine \nfellows, you might think they were nobles." \n\n"Well, what do you think? They make \nsoldiers of all classes there." \n\n"But they don't understand our talk at all/' \n\n\n\nBOOK FIFTEEN \n\n\n\n625 \n\n\n\n&gt;aid the dancer with a puzzled smile. "I asked \nlim whose subject he was, and he jabbered in \nlis own way. A queer lot!" \n\n"But it's strange, friends," continued the \nnan who had wondered at their whiteness, "the \npeasants at Mozhaysk were saying that when \n:hey began burying the dead where the bat- \nLie was you know well, those dead had been \nlying there for nearly a month, and says the \npeasant, 'they lie as white as paper, clean, and \nnot as much smell as a puff of powder smoke.' " \n\n"Was it from the cold?" asked someone. \n\n"You're a clever fellow! From the cold in- \ndeed! Why, it was hot. If it had been from the \ncold, ours would not have rotted either. 'But,' \nhe says, 'go up to ours and they are all rotten \nand maggoty. So/ he says, 'we tie our faces up \nwith kerchiefs and turn our heads away as we \ndrag them off: we can hardly do it. But theirs,' \nhe says, 'are white as paper and not so much \nsmell as a whiff of gunpowder.' " \n\nAll were silent. \n\n"It must be from their food," said the ser- \ngeant major. "They used to gobble the same \nfood as the gentry." \n\nNo one contradicted him. \n\n"That peasant near Mozhdysk where the \nbattle was said the men were all called up \nfrom ten villages around and they carted for \ntwenty days and still didn't finish carting the \ndead away. And as for the wolves, he says . . ." \n\n"That was a real battle," said an old soldier. \n"It's the only one worth remembering; but \nsince that . . . it's only been tormenting folk." \n\n"And do you know, Daddy, the day before \nyesterday we ran at them and, my word, \nthey didn't let us get near before they just \nthrew down their muskets and went on their \nknees. 'Pardon!' they say. That's only one case. \nThey say Pldtov took 'Poleon himself twice. \nBut he didn't know the right charm. He \ncatches him and catches him no good! He \nturns into a bird in his hands and Hies away. \nAnd there's no way of killing him either." \n\n"You're a first-class liar, Kiselev, when I \ncome to look at you!" \n\n"Liar, indeed! It's the real truth." \n\n"If he fell into my hands, when I'd caught \nhim I'd bury him in the ground with an aspen \nstake to fix him down. What a lot of men he's \nruined!" \n\n"Well, anyhow we're going to end it. He \nwon't come here again," remarked the old \nsoldier, yawning. \n\nThe conversation flagged, and the soldiers \nbegan settling down to sleep. \n\n\n\n"Look at the stars. It's wonderful how they \nshine! You would think the women had spread \nout their linen," said one of the men, gazing \nwith admiration at the Milky Way. \n\n"That's a sign of a good harvest next year." \n\n"We shall want some more wood." \n\n"You warm your back and your belly gets \nfrozen. That's queer." \n\n"O Lord!" \n\n"What are you pushing for? Is the fire only \nfor you? Look how he's sprawling!" \n\nIn the silence that ensued, the snoring of \nthose who had fallen asleep could be heard. \nOthers turned over and warmed themselves, \nnow and again exchanging a few words. From \na campfire a hundred paces off came a sound \nof general, merry laughter. \n\n"Hark at them roaring there in the Fifth \nCompany!" said one of the soldiers, "and \nwhat a lot of them there are!" \n\nOne of the men got up and went over to the \nFifth Company. \n\n"They're having such fun," said he, coming \nback. "Two Frenchies have turned up. One's \nquite frozen and the other's an awful swag- \ngerer. He's singing songs. . . ." \n\n"Oh, I'll go across and have a look. . . ." \n\nAnd several of the men went over to the \nFifth Company. \n\nCHAPTER IX \n\nTHE FIFTH COMPANY was bivouacking at the \nvery edge of the forest. A huge campfire was \nblazing brightly in the midst of the snow, \nlighting up the branches of trees heavy with \nhoarfrost. \n\nAbout midnight they heard the sound of \nsteps in the snow of the forest, and the crack- \nling of dry branches. \n\n"A bear, lads," said one of the men. \n\nThey all raised their heads to listen, and out \nof the forest into the bright firelight stepped \ntwo strangely clad human figures clinging to \none another. \n\nThese were two Frenchmen who had been \nhiding in t^e forest. They came up to the fire, \nhoarsely uttering something in a language our \nsoldiers did not understand. One was taller \nthan the other; he wore an officer's hat and \nseemed quite exhausted. On approaching the \nfire he had been going to sit down, but fell. \nThe other, a short sturdy soldier with a shawl \ntied round his head, was stronger. He raised \nhis companion and said something, pointing \nto his mouth. The soldiers surrounded the \nFrenchmen, spread a greatcoat on the ground \n\n\n\n6*6 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nfor the sick man, and brought some buck wheat \nporridge and vodka for both of them. \n\nThe exhausted French officer was Ramballe \nand the man with his head wrapped in the \nshawl was Morel, his orderly. \n\nWhen Morel had drunk some vodka and \nfinished his bowl of porridge he suddenly be- \ncame unnaturally merry and chattered inces- \nsantly to the soldiers, who could not under- \nstand him. Ramballe refused food and rest- \ning his head on his elbow lay silent beside the \ncampfire, looking at the Russian soldiers with \nred and vacant eyes. Occasionally he emitted \na long-drawn groan and then again became \nsilent. Morel, pointing to his shoulders, tried \nto impress on the soldiers the fact that Ram- \nballe was an officer and ought to be warmed. \nA Russian officer who had come up to the fire \nsent to ask his colonel whether he would not \ntake a French officer into his hut to warm him, \nand when the messenger returned and said \nthat the colonel wished the officer to be \nbrought to him, Ramballe was told to go. He \nrose and tried to walk, but staggered and \nwould have fallen had not a soldier standing \nby held him up. \n\n"You won't do it again, eh?" said one of the \nsoldiers, winking and turning mockingly to \nRamballe. \n\n"Oh, you fool! Why talk rubbish, lout that \nyou are a real peasant!" came rebukes from \nall sides addressed to the jesting soldier. \n\nThey surrounded Ramballe, lifted him on \nthe crossed arms of two soldiers, and carried \nhim to the hut. Ramballe put his arms around \ntheir necks while they carried him and began \nwailing plaintively: \n\n"Oh, you fine fellows, my kind, kind friends! \nThese are men! Oh, my brave, kind friends," \nand he leaned his head against the shoulder \nof one of the men like a child. \n\nMeanwhile Morel was sitting in the best \nplace by the fire, surrounded by the soldiers. \n\nMorel, a short sturdy Frenchman with in- \nflamed and streaming eyes, was wearing a \nwoman's cloak and had a shawl yed woman \nfashion round his head over his cap. He was \nevidently tipsy, and was singing a French \nsong in a hoarse broken voice, with an arm \nthrown round the nearest soldier. The soldiers \nsimply held their sides as they watched him. \n\n"Now then, now then, teach us how it goes! \nI'll soon pick it up. How is it?" said the man \na singer and a wag whom Morel was embrac- \ning. \n\n"Vive Henri Quatre! Vive ce roi vaillant!" \n\n\n\nsang Morel, winking. "Ce diable &amp; quatre . . ." * \n\n"Vivarikal Vif-seruvaru! Sedyablyaka!" re- \npeated the soldier, flourishing his arm and \nreally catching the tune. \n\n"Bravo! Ha, ha, ha!" rose their rough, joy- \nous laughter from all sides. \n\nMorel, wrinkling up his face, laughed too. \n\n"Well, go on, go on!" \n\n"Qui eut le triple talent, \nDe boire, de battre, \nEt d'etre un vert galant . . ." 2 \n\n"It goes smoothly, too. Well, now, ZaletAev!" \n\n"Ke . . ." Zaletaev brought out with effort: \n"ke-e-e-e," he drawled, laboriously pursing \nhis lips, "le-trip-ta-la-de-bu-de-ba, e de-tra-va- \nga-la!" he sang. \n\n"Fine! Just like the Frenchie! Oh, ho ho! \nDo you want some more to eat?" \n\n"Give him some porridge: it takes a long \ntime to get filled up after starving." \n\nThey gave him some more porridge and \nMorel with a laugh set to work on his third \nbowl. All the young soldiers smiled gaily as \nthey watched him. The older men, who thought \nit undignified to amuse themselves with such \nnonsense, continued to lie at the opposite side \nof the fire, but one would occasionally raise \nhimself on an elbow and glance at Morel with \na smile. \n\n"They are men too," said one of them as he \nwrapped himself up in his coat. "Even worm- \nwood grows on its own root." \n\n"O Lord, O Lord! How starry it is! Tre- \nmendous! That means a hard frost. . . ." \n\nThey all grew silent. The stars, as if know- \ning that no one was looking at them, began \nto disport themselves in the dark sky: now \nflaring up, now vanishing, now trembling, \nthey were busy whispering something glad- \nsome and mysterious to one another. \n\nCHAPTER X \n\nTHE FRENCH ARMY melted away at the uni- \nform rate of a mathematical progression; and \nthat crossing of the Bere/ina about which so \nmuch has been written was only one inter- \nmediate stage in its destruction, and not at \nall the decisive episode of the campaign. If so \nmuch has been and still is written about the \nBerezina, on the French side this is only be- \n\n1 "Long live Henry the Fourth, that valiant king! \nThat rowdy devil." \n\n* Who had a triple talent \nFor drinking, for fighting, \nAnd for being a gallant old boy . . . \n\n\n\nBOOK FIFTEEN \n\ncause at the broken bridge across that river \nthe calamities their army had been previously \nenduring were suddenly concentrated at one \nmoment into a tragic spectacle that remained \nin every memory, and on the Russian side \nmerely because in Petersburg far from the \nseat of war a plan (again one of Pfuel's) had \nbeen devised to catch Napoleon in a strategic \ntrap at the Berezina River. Everyone assured \nhimself that all would happen according to \nplan, and therefore insisted that it was just \nthe crossing of the Berezina that destroyed the \nFrench army. In reality the results of the cross- \ning were much less disastrous to the French \nin guns and men lost than Krasnoe had been, \nas the figures show. \n\nThe sole importance of the crossing of the \nBerezina lies in the fact that it plainly and \nindubitably proved the fallacy of all the plans \nfor cutting off the enemy's retreat and the \nsoundness of the only possible line of action \nthe one Kutuzov and the general mass of the \narmy demanded namely, simply to follow the \nenemy up. The French crowd fled at a con- \ntinually increasing speed and all its energy \nwas directed to reaching its goal. It fled like a \nwounded animal and it was impossible to \nblock its path. This was shown not so much \nby the arrangements it made for crossing as \nby what took place at the bridges. When the \nbridges broke down, unarmed soldiers, people \nfrom Moscow and women with children who \nwere with the French transport, all carried \non by vis inertiapressed forward into boats \nand into the ice-covered water and did not \nsurrender. \n\nThat impulse was reasonable. The condi- \ntion of fugitives and of pursuers was equally \nbad. As long as they remained with their own \npeople each might hope for help from his \nfellows and the definite place he held among \nthem. But those who surrendered, while re- \nmaining in the same pitiful plight, would be \non a lower level to claim a share in the necessi- \nties of life. The French did not need to be in- \nformed of the fact that half the prisoners \nwith whom the Russians did not know what to \ndo perished of cold and hunger despite their \ncaptors' desire to save them; they felt that it \ncould not be otherwise. The most compassion- \nate Russian commanders, those favorable to \nthe French and even the Frenchmen in the \nRussian service could do nothing for the \nprisoners. The French perished from the con- \nditions to which the Russian army was itself \nexposed. It was impossible to 'take bread and \n\n\n\n627 \n\nclothes from our hungry and indispensable \nsoldiers to give to the French who, though not \nharmful, or hated, or guilty, were simply un- \nnecessary. Some Russians even did that, but \nthey were exceptions. \n\nCertain destruction lay behind the French \nbut in front there was hope. Their ships had \nbeen burned, there was no salvation save in \ncollective flight, and on that the wholestrength \nof the French was concentrated. \n\nThe farther they fled the more wretched be- \ncame the plight of the remnant, especially after \nthe Berezina, on which (in consequence of \nthe Petersburg plan) special hopes had been \nplaced by the Russians, and the keener grew \nthe passions of the Russian commanders, who \nblamed one another and Kutuzov most of all. \nAnticipation that the failure of the Petersburg \nBerezina plan would be attributed to Kutuzov \nled to dissatisfaction, contempt, and ridicule, \nmore and more strongly expressed. The ridi- \ncule and contempt were of course expressed in \na respectful form, making it impossible for \nhim to ask wherein he was to blame. They did \nnot talk seriously to him; when reporting to \nhim or asking for his sanction they appeared \nto be fulfilling a regrettable formality, but \nthey winked behind his back and tried to mis- \nlead him at every turn. \n\nBecause they could not understand him all \nthese people assumed that it was useless to \ntalk to the old man; that he would never grasp \nthe profundity of their plans, that he would \nanswer with his phrases (which they thought \nwere mere phrases) about a "golden bridge," \nabout the impossibility of crossing the frontier \nwith a crowd of tatterdemalions, and so forth. \nThey had heard all that before. And all he \nsaid that it was necessary to await provisions, \nor that the men had no boots was so simple, \nwhile what they proposed was so complicated \nand clever, that it was evident that he was old \nand stupid and that they, though not in power, \nwere commanders of genius. \n\nAfter the junction with the army of the \nbrilliant admiral and Petersburg hero Witt- \ngenstein, this mood and the gossip of the staff \nreached their maximum. Kutuzov saw this \nand merely sighed and shrugged his shoulders. \nOnly once, after the affair of the Berezina, did \nhe get angry and write to Bennigsen (who re- \nported separately to the Emperor) the follow- \ning letter: \n\n"On account of your spells of ill health, will \nyour excellency please be so good as to set off \nfor Kaluga on receipt of this, and there await \n\n\n\n6 2 8 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nfurther commands and appointments from \nHis Imperial Majesty." \n\nBut after Bennigsen's departure, the Grand \nDuke Tsarvich Constantine Pdvlovich joined \nthe army. He had taken part in the beginning \nof the campaign but had subsequently been \nremoved from the army by Kutiizov. Now hav- \ning come to the army, he informed Kutiizov \nof the Emperor's displeasure at the poor suc- \ncess of our forces and the slowness of their \nadvance. The Emperor intended to join the \narmy personally in a few days' time. \n\nThe old man, experienced in court as well \nas in military affairs this same Kutuzov who \nin August had been chosen commander in \nchief against the sovereign's wishes and who \nhad removed the Grand Duke and heir- \napparent from the armywho on his own \nauthority and contrary to the Emperor's will \nhad decided on the abandonment of Moscow, \nnow realized at once that his day was over, \nthat his part was played, and that the power \nhe was supposed to hold was no longer his. \nAnd he understood this not merely from the \nattitude of the court. He saw on the one hand \nthat the military business in which he had \nplayed his part was ended and felt that his \nmission was accomplished; and at the same \ntime he began to be conscious of the physical \nweariness of his aged body and of the necessity \nof physical rest. \n\nOn the twenty-ninth of November Kutuzov \nentered Vflna his "dear Vilna" as he called it. \nTwice during his career Kutuzov had been \ngovernor of Vilna. In that wealthy town, which \nhad not been injured, he found old friends \nand associations, besides the comforts of life \nof which he had so long been deprived. And \nhe suddenly turned from the cares of anny \nand state and, as far as the passions that seethed \naround him allowed, immersed himself in the \nquiet life to which he had formerly been ac- \ncustomed, as if all that was taking place and \nall that had still to be done in the realm of \nhistory did not concern him at all. \n\nChichag6v, one of the most zealous "cutters- \noff" and "breakers-up," who had first wanted \nto effect a diversion in Greece and then in \nWarsaw but never wished to go where he was \nsent: Chichag6v, noted for the boldness with \nwhich he spoke to the Emperor, and who con- \nsidered Kutuzov to be under an obligation to \nhim because when he was sent to make peace \nwith Turkey in 1811 independently of Kutu- \nzov, and found that peace had already been \nconcluded, he admitted to the Emperor that \n\n\n\nthe merit of securing that peace was really \nKutiizov's; this Chichag6v was the first to meet \nKutiizov at the castle where the latter was to \nstay. In undress naval uniform, with a dirk, \nand holding his cap under his arm, he handed \nKutuzov a garrison report and the keys of the \ntown. The contemptuously respectful attitude \nof the younger men to the old man in his dot- \nage was expressed in the highest degree by the \nbehavior of Chichag6v, who knew of the ac- \ncusations that were being directed against \nKutuzov. \n\nWhen speaking to Chichagov, Kutuzov in- \ncidentally mentioned that the vehicles packed \nwith china that had been captured from him \nat Borfsov had been recovered and would be \nrestored to him. \n\n"You mean to imply that I have nothing to \neat out of. ... On the contrary, I can supply \nyou with everything even if you want to give \ndinner parties," warmly replied Chichagov, \nwho tried by every word he spoke to prove \nhis own rectitude and therefore imagined \nKutuzov to be animated by the same de- \nsire. \n\nKutuzov, shrugging his shoulders, replied \nwith his subtle penetrating smile: "I meant \nmerely to say what I said." \n\nContrary to the Emperor's wish Kutuzov \ndetained the greater part of the army at Vilna. \nThose about him said that he became extra- \nordinarily slack and physically feeble during \nhis stay in that town. He attended to army \naffairs reluctantly, left everything to his gen- \nerals, and while awaiting the Emperor's arrival \nled a dissipated life. \n\nHaving left Petersburg on the seventh of \nDecember with his suite Count Tolst6y, \nPrince Volk6nski, Arakchdev, and others the \nEmperor reached Vilna on the eleventh, and \nin his traveling sleigh drove straight to the \ncastle. In spite of the severe frost some hun- \ndred generals and staff officers in full parade \nuniform stood in front of the castle, as well \nas a guard of honor of the Semenov regi- \nment. \n\nA courier who galloped to the castle in ad- \nvance, in a troyka with three foam-flecked \nhorses, shouted "Coming!" and Konovnftsyn \nrushed into the vestibule to inform Kutiizov, \nwho was waiting in the hall porter's little \nlodge. \n\nA minute later the old man's large stout \nfigure in full-dress uniform, his chest covered \nwith orders and a scarf drawn round his stom- \nach, waddled out into the porch. He put on \n\n\n\nBOOK FIFTEEN \n\n\n\n629 \n\n\n\nhis hat with its peaks to the sides and, holding \nhis gloves in his hand and walking with an \neffort sideways down the steps to the level of \nthe street, took in his hand the report he had \nprepared for the Emperor. \n\nThere was running to and fro and whisper- \ning; another troyka flew furiously up, and \nthen all eyes were turned on an approaching \nsleigh in which the figures of the Emperor and \nVolk6nski could already be descried. \n\nFrom the habit of fifty years all this had a \nphysically agitating effect on the old general. \nHe carefully and hastily felt himself all over, \nreadjusted his hat, and pulling himself to- \ngether drew himself up and, at the very mo- \nment when the Emperor, having alighted from \nthe sleigh, lifted his eyes to him, handed him \nthe report and began speaking in his smooth, \ningratiating voice. \n\nThe Emperor with a rapid glance scanned \nKutiizov from head to foot, frowned for an in- \nstant, but immediately mastering himself \nwent up to the old man, extended his arms \nand embraced him. And this embrace too, \nowing to a long-standing impression related \nto his innermost feelings, had its usual effect \non Kutiizov and he gave a sob. \n\nThe Emperor greeted the officers and the \nSemenov guard, and again pressing the old \nman's hand went with him into the castle. \n\nWhen alone with the field marshal the Em- \nperor expressed his dissatisfaction at the slow- \nness of the pursuit and at the mistakes made \nat Krisnoe and the Berezina, and informed \nhim of his intentions for a future campaign \nabroad. Kutiizov made no rejoinder or remark. \nThe same submissive, expressionless look with \nwhich he had listened to the Emperor's com- \nmands on the field of Austerlitz seven years \nbefore settled on his face now. \n\nWhen Kutiizov came out of the study and \nwith lowered head was crossing the ballroom \nwithrtiis heavy waddling gait, he was arrested \nby someone's voice saying: \n\n"Your Serene Highness!" \n\nKutiizov raised his head and looked for a \nlong while into the eyes of Count Tolst6y, \nwho stood before him holding a silver salver \non which lay a small object. Kutiizov seemed \nnot to understand what was expected of \nhim. \n\nSuddenly he seemed to remember; a scarcely \nperceptible smile flashed across his puffy face, \nand bowing low and respectfully he took the \nobject that lay on the salver. It was the Order \nof St. George of the First Class, \n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI \n\nNEXT DAY the field marshal gave a dinner and \nball which the Emperor honored by his pres- \nence. Kutiizov had received the Order of St. \nGeorge of the First Class and the Emperor \nshowed him the highest honors, but everyone \nknew of the imperial dissatisfaction with him. \nThe proprieties were observed and the Emper- \nor was the first to set that example, but every- \nbody understood that the old man was blame- \nworthy and good-for-nothing. When Kutiizov, \nconforming to a custom of Catherine's day, \nordered the standards that had been captured \nto be lowered at the Emperor's feet on his en- \ntering the ballroom, the Emperor made a wry \nface and muttered something in which some \npeople caught the words, "the old comedian." \nThe Emperor's displeasure with Kutiizov \nwas specially increased at Vflna by the fact \nthat Kutiizov evidently could not or would \nnot understand the importance of the coming \ncampaign. \n\nWhen on the following morning the Em- \nperor said to the officers assembled about him: \n"You have not only saved Russia, you have \nsaved Europe!" they all understood that the \nwar was not ended. \n\nKutiizov alone would not see this and open- \nly expressed his opinion that no fresh war \ncould improve the position or add to the glory \nof Russia, but could only spoil and lower the \nglorious position that Russia had gained. He \ntried to prove to the Emperor the impossibil- \nity of levying fresh troops, spoke of the hard- \nships already endured by the people, of the \npossibility of failure and so forth. \n\nThis being the field marshal's frame of mind \nhe was naturally regarded as merely a hin- \ndrance and obstacle to the impending war. \n\nTo avoid unpleasant encounters with the \nold man, the natural method was to do what \nhad been done with him at Austerlitz and with \nBarclay at the beginning of the Russian cam- \npaignto transfer the authority to the Emper- \nor himself, thus cutting the ground from under \nthe commander in chief's feet without upset- \nting the old man by informing him of the \nchange. \n\nWith this object his staff was gradually re- \nconstructed and its real strength removed \nand transferred to the Emperor. Toll, Konov- \nnitsyn, and Erm61ov received fresh appoint- \nments. Everyone spoke loudly of the field \nmarshal's great weakness and failing health. \n\nHis health had to be bad for his place to \nbe taken away and given to another. And in \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nfact his health was poor. \n\nSo naturally, simply, and gradually just as \nhe had come from Turkey to the Treasury in \nPetersburg to recruit the militia, and then to \nthe army when he was needed there now \nwhen his part was played out, Kutuzov's place \nwas taken by a new and necessary performer. \n\nThe war of 1812, besides its national signifi- \ncance dear to every Russian heart, was now to \nassume another, a European, significance. \n\nThe movement of peoples from west to east \nwas to be succeeded by a movement of peoples \nfrom east to west, and for this fresh war an- \nother leader was necessary, having qualities \nand views differing from Kutuzov's and ani- \nmated by different motives. \n\nAlexander I was as necessary for the move- \nment of the peoples from east to west and for \nthe refixing of national frontiers as Kutuzov \nhad been for the salvation and glory of Russia. \n\nKutuzov did not understand what Europe, \nthe balance of power, or Napoleon meant. He \ncould not understand it. For the representative \nof the Russian people, after the enemy had \nbeen destroyed and Russia had been liberated \nand raised to the summit of her glory, there \nwas nothing left to do as a Russian. Nothing \nremained for the representative of the na- \ntional war but to die, and Kutuzov died. \n\nCHAPTER XII \n\nAs GENERALLY HAPPENS, Pierre did not feel the \nfull effects of the physical privation and strain \nhe had suffered as prisoner until after they \nwere over. After his liberation he reached \nOrel, and on the third day there, when pre- \nparing to go to Kiev, he fell ill and was laid \nup for three months. He had what the doctors \ntermed "bilious fever." But despite the fact \nthat the doctors treated him, bled him, and \ngave him medicines to drink, he recovered. \n\nScarcely any impression was left on Pierre's \nmind by all that happened to him from the \ntime of his rescue till his illness. He remem- \nbered only the dull gray weather now rainy \nand now snowy, internal physical distress, and \npains in his feet and side. He remembered a \ngeneral impression of the misfortunes and \nsufferings of people and of being worried by \nthe curiosity of officers and generals who ques- \ntioned him, he also remembered his difficulty \nin procuring a conveyance and horses, and \nabove all he remembered his incapacity to \nthink and feel all that time. On the day of \nhis rescue he had seen the body of Ptya \nRost6v. That same day he had learned that \n\n\n\nPrince Andrew, after surviving the battle of \nBorodin6 for more than a month, had recently \ndied in the Rostovs' house at Yaroslavl, and \nDenfsov who told him this news also mentioned \nHeine's death, supposing that Pierre had \nheard of it long before. All this at the time \nseemed merely strange to Pierre: he felt he \ncould not grasp its significance. Just then he \nwas only anxious to get away as quickly as \npossible from places where people were killing \none another, to some peaceful refuge where \nhe could recover himself, rest, and think over \nall the strange new facts he had learned; but \non reaching Orel he immediately fell ill. When \nhe came to himself after his illness he saw in \nattendance on him two of his servants, Tere*nty \nand Vska, who had come from Moscow; and \nalso his cousin the eldest princess, who had \nbeen living on his estate at Elects and hearing \nof his rescue and illness had come to look after \nhim. \n\nIt was only gradually during his convales- \ncence that Pierre lost the impressions he had \nbecome accustomed to during the last few \nmonths and got used to the idea that no one \nwould oblige him to go anywhere tomorrow, \nthat no one would deprive him of his warm \nbed, and that he would be sure to get his din- \nner, tea, and supper. But for a long time in \nhis dreams he still saw himself in the condi- \ntions of captivity. In the same way little by \nlittle he came to understand the news he had \nbeen told after his rescue, about the death of \nPrince Andrew, the death of his wife, and the \ndestruction of the French. \n\nA joyous feeling of freedom that complete \ninalienable freedom natural to man which \nhe had first experienced at the first halt out- \nside Moscow filled Pierre's soul during his \nconvalescence. He was surprised to find that \nthis inner freedom, which was independent of \nexternal conditions, now had as it were an \nadditional setting of external liberty. He was \nalone in a strange town, without acquaint- \nances. No one demanded anything of him or \nsent him anywhere. He had all he wanted: \nthe thought of his wife which had been a \ncontinual torment to him was no longer there, \nsince she was no more. \n\n"Oh, how good! How splendid!" said he to \nhimself when a cleanly laid table was moved \nup to him with savory beef tea, or when he \nlay down for the night on a soft clean bed, or \nwhen he remembered that the French had \ngone and that his wife was no more. "Oh, how \ngood, how splendid!" \n\n\n\nBOOK FIFTEEN \n\n\n\n631 \n\n\n\nAnd by old habit he asked himself the \nquestion: "Well, and what then? What am \nI going to do?" And he immediately gave him- \nself the answer: "Well, I shall live. Ah, how \nsplendid!" \n\nThe very question that had formerly tor- \nmented him, the thing he had continually \nsought to find the aim of lifeno longer \nexisted for him now. That search for the aim \nof life had not merely disappeared tempo- \nrarilyhe felt that it no longer existed for him \nand could not present itself again. And this \nvery absence of an aim gave him the complete, \njoyous sense of freedom which constituted his \nhappiness at this time. \n\nHe could not see an aim, for he now had \nfaith not faith in any kind of rule, or words, \nor ideas, but faith in an ever-living, ever- \nmanifest God. Formerly he had sought Him \nin aims he set himself. That search for an \naim had been simply a search for God, and \nsuddenly in his captivity he had learned not \nby words or reasoning but by direct feeling \nwhat his nurse had told him long ago: that \nGod is here and everywhere. In his captivity \nhe had learned that in Karatdev God was \ngreater, more infinite and unfathomable than \nin the Architect of the Universe recognized \nby the Freemasons. He felt like a man who \nafter straining his eyes to see into the far dis- \ntance finds what he sought at his very feet. All \nhis life he had looked over the heads of the \nmen around him, when he should have merely \nlooked in front of him without straining his \neyes. \n\nIn the past he had never been able to find \nthat great inscrutable infinite something. He \nhad only felt that it must exist somewhere and \nhad looked for it. In everything near and com- \nprehensible he had seen only what was limited, \npetty, commonplace, and senseless. He had \nequipped himself with a mental telescope and \nlooked into remote space, where petty world- \nliness hiding itself in misty distance had seem- \ned to him great and infinite merely because it \nwas not clearly seen. And such had European \nlife, politics, Freemasonry, philosophy, and \nphilanthropy seemed to him. But even then, \nat moments of weakness as he had accounted \nthem, his mind had penetrated to those dis- \ntances and he had there seen the same petti- \nness, worldliness, and senselessness. Now, how- \never, he had learned to see the great, eternal, \nand infinite in everything, and therefore to \nsee it and enjoy its contemplation he natu- \nrally threw away the telescope through which \n\n\n\nhe had till now gazed over men's heads, and \ngladly regarded the ever-changing, eternally \ngreat, unfathomable, and infinite life around \nhim. And the closer he looked the more tran- \nquil and happy he became. That dreadful ques- \ntion, "What for?" which had formerly destroyed \nall his mental edifices, no longer existed for \nhim. To that question, "What for?" a simple \nanswer was now always ready in his soul: "Be- \ncause there is a God, that God without whose \nwill not one hair falls from a man's head." \n\nCHAPTER XIII \n\nIN EXTERNAL WAYS Pierre had hardly changed \nat all. In appearance he was just what he used \nto be. As before he was absent-minded and \nseemed occupied not with what was before \nhis eyes but with something special of his own. \nThe difference between his former and present \nself was that formerly when he did not grasp \nwhat lay before him or was said to him, he \nhad puckered his forehead painfully as if \nvainly seeking to distinguish something at a \ndistance. At present he still forgot what was \nsaid to him and still did not see what was \nbefore his eyes, but he now looked with a \nscarcely perceptible and seemingly ironic smile \nat what was before him and listened to what \nwas said, though evidently seeing and hearing \nsomething quite different. Formerly he had \nappeared to be a kindhearted but unhappy \nman, and so people had been inclined to avoid \nhim. Now a smile at the joy of life always \nplayed round his lips, and sympathy for others \nshone in his eyes with a questioning look as \nto whether they were as contented as he was, \nand people felt pleased by his presence. \n\nPreviously he had talked a great deal, grew \nexcited when he talked, and seldom listened; \nnow he was seldom carried away in conversa- \ntion and knew how to listen so that people \nreadily told him their most intimate secrets. \n\nThe princess, who had never liked Pierre \nand had been particularly hostile to him since \nshe had felt herself under obligations to him \nafter the old count's death, now after staying \na short time in Orel where she had come in- \ntending to show Pierre that in spite of his in- \ngratitude she considered it her duty to nurse \nhim felt to her surprise and vexation that she \nhad become fond of him. Pierre did not in \nany way seek her approval, he merely studied \nher with interest. Formerly she had felt that he \nregarded her with indifference and irony, and \nso had shrunk into herself as she did with \nothers and had shown him only the combative \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nside of her nature; but now he seemed to be \ntrying to understand the most intimate places \nof her heart, and, mistrustfully at first but \nafterwards gratefully, she let him see the hid- \nden, kindly sides of her character. \n\nThe most cunning man could not have crept \ninto her confidence more successfully, evoking \nmemories of the best times of her youth and \nshowing sympathy with them. Yet Pierre's \ncunning consisted simply in finding pleasure \nin drawing out the human qualities of the \nembittered, hard, and (in her own way) proud \nprincess. \n\n"Yes, he is a very, very kind man when he \nis not under the influence of bad people but \nof people such as myself," thought she. \n\nHis servants too Ter^nty and Vdska in \ntheir own way noticed the change that had \ntaken place in Pierre. They considered that he \nhad become much "simpler." Ter^nty, when \nhe had helped him undress and wished him \ngood night, often lingered with his master's \nboots in his hands and clothes over his arm, \nto see whether he would not start a talk. And \nPierre, noticing that Ter^nty wanted a chat, \ngenerally kept him there. \n\n"Well, tell me ... now, how did you get \nfood?" he would ask. \n\nAnd Ter^nty would begin talking of the \ndestruction of Moscow, and of the old count, \nand would stand for a long time holding the \nclothes and talking, or sometimes listening to \nPierre's stories, and then would go out into \nthe hall with a pleasant sense of intimacy with \nhis master and affection for him. \n\nThe doctor who attended Pierre and visited \nhim every day, though he considered it his \nduty as a doctor to pose as a man whose every \nmoment was of value to suffering humanity, \nwould sit for hours with Pierre telling him his \nfavorite anecdotes and his observations on the \ncharacters of his patients in general, and \nespecially of the ladies. \n\n"It's a pleasure to talk to a man like that; \nhe is not like our provincials," he would \nsay. \n\nThere were several prisoners from the \nFrench army in Orel, and the doctor brought \none of them, a young Italian, to see Pierre. \n\nThis officer began visiting Pierre, and the \nprincess used to make fun of the tenderness \nthe Italian expressed for him. \n\nThe Italian seemed happy only when he \ncould come to see Pierre, talk with him, tell \nhim about his past, his life at home, and his \nlove, and pour out to him his indignation \n\n\n\nagainst the French and especially against Na- \npoleon. \n\n"If all Russians are in the least like you, it \nis sacrilege to fight such a nation," he said to \nPierre. "You, who have suffered so from the \nFrench, do not even feel animosity toward \nthem." \n\nPierre had evoked the passionate affection \nof the Italian merely by evoking the best side \nof his nature and taking a pleasure in so do- \ning. \n\nDuring the last days of Pierre's stay in Orel \nhis old Masonic acqaintance Count Willarski, \nwho had introduced him to the lodge in 1807, \ncame to see him. Willarski was married to a \nRussian heiress who had a large estate in Orel \nprovince, and he occupied a temporary post \nin the commissariat department in that town. \n\nHearing that Beziikhov was in Orel, Will- \narski, though they had never been intimate, \ncame to him with the professions of friendship \nand intimacy that people who meet in a desert \ngenerally express for one another. Willarski \nfelt dull in Orel and was pleased to meet a \nman of his own circle and, as he supposed, of \nsimilar interests. \n\nBut to his surprise Willarski soon noticed \nthat Pierre had lagged much behind the times, \nand had sunk, as he expressed it to himself, \ninto apathy and egotism. \n\n"You are letting yourself go, my dear fel- \nlow," he said. \n\nBut for all that Willarski found it pleasanter \nnow than it had been formerly to be with \nPierre, and came to see him every day. To \nPierre as he looked at and listened to Willar- \nski, it seemed strange to think that he had been \nlike that himself but a short time before. \n\nWillarski was a married man with a family, \nbusy with his family affairs, his wife's affairs, \nand his official duties. He regarded all these \noccupations as hindrances to life, and consid- \nered that they were all contemptible because \ntheir aim was the welfare of himself and his \nfamily. Military, administrative, political, and \nMasonic interests continually absorbed his \nattention. And Pierre, without trying to change \nthe other's views and without condemning \nhim, but with the quiet, joyful, and amused \nsmile now habitual to him, was interested in \nthis strange though very familiar phenomenon. \n\nThere was a new feature in Pierre's rela- \ntions with Willarski, with the princess, with \nthe doctor, and with all the people he now \nmet, which gained for him the general good \nwill. This was his acknowledgment of the im- \n\n\n\nBOOK FIFTEEN \n\npossibility of changing a man's convictions by \nwords, and his recognition of the possibility \nof everyone thinking, feeling, and seeing \nthings each from his own point of view. This \nlegitimate peculiarity of. each individual which \nused to excite and irritate Pierre now became \na basis of the sympathy he felt for, and the \ninterest he took in, other people. The differ- \nence, and sometimes complete contradiction, \nbetween men's opinions and their lives, and be- \ntween one man and another, pleased him and \ndrew from him an amused and gentle smile. \n\nIn practical matters Pierre unexpectedly felt \nwithin himself a center of gravity he had pre- \nviously lacked. Formerly all pecuniary ques- \ntions, especially requests for money to which, \nas an extremely wealthy man, he was very fre- \nquently exposed, produced in him a state of \nhopeless agitation and perplexity. "To give or \nnot to give?" he had asked himself. "I have it \nand he needs it. But someone else needs it still \nmore. Who needs it most? And perhaps they \nare both impostors?" In the old days he had \nbeen unable to find a way out of all these sur- \nmises and had given to all who asked as long \nas he had anything to give. Formerly he had \nbeen in a similar state of perplexity with re- \ngard to every question concerning his property, \nwhen one person advised one thing and an- \nother something else. \n\nNow to his surprise he found that he no \nlonger felt either doubt or perplexity about \nthese questions. There was now within him \na judge who by some rule unknown to him \ndecided what should or should not be done. \n\nHe was as indifferent as heretofore to money \nmatters, but now he felt certain of what ought \nand what ought not to be done. The first time \nhe had recourse to his new judge was when a \nFrench prisoner, a colonel, came to him and, \nafter talking a great deal about his exploits, \nconcluded by making what amounted to a \ndemand that Pierre should give him four \nthousand francs to send to his wife and chil- \ndren. Pierre refused without the least difficulty \nor effort, and was afterwards surprised how \nsimple and easy had been what used to ap- \npear so insurmountably difficult. At the same \ntime that he refused the colonel's demand he \nmade up his mind that he must have recourse \nto artifice when leaving Orel, to induce the \nItalian officer to accept some money of which \nhe was evidently in need. A further proof to \nPierre of his own more settled outlook on \npractical matters was furnished by his decision \nwith regard to his wife's debts and to the re- \n\n\n\n633 \n\n\n\nbuilding of his houses in and near Moscow. \n\nHis head steward came to him at Orel and \nPierre reckoned up with him his diminished \nincome. The burning of Moscow had cost him, \naccording to the head steward's calculation, \nabout two million rubles. \n\nTo console Pierre for these losses the head \nsteward gave him an estimate showing that \ndespite these losses his income would not be \ndiminished but would even be increased if he \nrefused to pay his wife's debts which he was \nunder no obligation to meet, and did not re- \nbuild his Moscow house and the country house \non his Moscow estate, which had cost him \neighty thousand rubles a year and brought in \nnothing. \n\n"Yes, of course that's true," said Pierre with \na cheerful smile. "I don't need all that at all. \nBy being ruined I have become much richer." \n\nBut in January Sav^lich came from Moscow \nand gave him an account of the state of things \nthere, and spoke of the estimate an architect \nhad made of the cost of rebuilding the town \nand country houses, speaking of this as of a set- \ntled matter. About the same time he received \nletters from Prince Vasili and other Peters- \nburg acquaintancesspeakingof his wife'sdebts. \nAnd Pierre decided that the steward's pro- \nposals which had so pleased him were wrong \nand that he must go to Petersburg and settle \nhis wife's affairs and must rebuild in Moscow. \nWhy this was necessary he did not know, but \nhe knew for certain that it was necessary. His \nincome would be reduced by three fourths, \nbut he felt it must be done. \n\nWillarski was going to Moscow and they \nagreed to travel together. \n\nDuring the whole time of his convalescence \nin Orel Pierre had experienced a feeling of \njoy, freedom, and life; but when during his \njourney he found himself in the open world \nand saw hundreds of new faces, that feeling \nwas intensified. Throughout his journey he \nfelt like a schoolboy on holiday. Everyone \nthe stagecoach driver, the post-house overseers, \nthe peasants on the roads and in the villages- \nhad a new significance for him. The presence \nand remarks of Willarski who continually de- \nplored the ignorance and poverty of Russia \nand its backwardness compared with Europe \nonly heightened Pierre's pleasure. Where Will- \narski saw deadness Pierre saw an extraordinary \nstrength and vitality the strength which in \nthat vast space amid the snows maintained the \nlife of this original, peculiar, and unique peo- \nple. He did not contradict Willarski and even \n\n\n\n634 \n\nseemed to agree with himan apparent agree- \nment being the simplest way to avoid discus- \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\nand more difficult and assumed more definite \nforms. \n\n\n\nsions that could lead to nothingand he \nsmiled joyfully as he listened to him. \n\nCHAPTER XIV \n\nIT WOULD BE difficult to explain why and whither \nants whose heap has been destroyed are hurry- \ning: some from the heap dragging bits of rub- \nbish, larvae, and corpses, others back to the \nheap, or why they jostle, overtake one another, \nand fight, and it would be equally difficult to \nexplain what caused the Russians after the \ndeparture of the French to throng to the place \nthat had formerly been Moscow. But when we \nwatch the ants round their ruined heap, the \ntenacity, energy, and immense number of the \ndelving insects prove that despite the destruc- \ntion of the heap, something indestructible, \nwhich though intangible is the real strength of \nthe colony, still exists; and similarly, though \nin Moscow in the month of October there was \nno government and no churches, shrines, riches, \nor housesit was still the Moscow it had been \nin August. All was destroyed, except something \nintangible yet powerful and indestructible. \n\nThe motives of those who thronged from all \nsides to Moscow after it had been cleared of \nthe enemy were most diverse and personal, \nand at first for the most part savage and brutal. \nOne motive only they all had in common: a \ndesire to get to the place that had been called \nMoscow, to apply their activities there. \n\nWithin a week Moscow already had fifteen \nthousand inhabitants, in a fortnight twenty- \nfive thousand, and so on. By the autumn of \n1813 the number, ever increasing and increas- \ning, exceeded what it had been in 1812. \n\nThe first Russians to enter Moscow were \nthe Cossacks of Wint/ingerode's detachment, \npeasants from the adjacent villages, and resi- \ndents who had fled from Moscow and had been \nhiding in its vicinity. The Russians who en- \ntered Moscow, finding it plundered, plundered \nit in their turn. They continued what the \nFrench had begun. Trains of peasant carts \ncame to Moscow to carry off to the villages \nwhat had been abandoned in the ruined \nhouses and the streets. The Cossacks carried \noff what they could to their camps, and the \nhouseholders seized all they could find in other \nhouses and moved it to their own, pretending \nthat it was their property. \n\nBut the first plunderers were followed by a \nsecond and a third contingent, and with in- \ncreasing numbers plundering became more \n\n\n\nThe French found Moscow abandoned but \nwith all the organizations of regular life, with \ndiverse branches of commerce and craftsman- \nship, with luxury, and governmental and re- \nligious institutions. These forms were lifeless \nbut still existed. There were bazaars, shops, \nwarehouses, market stalls, granaries for the \nmost part still stocked with goods and there \nwere factories and workshops, palaces and \nwealthy houses filled with luxuries, hospitals, \nprisons, government offices, churches, and \ncathedrals. The longer the French remained \nthe more these forms of town life perished, \nuntil finally all was merged into one confused, \nlifeless scene of plunder. \n\nThe more the plundering by the French con- \ntinued, the more both the wealth of Moscow \nand the strength of its plunderers was de- \nstroyed. But plundering by the Russians, with \nwhich the reoccupation of the city began, had \nan opposite effect: the longer it continued and \nthe greater the number of people taking part \nin it the more rapidly was the wealth of the \ncity and its regular life restored. \n\nBesides the plunderers, very various people, \nsome drawn by curiosity, some by official duties, \nsome by self-interesthouse owners, clergy, \nofficials of all kinds, tradesmen, artisans, and \npeasants streamed in to Moscow as blood flows \nto the heart. \n\nWithin a week the peasants who came with \nempty carts to carry off plunder were stopped \nby the authorities and made to cart the corpses \nout of the town. Other peasants, having heard \nof their comrades' discomfiture, came to town \nbringing rye, oats, and hay, and beat down \none another's prices to below what they had \nbeen in former days. Gangs of carpenters hop- \ning for high pay arrived in Moscow every day, \nand on all sides logs were being hewn, new \nhouses built, and old, charred ones repaired. \nTradesmen began trading in booths. Cook- \nshops and taverns were opened in partially \nburned houses. The clergy resumed the serv- \nices in many churches that had not been burn- \ned. Donors contributed Church property that \nhad been stolen. Government clerks set up \ntheir baize-covered tables and their pigeon- \nholes of documents in small rooms. The higher \nauthorities and the police organized the dis- \ntribution of goods left behind by the French. \nThe owners of houses in which much property \nhad been left, brought there from other houses, \ncomplained of the injustice of taking every- \n\n\n\nBOOK FIFTEEN \n\n\n\n635 \n\n\n\nthing to the Faceted Palace in the Kremlin; \nothers insisted that as the French had gathered \nthings from different houses into this or that \nhouse, it would be unfair to allow its owner \nto keep all that was found there. They abused \nthe police and bribed them, made out esti- \nmates at ten times their value for government \nstores that had perished in the fire, and de- \nmanded relief. And Count Rostopchin wrote \nproclamations. \n\nCHAPTER XV \n\nAT THE END of January Pierre went to Moscow \nand stayed in an annex of his house which had \nnot been burned. He called on Count Ros- \ntopchfn and on some acquaintances who were \nback in Moscow, and he intended to leave for \nPetersburg two days later. Everybody was cele- \nbrating the victory, everything was bubbling \nwith life in the ruined but reviving city. Every- \none was pleased to see Pierre, everyone wished \nto meet him, and everyone questioned him \nabout what he had seen. Pierre felt particularly \nwell disposed toward them all, but was now \ninstinctively on his guard for fear of binding \nhimself in any way. To all questions put to \nhimwhether important or quite trifling such \nas: Where would he live? Was he going to re- \nbuild? When was he going to Petersburg and \nwould he mind taking a parcel for someone? \nhe replied: "Yes, perhaps," or, "I think so," \nand so on. \n\nHe had heard that the Rost6vs were at Kos- \ntromd but the thought of Natasha seldom \noccurred to him. If it did it was only as a pleas- \nant memory of the distant past. He felt him- \nself not only free from social obligations but \nalso from that feeling which, it seemed to him, \nhe had aroused in himself. \n\nOn the third day after his arrival he heard \nfrom the Drubetsk6ys that Princess Mary was \nin Moscow. The death, sufferings, and last days \nof Prince Andrew had often occupied Pierre's \nthoughts and now recurred to him with fresh \nvividness. Having heard at dinner that Prin- \ncess Mary was in Moscow and living in her \nhouse which had not been burned in Voz- \ndvizhenka Street, he drove that same evening \nto see her. \n\nOn his way to the house Pierre kept think- \ning of Prince Andrew, of their friendship, of \nhis various meetings with him, and especially \nof the last one at Borodin6. \n\n"Is it possible that he died in the bitter frame \nof mind he was then in? Is it possible that the \nmeaning of life was not disclosed to him be- \n\n\n\nfore he died?" thought Pierre. He recalled \nKarataev and his death and involuntarily be- \ngan to compare these two men, so different, \nand yet so similar in that they had both lived \nand both died and in the love he felt for both \nof them. \n\nPierre drove up to the house of the old \nprince in a most serious mood. The house had \nescaped the fire; it showed signs of damage but \nits general aspect was unchanged. The old foot- \nman, who met Pierre with a stern face as if \nwishing to make the visitor feel that the ab- \nsence of the old prince had not disturbed the \norder of things in the house, informed him \nthat the princess had gone to her own apart- \nments, and that she received on Sundays. \n\n"Announce me. Perhaps she will see me," \nsaid Pierre. \n\n"Yes, sir," said the man. "Please step into \nthe portrait gallery." \n\nA few minutes later the footman returned \nwith Dessalles, who brought word from the \nprincess that she would be very glad to see \nPierre if he would excuse her want of cere- \nmony and come upstairs to her apartment. \n\nIn a rather low room lit by one candle sat \nthe princess and with her another person \ndressed in black. Pierre remembered that the \nprincess always had lady companions, but who \nthey were and what they were like he never \nknew or remembered. "This must be one of \nher companions," he thought, glancing at the \nlady in the black dress. \n\nThe princess rose quickly to meet him and \nheld out her hand. \n\n"Yes," she said, looking at his altered face \nafter he had kissed her hand, "so this is how we \nmeet again. He often spoke of you even at the \nvery last," she went on, turning her eyes from \nPierre to her companion with a shyness that \nsurprised him for an instant. \n\n"I was so glad to hear of your safety. It was \nthe first piece of good news we had received \nfor a long time." \n\nAgain the princess glanced round at her \ncompanion with even more uneasiness in her \nmanner and was about to add something, but \nPierre interrupted her. \n\n"Just imagine I knew nothing about him!" \nsaid he. "I thought he had been killed. All I \nknow I heard at second hand from others. I \nonly know that he fell in with the Rost6vs. \n. . . What a strange coincidence 1" \n\nPierre spoke rapidly and with animation. He \nglanced once at the companion's face, saw her \nattentive and kindly gaze fixed on him, and, \n\n\n\n636 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nas often happens when one is talking, felt \nsomehow that this companion in the black \ndress was a good, kind, excellent creature who \nwould not hinder his conversing freely with \nPrincess Mary. \n\nBut when he mentioned the Rost6vs, Prin- \ncess Mary's face expressed still greater embar- \nrassment. She again glanced rapidly from \nPierre's face to that of the lady in the black \ndress and saidT \n\n"Do you really not recognize her?" \n\nPierre looked again at the companion's pale, \ndelicate face with its black eyes and peculiar \nmouth, and something near to him, long for- \ngotten and more than sweet, looked at him \nfrom those attentive eyes. \n\n"But no, it can't be!" he thought. "This \nstern, thin, pale face that looks so much older! \nIt cannot be she. It merely reminds me of her." \nBut at that moment Princess Mary said, "Natd- \nsha!" And with difficulty, effort, and stress, like \nthe opening of a door grown rusty on its hinges, \na smile appeared on the face with the atten- \ntive eyes, and from that opening door came a \nbreath of fragrance which suffused Pierre with \na happiness he had long forgotten and of which \nhe had not even been thinking especially at \nthat moment. It suffused him, seized him, and \nenveloped him completely. When she smiled \ndoubt was no longer possible, it was Natasha \nand he loved her. \n\nAt that moment Pierre involuntarily be- \ntrayed to her, to Princess Mary, and above all \nto himself, a secret of which he himself had \nbeen unaware. He flushed joyfully yet with \npainful distress. He tried to hide his agitation. \nBut the more he tried to hide it the more \nclearly clearer than any words could have \ndonedid he betray to himself, to her, and to \nPrincess Mary that he loved her. \n\n"No, it's only the unexpectedness of it," \nthought Pierre. But as soon as he tried to con- \ntinue the conversation he had begun with \nPrincess Mary he again glanced at Natasha, \nand a still-deeper flush suffused his face and \na still-stronger agitation of mingled joy and \nfear seized his soul. He became confused in his \nspeech and stopped in the middle of what he \nwas saying. \n\nPierre had failed to notice Natasha because \nhe did not at all expect to see her there, but he \nhad failed to recognize her because the change \nin her since he last saw her was immense. She \nhad grown thin and pale, but that was not \nwhat made her unrecognizable; she was un- \nrecognizable at the moment he entered because \n\n\n\non that face whose eyes had always shone with \na suppressed smile of the joy of life, now when \nhe first entered and glanced at her there was \nnot the least shadow of a smile: only her eyes \nwere kindly attentive and sadly interrogative. \nPierre's confusion was not reflected by any \nconfusion on Natdsha's part, but only by the \npleasure that just perceptibly lit up her whole \nface. \n\nCHAPTER XVI \n\n"SHE HAS COME to stay with me," said Princess \nMary. "The count and countess will be here \nin a few days. The countess is in a dreadful \nstate; but it was necessary for Natasha herself \nto see a doctor. They insisted on her coming \nwith me." \n\n"Yes, is there a family free from sorrow now?" \nsaid Pierre, addressing Natdsha. "You know \nit happened the very day we were rescued. I \nsaw him. What a delightful boy he was!" \n\nNatdsha looked at him, and by way of an- \nswer to his words her eyes widened and lit up. \n\n"What can one say or think of as a consola- \ntion?" said Pierre. "Nothing! Why had such a \nsplendid boy, so full of life, to die?" \n\n"Y^s, in these days it would be hard to live \nwithout faith . . ." remarked Princess Mary. \n\n"Yes, yes, that is really true," Pierre hastily \ninterrupted her. \n\n"Why is it true?" Natdsha asked, looking at- \ntentively into Pierre's eyes. \n\n"How can you ask why?" said Princess Mary. \n"The thought alone of what awaits . . ." \n\nNatdsha without waiting for Princess Mary \nto finish again looked inquiringly at Pierre. \n\n"And because," Pierre continued, "only one \nwho believes that there is a God ruling us can \nbear a loss such as hers and . . . yours." \n\nNatdsha had already opened her mouth to \nspeak but suddenly stopped. Pierre hurriedly \nturned away from her and again addressed \nPrincess Mary, asking about his friend's last \ndays. \n\nPierre's confusion had now almost vanished, \nbut at the same time he felt that his freedom \nhad also completely gone. He felt that there \nwas now a judge of his every word and action \nwhose judgment mattered more to him than \nthat of all the rest of the world. As he spoke \nnow he was considering what impression his \nwords would make on Natdsha. He did not \npurposely say things to please her, but what- \never he was saying he regarded from her stand- \npoint. \n\nPrincess Mary reluctantly as is usual in such \n\n\n\nBOOK FIFTEEN \n\ncases began telling of the condition in which \nshe had found Prince Andrew. But Pierre's \nface quivering with emotion, his questions and \nhis eager restless expression, gradually com- \npelled her to go into details which she feared \nto recall for her own sake. \n\n"Yes, yes, and so ... ?" Pierre kept saying \nas he leaned toward her with his whole body \nand eagerly listened to her story. "Yes, yes ... \nso he grew tranquil and softened? With all his \nsoul he had always sought one thing to be \nperfectly good so he could not be afraid of \ndeath. The faults he had if he had any were \nnot of his making. So he did soften? . . . What \na happy thing that he saw you again," he added, \nsuddenly turning to Natasha and looking at \nher with eyes full of tears. \n\nNatasha's face twitched. She frowned and \nlowered her eyes for a moment. She hesitated \nfor an instant whether to speak or not. \n\n"Yes, that was happiness," she then said in \nher quiet voice with its deep chest notes. "For \nme it certainly was happiness." She paused. \n"And he ... he ... he said he was wishing for \nit at the very moment I entered the room. . . ." \n\nNatdsha's voice broke. She blushed, pressed \nher clasped hands on her knees, and then con- \ntrolling herself with an evident effort lifted \nher head and began to speak rapidly. \n\n"We knew nothing of it when we started \nfrom Moscow. I did not dare to ask about him. \nThen suddenly S6nya told me he was traveling \nwith us. I had no idea and could not imagine \nwhat state he was in, all I wanted was to see \nhim and be with him," she said, trembling, \nand breathing quickly. \n\nAnd not letting them interrupt her she went \non to tell what she had never yet mentioned \nto anyone all she had lived through during \nthose three weeks of their journey and life at \nYarosldvl. \n\nPierre listened to her with lips parted and \neyes fixed upon her full of tears. As he listened \nhe did not think of Prince Andrew, nor of \ndeath, nor of what she was telling. He listened \nto her and felt only pity for her, for what she \nwas suffering now while she was speaking. \n\nPrincess Mary, frowning in her effort to \nhold back her tears, sat beside Natdsha, and \nheard for the first time the story of those last \ndays of her brother's and Natdsha's love. \n\nEvidently Natdsha needed to tell that pain- \nful yet joyful tale. \n\nShe spoke, mingling most trifling details \nwith the intimate secrets of her soul, and it \nseemed as if she could never finish. Several \n\n\n\n637 \ntimes she repeated the same thing twice. \n\nDessalles' voice was heard outside the door \nasking whether little Nicholas might come in \nto say good night. \n\n"Well, that's all everything," said Natdsha. \n\nShe got up quickly just as Nicholas entered, \nalmost ran to the door which was hidden by \ncurtains, struck her head against it, and rushed \nfrom the room with a moan either of pain or \nsorrow. \n\nPierre gazed at the door through which she \nhad disappeared and did not understand why \nhe suddenly felt-all alone in the world. \n\nPrincess Mary roused him from his abstrac- \ntion by drawing his attentioa to her nephew \nwho had entered the room. \n\nAt that moment of emotional tenderness \nyoung Nicholas' face, which resembled his \nfather's, affected Pierre so much that when he \nhad kissed the boy he got up quickly, took out \nhis handkerchief, and went to the window. He \nwished to take leave of Princess Mary, but she \nwould not let him go. \n\n"No, Natdsha and I sometimes don't go to \nsleep till after two, so please don't go. I will \norder supper. Go downstairs, we will come im- \nmediately." \n\nBefore Pierre left the room Princess Mary \ntold him: "This is the first time she has talked \nof him like that." \n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII \n\nPIERRE WAS SHOWN into the large, brightly lit \ndining room; a few minutes later he heard \nfootsteps and Princess Mary entered with \nNatdsha. Natdsha was calm, though a severe \nand grave expression had again settled on her \nface. They all three of them now experienced \nthat feeling of awkwardness which usually fol- \nlows after a serious and heartfelt talk. It is im- \npossible to go back to the same conversation, to \ntalk of trifles is awkward, and yet the desire \nto speak is there and silence seems like affecta- \ntion. They went silently to table. The foot- \nmen drew back the chairs and pushed them up \nagain. Pierre unfolded his cold table napkin \nand, resolving to break the silence, looked at \nNatdsha and at Princess Mary. They had evi- \ndently both formed the same resolution; the \neyes of both shone with satisfaction and a con- \nfession that besides sorrow life also has joy. \n\n"Do you take vodka, Count?" asked Princess \nMary, and those words suddenly banished the \nshadows of the past, "Now tell us about your- \nself," said she. "One hears such improbable \nwonders about you/' \n\n\n\n638 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\n"Yes," replied Pierre with the smile of mild \nirony now habitual to him. "They even tell \nme wonders I myself never dreamed of 1 Mary \nAbrdmovna invited me to her house and kept \ntelling me what had happened, or ought to \nhave happened, to me. Stepan Stepanych also \ninstructed me how I ought to tell of my expe- \nriences. In general I have noticed that it is \nvery easy to be an interesting man (I am an in- \nteresting man now); people invite me out and \ntell me all about myself." \n\nNatasha smiled and was on the point of \nspeaking. \n\n"We have been told," Princess Mary inter- \nrupted her, "that you lost two millions in \nMoscow. Is that true?" \n\n"But I am three times as rich as before,'* re- \nturned Pierre. \n\nThough the position was now altered by his \ndecision to pay his wife's debts and to rebuild \nhis houses, Pierre still maintained that he had \nbecome three times as rich as before. \n\n"What I have certainly gained is freedom," \nhe began seriously, but did not continue, no- \nticing that this theme was too egotistic. \n\n"And are you building?" \n\n"Yes. Savelich says I must!" \n\n"Tell me, you did not know of the countess' \ndeath when you decided to remain in Mos- \ncow?" asked Princess Mary and immediately \nblushed, noticing that her question, following \nhis mention of freedom, ascribed to his words \na meaning he had perhaps not intended. \n\n"No," answered Pierre, evidently not con- \nsidering awkward the meaning Princess Mary \nhad given to his words. "I heard of it in Orel \nand you cannot imagine how it shocked me. \nWe were not an exemplary couple," he added \nquickly, glancing at Natdsha and noticing on \nher face curiosity as to how he would speak of \nhis wife, "but her death shocked me terribly. \nWhen two people quarrel they are always both \nin fault, and one's own guilt suddenly becomes \nterribly serious when the other is no longer \nalive. And then such a death . . . without friends \nand without consolation! I am very, very sorry \nfor her," he concluded, and was pleased to no- \ntice a look of glad approval on Natasha's face. \n\n"Yes, and so you are once more an eligible \nbachelor," said Princess Mary. \n\nPierre suddenly flushed crimson and for a \nlong time tried not to look at Natdsha. When \nhe ventured to glance her way again her face \nwas cold, stern, and he fancied even con- \ntemptuous. \n\n"And did you really see and speak to Na- \n\n\n\npoleon, as we have been told?" said Princess \nMary. \n\nPierre laughed. \n\n"No, not oncel Everybody seems to imagine \nthat being taken prisoner means being Napo- \nleon's guest. Not only did I never see him but \nI heard nothing about himI was in much \nlower company!" \n\nSupper was over, and Pierre who at first de- \nclined to speak about his captivity was gradu- \nally led on to do so. \n\n"But it's true that you remained in Moscow \nto kill Napoleon?" Natdsha asked with a slight \nsmile. "I guessed it then when we met at the \nSukharev tower, do you remember?" \n\nPierre admitted that it was true, and from \nthat was gradually led by Princess Mary's ques- \ntions and especially by Natasha's into giving \na detailed account of his adventures. \n\nAt first he spoke with the amused and mild \nirony now customary with him toward every- \nbody and especially toward himself, but when \nhe came to describe the horrors and sufferings \nhe had witnessed he was unconsciously car- \nried away and began speaking with the sup- \npressed emotion of a man re-experiencing in \nrecollection strong impressions he has lived \nthrough. \n\nPrincess Mary with a gentle smile looked \nnow at Pierre and now at Natasha. In the \nwhole narrative she saw only Pierre and his \ngoodness. Natasha, leaning on her elbow, the \nexpression of her face constantly changing \nwith the narrative, watched Pierre with an \nattention that never wanderedevidently her- \nself experiencing all that he described. Not \nonly her look, but her exclamations and the \nbrief questions she put, showed Pierre that she \nunderstood just what he wished to convey. It \nwas clear that she understood not only what \nhe said but also what he wished to, but could \nnot, express in words. The account Pierre \ngave of the incident with the child and the \nwoman for protecting whom he was arrested \nwas this: "It was an awful sight children aban- \ndoned, some in the flames . . . One was snatched \nout before my eyes . . . and there were women \nwho had their things snatched off and their \nearrings torn out . . ." he flushed and grew con- \nfused. "Then a patrol arrived and all the men \nall those who were not looting, that is were \narrested, and I among them." \n\n"I am sure you're not telling us everything; \nI am sure you did something . . ." said Natdsha, \nand pausing added, "something fine?" \n\nPierre continued. When he spoke of the exe- \n\n\n\nBOOK FIFTEEN \n\n\n\n639 \n\n\n\ncution he wanted to pass over the horrible de- \ntails, but Natasha insisted that he should not \nomit anything. \n\nPierre began to tell about Karatdev, but \npaused. By this time he had risen from the ta- \nble and was pacing the room, Natasha follow- \ning him with her eyes. Then he added: \n\n"No, you can't understand what I learned \nfrom that illiterate manthat simple fellow." \n\n"Yes, yes, go onl" said Natdsha. "Where is \nhe?" \n\n"They killed him almost before my eyes." \n\nAnd Pierre, his voice trembling continually, \nwent on to tell of the last days of their retreat, \nof Karatdev's illness and his death. \n\nHe told of his adventures as he had never \nyet recalled them. He now, as it were, saw a \nnew meaning in all he had gone through. Now \nthat he was telling it all to Natdsha he experi- \nenced that pleasure which a man has when \nwomen listen to himnot clever women who \nwhen listening either try to remember what \nthey hear to enrich their minds and when op- \nportunity offers to retell it, or who wish to \nadopt it to some thought of their own and \npromptly contribute their own clever com- \nments prepared in their own little mental work- \nshop but the pleasure given by real women \ngifted with a capacity to select and absorb the \nvery best a man shows of himself. Natasha with- \nout knowing it was all attention: she did not \nlose a word, no single quiver in Pierre's voice, \nno look, no twitch of a muscle in his face, nor \na single gesture. She caught the unfinished \nword in its flight and took it straight into her \nopen heart, divining the secret meaning of all \nPierre's mental travail. \n\nPrincess Mary understood his story and sym- \npathized with him, but she now saw something \nelse that absorbed all her attention. She saw \nthe possibility of love and happiness between \nNatasha and Pierre, and the first thought of \nthis filled her heart with gladness. \n\nIt was three o'clock in the morning. The \nfootmen came in with sad and stern faces to \nchange the candles, but no one noticed them. \n\nPierre finished his story. Natasha continued \nto look at him intently with bright, attentive, \nand animated eyes, as if trying to understand \nsomething more which he had perhaps left un- \ntold. Pierre in shamefaced and happy confu- \nsion glanced occasionally at her, and tried to \nthink what to say next to introduce a fresh \nsubject. Princess Mary was silent. It occurred \nto none of them that it was three o'clock and \ntime to go to bed. \n\n\n\n"People speak of misfortunes and suffer- \nings," remarked Pierre, "but if at this moment \nI were asked: 'Would you rather be what you \nwere before you were taken prisoner, or go \nthrough all this again?' then for heaven's sake \nlet me again have captivity and horsefleshl \nWe imagine that when we are thrown out of \nour usual ruts all is lost, but it is only then that \nwhat is new and good begins. While there is \nlife there is happiness. There is much, much \nbefore us. I say this to you," he added, turning \nto Natdsha. \n\n"Yes, yes," she said, answering something \nquite different. "I too should wish nothing but \nto relive it all from the beginning." \n\nPierre looked intently at her. \n\n"Yes, and nothing more," said Natdsha. \n\n"It's not true, not true!" cried Pierre. "I am \nnot to blame for beingalive and wishing to live \nnor you either." \n\nSuddenly Natasha bent her head, covered \nher face with her hands, and began to cry. \n\n"What is it, Natdsha?" said Princess Mary. \n\n"Nothing, nothing." She smiled at Pierre \nthrough her tears. "Good night! It is time for \nbed." \n\nPierre rose and took his leave. \n\nPrincess Mary and Natdsha met as usual in \nthe bedroom. They talked of what Pierre had \ntold them. Princess Mary did not express her \nopinion of Pierre nor did Natasha speak of \nhim. \n\n"Well, good night, Mary!' 1 said Natasha. \n"Do you know, I am often afraid that by not \nspeaking of him" (she meant Prince Andrew) \n"for fear of not doing justice to our feelings, \nwe forget him." \n\nPrincess Mary sighed deeply and thereby ac- \nknowledged the justice of Natasha's remark, \nbut she did not express agreement in words. \n\n"Is it possible to forget?" said she. \n\n"It did me so much good to tell all about it \ntoday. It was hard and painful, but good, very \ngood!" said Natdsha. "I am sure he really loved \nhim. That is why I told him . . . Was it all \nright?" she added, suddenly blushing. \n\n"To tell Pierre? Oh, yes. What a splendid \nman he is!" said Princess Mary. \n\n"Do you know, Mary . . ." Natdsha suddenly \nsaid with a mischievous smile such as Princess \nMary had not seen on her face for a long time, \n"he has somehow grown so clean, smooth, and \nfreshas if he had just come out of a Russian \nbath; do you understand? Out of a moral bath. \nIsn't it true?" \n\n\n\n640 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\n"Yes," replied Princess Mary. "He has great- \nly improved." \n\n"With a short coat and his hair cropped; \njust as if, well, just as if he had come straight \nfrom the bath . . . Papa used to ..." \n\n"I understand why he" (Prince Andrew) \n"liked no one so much as him," said Princess \nMary. \n\n"Yes, and yet he is quite different. They say \nmen are friends when they are quite different. \nThat must be true. Really he is quite unlike \nhim in everything." \n\n"Yes, but he's wonderful." \n\n"Well, good night," said Natdsha. \n\nAnd the same mischievous smile lingered \nfor a long time on her face as if it had been \nforgotten there. \n\nCHAPTER XVIII \n\nIT WAS A LONG TIME before Pierre could fall \nasleep that night. He paced up and down his \nroom, now turning his thoughts on a difficult \nproblem and frowning, now suddenly shrug- \nging his shoulders and wincing, and now smil- \ning happily. \n\nHe was thinking of Prince Andrew, of Nata- \nsha, and of their love, at one moment jealous \nof her past, then reproaching himself for that \nfeeling. It was already six in the morning and \nhe still paced up and down the room. \n\n"Well, what's to be done if it cannot be \navoided? What's to be done? Evidently it has \nto be so," said he to himself, and hastily un- \ndressing he got into bed, happy and agitated \nbut free from hesitation or indecision. \n\n"Strange and impossible as such happiness \nseems, I must do everything that she and 1 \nmay be man and wife," he told himself. \n\nA few days previously Pierre had decided to \ngo to Petersburg on the Friday. When he awoke \non the Thursday, Savlich came to ask him \nabout packing for the journey. \n\n"What, to Petersburg? What is Petersburg? \nWho is therein Petersburg?" he asked involun- \ntarily, though only to himself. "Oh, yes, long \nago before this happened I did for some reason \nmean to go to Petersburg," he reflected. "Why? \nBut perhaps I shall go. What a good fellow he is \nand how attentive, and how he remembers \neverything," he thought, looking at Sav^lich's \nold face, "and what a pleasant smile he has!" \n\n"Well, Sav&amp;ich, do you still not wish to ac- \ncept your freedom?" Pierre asked him. \n\n"What's the good of freedom to me, your \nexcellency? We lived under the late count the \nkingdom of heaven be his! and we have lived \n\n\n\nunder you too, without ever being wronged." \n\n"And your children?" \n\n"The children will live just the same. With \nsuch masters one can live." \n\n"But what about my heirs?" said Pierre. \n"Supposing I suddenly marry ... it might hap- \npen," he added with an involuntary smile. \n\n"If I may take the liberty, your excellency, it \nwould be a good thing." \n\n"How easy he thinks it," thought Pierre. "He \ndoesn't know how terrible it is and how dan- \ngerous. Too soon or too late ... it is terrible!" \n\n"So what are your orders? Are you starting \ntomorrow?" asked Save*lich. \n\n"No, I'll put it off for a bit. I'll tell you later. \nYou must forgive the trouble I have put you \nto," said Pierre, and seeing Save*lich smile, he \nthought: "But how strange it is that he should \nnot know that now there is no Petersburg for \nme, and that that must be settled first of all! \nBut probably he knows it well enough and is \nonly pretending. Shall I have a talk with him \nand see what he thinks?" Pierre reflected. "No, \nanother time." \n\nAt breakfast Pierre told the princess, his \ncousin, that he had been to see Princess Mary \nthe day before and had there met "Whom do \nyou think? Natasha Rost6va!" \n\nThe princess seemed to see nothing more \nextraordinary in that than if he had seen Anna \nSemenovna. \n\n"Do you know her?" asked Pierre. \n\n"I have seen the princess," she replied. "I \nheard that they were arranging a match for \nher with young Rost6v. It would be a very \ngood thing for the Rost6vs, they are said to \nbe utterly ruined." \n\n"No; I mean doyouknowNatdsha Rost6va?" \n\n"1 heard about that affair of hers at the time. \nIt was a great pity." \n\n"No, she either doesn't understand or is pre- \ntending," thought Pierre. "Better not say any- \nthing to her either." \n\nThe princess too had prepared provisions \nfor Pierre's journey. \n\n"How kind they all are," thought Pierre. \n"What is surprising is that they should trouble \nabout these things now when it can no longer \nbe of interest to them. And all for me!" \n\nOn the same day the Chief of Police came \nto Pierre, inviting him to send a representative \nto the Faceted Palace to recover things that \nwere to be returned to their owners that day. \n\n"And this man too," thought Pierre, looking \ninto the face of the Chief of Police. "What a \nfine, good-looking officer and how kind. Fancy \n\n\n\nBOOK FIFTEEN \n\nbothering about such trifles now\ And they \nactually say he is not honest and takes bribes. \nWhat nonsense! Besides, why shouldn't he take \nbribes? That's the way he was brought up, and \neverybody does it. But what a kind, pleasant \nface and how he smiles as he looks at me." \n\nPierre went to Princess Mary's to dinner. \n\nAs he drove through the streets past the \nhouses that had been burned down, he was \nsurprised by the beauty of those ruins. The \npicturesqueness of the chimney stacks and tum- \nble-down walls of the burned-out quarters of \nthe town, stretching out and concealing one \nanother, reminded him of the Rhine and the \nColosseum. The cabmen he met and their pas- \nsengers, the carpenters cutting the timber for \nnew houses with their axes, the women hawk- \ners, and the shopkeepers, all looked at him with \ncheerful beaming eyes that seemed to say: "Ah, \nthere he is! Let's see what will come of it!" \n\nAt the entrance to Princess Mary's house \nPierre felt doubtful whether he had really \nbeen there the night before and had really seen \nNatdsha and talked to her. "Perhaps I imagined \nit; perhaps I shall go in and find no one there." \nBut he had hardly entered the room before he \nfelt her presence with his whole being by the \nloss of his sense of freedom. She was in the \nsame black dress with soft folds and her hair \nwas done the same way as the day before, yet \nshe was quite different. Had she been like this \nwhen he entered the day before he could not \nfor a moment have failed to recognize her. \n\nShe was as he had known her almost as a \nchild and later on as Prince Andrew's fiancee. \nA bright questioning light shone in her eyes, \nand on her face was a friendly and strangely \nroguish expression. \n\nPierre dined with them and would have \nspent the whole evening there, but Princess \nMary was going to vespers and Pierre left the \nhouse with her. \n\nNext day he came early, dined, and stayed \nthe whole evening. Though Princess Mary and \nNatasha were evidently glad to see their visitor \nand though all Pierre's interest was now cen- \ntered in that house, by the evening they had \ntalked over everything and the conversation \npassed from one trivial topic to another and \nrepeatedly broke off. He stayed so long that \nPrincess Mary and Natdsha exchanged glances, \nevidently wondering when he would go. Pierre \nnoticed this but could not go. He felt uneasy \nand embarrassed, but sat on because he simply \ncould not get up and take his leave. \n\nPrincess Mary, foreseeing no end to this, \n\n\n\n641 \n\nrose first, and complaining of a headache be- \ngan to say good night. \n\n"So you are going to Petersburg tomorrow?" \nshe asked. \n\n"No, I am not going," Pierre replied hastily, \nin a surprised tone and as though offended. \n"Yes ... no ... to Petersburg? Tomorrow \nbut I won't say good-by yet. I will call round \nin case you have any commissions for me," \nsaid he, standing before Princess Mary and \nturning red, but not taking his departure. \n\nNatasha gave him her hand and went out. \nPrincess Mary on the other hand instead of go- \ning away sank into an armchair, and looked \nsternly and intently at him with her deep, ra- \ndiant eyes. The weariness she had plainly \nshown before had now quite passed off. With a \ndeep and long-drawn sigh she seemed to be pre- \npared for a lengthy talk. \n\nWhen Natdsha left the room Pierre's confu- \nsion and awkwardness immediately vanished \nand were replaced by eager excitement. He \nquickly moved an armchair toward Princess \nMary. \n\n"Yes, I wanted to tell you," said he, answer- \ning her look as if she had spoken. "Princess, \nhelp me! What am I to do? Can I hope? Prin- \ncess, my dear friend, listenl I know it all. I \nknow I am not worthy of her, I know it's im- \npossible to speak of it now. But I want to be a \nbrother to her. No, not that, I don't, I can't . . ." \n\nHe paused and rubbed his face and eyes \nwith his hands. \n\n"Well," he went on with an evident effort \nat self-control and coherence. "I don't know \nwhen I began to love her, but I have loved her \nand her alone all my life, and I love her so that \nI cannot imagine life without her. I cannot \npropose to her at present, but the thought that \nperhaps she might someday be my wife and \nthat I may be missing that possibility . . . that \npossibility ... is terrible. Tell me, can I hope? \nTell me what I am to do, dear princess!" he \nadded after a pause, and touched her hand as \nshe did not reply. \n\n"I am thinking of what you have told me," \nanswered Princess Mary. "This is what I will \nsay. You are right that to speak to her of love \nat present . . ." \n\nPrincess Mary stopped. She was going to say \nthat to speak of love was impossible, but she \nstopped because she had seen by the sudden \nchange in Natdsha two days before that she \nwould not only not be hurt if Pierre spoke of \nhis love, but that it was the very thing she \nwished for. \n\n\n\n648 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\n"To speak to her now wouldn't do," said the \nprincess all the same. \n\n"But what am I to do?" \n\n"Leave it to me," said Princess Mary. "I \nknow . . ." \n\nPierre was looking into Princess Mary's eyes. \n\n"Well? . . . Well? . . ." he said. \n\n"I know that she loves . . . will love you," \nPrincess Mary corrected herself. \n\nBefore her words were out, Pierre had sprung \nup and with a frightened expression seized \nPrincess Mary's hand. \n\n"What makes you think so? You think I may \nhope? You think . . . ?" \n\n"Yes, I think so," said Princess Mary with a \nsmile. "Write to her parents, and leave it to \nme. 1 will tell her when I can. I wish it to hap- \npen and my heart tells me it will." \n\n"No, it cannot be I How happy I am! But it \ncan't be. . . . How happy I am! No, it can't \nbe!" Pierre kept saying as he kissed Princess \nMary's hands. \n\n"Go to Petersburg, that will be best. And I \nwill write to you," she said. \n\n"To Petersburg? Go there? Very well, I'll go. \nBut I may come again tomorrow?" \n\nNext day Pierre came to say good-by. Natisha \nwas less animated than she had been the day \nbefore; but that day as he looked at her Pierre \nsometimes felt as if he was vanishing and that \nneither he nor she existed any longer, that \nnothing existed but happiness. "Is it possible? \nNo, it can't be," he told himself at every look, \ngesture, and word that filled his soul with \njoy. \n\nWhen on saying good-by he took her thin, \nslender hand, he could not help holding it a \nlittle longer in his own. \n\n"Is it possible that this hand, that face, those \neyes, all this treasure of feminine charm so \nstrange to me now, is it possible that it will \none day be mine forever, as familiar to me as \nI am to myself? . . . No, that's impossible! . . ." \n\n"Good-by, Count," she said aloud. "I shall \nlook forward very much to your return," she \nadded in a whisper. \n\nAnd these simple words, her look, and the \nexpression on her face which accompanied \nthem, formed for two months the subject of in- \nexhaustible memories, interpretations, and \nhappy meditations for Pierre. " 'I shall look \n\nforward very much to your return ' Yes, yes, \n\nhow did she say it? Yes, 'I shall look forward \nvery much to your return.' Oh, how happy I \nam! What is happening to me? How happy I \nami" said Pierre to himself. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX \n\nTHERE WAS NOTHING in Pierre's soul now at all \nlike what had troubled it during his courtship \nof H&amp;fcne. \n\nHe did not repeat to himself with a sicken- \ning feeling of shame the words he had spoken, \nor say: "Oh, why did I not say that?" and, \n"Whatever made me say 'Je vous aime'?" On \nthe contrary, he now repeated in imagination \nevery word that he or Natdsha had spoken and \npictured every detail of her face and smile, \nand did not wish to diminish or add anything, \nbut only to repeat it again and again. There \nwas now not a shadow of doubt in his mind as \nto whether what he had undertaken was right \nor wrong. Only one terrible doubt sometimes \ncrossed his mind: "Wasn't it all a dream? Isn't \nPrincess Mary mistaken? Am I not too con- \nceited and self-confident? I believe all this \nand suddenly Princess Mary will tell her, and \nshe will be sure to smile and say: 'How strange! \nHe must be deluding himself. Doesn't he know \nthat he is a man, just a man, while I . . . ? I am \nsomething altogether different and higher.' " \n\nThat was the only doubt often troubling \nPierre. He did not now make any plans. The \nhappiness before him appeared so inconceiv- \nable that if only he could attain it, it would be \nthe end of all things. Everything ended with \nthat. \n\nA joyful, unexpected frenzy, of which he had \nthought himself incapable, possessed him. The \nwhole meaning of lifenot for him alone but \nfor the whole world seemed to him centered \nin his love and the possibility of being loved \nby her. At times everybody seemed to him to \nbe occupied with one thing only his future \nhappiness. Sometimes it seemed to him that \nother people were all as pleased as he was him- \nself and merely tried to hide that pleasure by \npretending to be busy with other interests. In \nevery word and gesture he saw allusions to his \nhappiness. He often surprised those he met by \nhis significantly happy looks and smiles which \nseemed to express a secret understanding be- \ntween him and them. And when he realized \nthat people might not be aware of his happi- \nness, he pitied them with his whole heart and \nfelt a desire somehow to explain to them that \nall that occupied them was a mere frivolous \ntrifle unworthy of attention. \n\nWhen it was suggested to him that he should \nenter the civil service, or when the war or any \ngeneral political affairs were discussed on the \nassumption that everybody's welfare depended \non this or that issue of events, he would listen \n\n\n\nBOOK FIFTEEN \n\n\n\n64S \n\n\n\nwith a mild and pitying smile and surprise \npeople by his strange comments. But at this \ntime he saw everybody both those who, as \nhe imagined, understood the real meaning of \nlife (that is, what he was feeling) and those \nunfortunates who evidently did not under- \nstand it in the bright light of the emotion that \nshone within himself, and at once without any \neffort saw in everyone he met everything that \nwas good and worthy of being loved. \n\nWhen dealing with the affairs and papers \nof his dead wife, her memory aroused in him \nno feeling but pity that she had not known the \nbliss he now knew. Prince Vasili, who having \nobtained a new post and some fresh decora- \ntions was particularly proud at this time, \nseemed to him a pathetic, kindly old man much \nto be pitied. \n\nOften in afterlife Pierre recalled this period \nof blissful insanity. All the views he formed \nof men and circumstances at this time re- \nmained true for him always. He not only did \nnot renounce them subsequently, but when he \nwas in doubt or inwardly at variance, he re- \nferred to the views he had held at this time of \nhis madness and they always proved correct. \n\n"I may have appeared strange and queer \nthen," he thought, "but I was not so mad as I \nseemed. On the contrary 1 was then wiser and \nhad more insight than at any other time, and \nunderstood all that is worth understanding \nin life, because . . . because I was happy." \n\nPierre's insanity consisted in not waiting, as \nhe used to do, to discover personal attributes \nwhich he termed "good qualities" in people \nbefore loving them; his heart was now over- \nflowing with love, and by loving people with- \nout cause he discovered indubitable causes for \nloving them. \n\nCHAPTER XX \n\nAFTER PIERRE'S DEPARTURE that first evening, \nwhen Natdsha had said to Princess Mary with \na gaily mocking smile: "He looks just, yes, just \nas if he had come out of a Russian bath in a \nshort coat and with his hair cropped," some- \nthing hidden and unknown to herself, but \nirrepressible, awoke in Natdsha's soul. \n\nEverything: her face, walk, look, and voice, \nwas suddenly altered. To her own surprise a \npower of life and hope of happiness rose to \nthe surface and demanded satisfaction. From \nthat evening she seemed to have forgotten all \nthat had happened to her. She no longer com- \nplained of her position, did not say a word \nabout the past, and no longer feared to make \n\n\n\nhappy plans for the future. She spoke little of \nPierre, but when Princess Mary mentioned \nhim a long-extinguished light once more kin- \ndled in her eyes and her lips curved with a \nstrange smile. \n\nThe change that took place in Natasha at \nfirst surprised Princess Mary; but when she \nunderstood its meaning it grieved her. "Can \nshe have loved my brother so little as to be \nable to forget him so soon?" she thought when \nshe reflected on the change. But when she was \nwith Natdsha she was not vexed with her and \ndid not reproach her. The reawakened power \nof life that had seized Natasha was so evidently \nirrepressible and unexpected by her that in \nher presence Princess Mary felt that she had \nno right to reproach her even in her heart. \n\nNatasha gave herself up so fully and frankly \nto this new feeling that she did not try to hide \nthe fact that she was no longer sad, but bright \nand cheerful. \n\nWhen Princess Mary returned to her room \nafter her nocturnal talk with Pierre, Natdsha \nmet her on the threshold. \n\n"He has spoken? Yes? He has spoken?" she \nrepeated. \n\nAnd a joyful yet pathetic expression which \nseemed to beg forgiveness for her joy settled \non Natdsha's face. \n\n"1 wanted to listen at the door, but I knew \nyou would tell me." \n\nUnderstandable and touching as the look \nwith which Natasha gazed at her seemed to \nPrincess Mary, and sorry as she was to see her \nagitation, these words pained her for a mo- \nment. She remembered her brother and his \nlove. \n\n"But what's to be done? She can't help it," \nthought the princess. \n\nAnd with a sad and rather stern look she \ntold Natdsha all that Pierre had said. On hear- \ning that he was going to Petersburg Natdsha \nwas astounded. \n\n"To Petersburgl" she repeated as if unable \nto understand. \n\nBut noticing the grieved expression on Prin- \ncess Mary's face she guessed the reason of that \nsadness and suddenly began to cry. \n\n"Mary," said she, "tell me what I should dol \nI am afraid of being bad. Whatever you tell \nme, I will do. Tell me " \n\n"You love him?" \n\n"Yes," whispered Natdsha. \n\n"Then why are you crying?

The storm- tossed sea \nof European history had subsided within its \nshores and seemed to have become calm. But \nthe mysterious forces that move humanity (mys- \nterious because the laws of their motion are un- \nknown to us) continued to operate. \n\nThough the surface of the sea of history \nseemed motionless, the movement of humanity \nwent on as unceasingly as the flow of time. Var- \nious groups of people formed and dissolved, \nthe coming formation and dissolution of king- \ndoms and displacement of peoples was in \ncourse of preparation. \n\nThe sea of history was not driven spasmodi- \ncally from shore to shore as previously. It was \nseething in its depths. Historic figures were not \nborne by the waves from one shore to another \nas before. They now seemed to rotate on one \nspot. The historical figures at the head of ar- \nmies, who formerly reflected the movement of \nthe masses by ordering wars, campaigns, and \nbattles, now reflected the restless movement \nby political and diplomatic combinations, laws, \nand treaties. \n\nThe historians call this activity of the histor- \nical figures "the reaction." \n\nIn dealing with this period they sternly con- \ndemn the historical personages who, in their \nopinion, caused what they describe as the re- \naction. All the well-known people of that pe- \nriod, from Alexander and Napoleon to Ma- \ndame de Stael, Photius, Schelling, Fichte, Cha- \nteaubriand, and the rest, pass before their \nstern judgment seat and are acquitted or con- \ndemned according to whether they conduced \nto progress or to reaction. \n\nAccording to their accounts a reaction took \nplace at that time in Russia also, and the chief \nculprit was Alexander I, the same man who ac- \ncording to them was the chief cause of the lib- \neral movement at the commencement of his \nreign, being the savior of Russia. \n\nThere is no one in Russian literature now, \nfrom schoolboy essayist to learned historian, \n\n\n\nwho does not throw his little stone at Alexan- \nder for things he did wrong at this period of \nhis reign. \n\n"He ought to have acted in this way and in \nthat way. In this case he did well and in that \ncase badly. He behaved admirably at the be- \nginning of his reign and during 1812, but act- \ned badly by giving a constitution to Poland, \nforming the Holy Alliance, entrusting power \nto Arakche"ev, favoring GoHtsyn and mysticism, \nand afterwards Shishk6v and Photius. He also \nacted badly by concerning himself with the ac- \ntive army and disbanding the Semenov regi- \nment." \n\nIt would take a dozen pages to enumerate \nall the reproaches the historians address to \nhim, based on their knowledge of what is good \nfor humanity. \n\nWhat do these reproaches mean? \n\nDo not the very actions for which the histo- \nrians praise Alexander I (the liberal attempts \nat the beginning of his reign, his struggle with \nNapoleon, the firmness he displayed in 1812 \nand the campaign of 1813) flow from the same \nsourcesthe circumstances of his birth, educa- \ntion, and lifethat made his personality what \nit was and from which the actions for which \nthey blame him (the Holy Alliance, the resto- \nration of Poland, and the reaction of 1820 and \nlater) also flowed? \n\nIn what does the substance of those reproach- \nes lie? \n\nIt lies in the fact that an historic character \nlike Alexander I, standing on the highest pos- \nsible pinnacle of human power with the blind- \ning light of history focused upon him; a char- \nacter exposed to those strongest of all influ- \nences: the intrigues, flattery, and self-deception \ninseparable from power; a character who at \nevery moment of his life felt a responsibility \nfor all that was happening in Europe; and not \na fictitious but a live character who like every \nman had his personal habits, passions, and im- \npulses toward goodness, beauty, and truth \nthat this character though not lacking in vir- \n\n\n\n645 \n\n\n\n646 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\ntue (the historians do not accuse him of that) \nhad not the same conception of the welfare \nof humanity fifty years ago * as a present-day \nprofessor who from his youth upwards has \nbeen occupied with learning: that is, with \nbooks and lectures and with taking notes from \nthem. \n\nBut even if we assume that fifty years ago \nAlexander I was mistaken in his view of what \nwas good for the people, we must inevitably \nassume that the historian who judges Alexan- \nder will also after the lapse of some time turn \nout to be mistaken in his view of what is good \nfor humanity. This assumption is all the more \nnatural and inevitable because, watching the \nmovement of history, we sec that every year \nand with each new writer, opinion as to what \nis good for mankind changes; so that what \nonce seemed good, ten years later seems bad, \nand vice versa. And what is more, we find at \none and the same time quite contradictory \nviews as to what is bad and what is good in his- \ntory: some people regard giving a constitu- \ntion to Poland and forming the Holy Alliance \nas praiseworthy in Alexander, while others re- \ngard it as blameworthy. \n\nThe activity of Alexander or of Napoleon \ncannot be called useful or harmful, for it is \nimpossible to say for what it was useful or \nharmful. If that activity displeases somebody, \nthis is only because it does not agree with his \nlimited understanding of what is good. Wheth- \ner the preservation of my father's house in \nMoscow, or the glory of the Russian arms, or \nthe prosperity of the Petersburg and other uni- \nversities, or the freedom of Poland or the great- \nness of Russia, or the balance of power in Eu- \nrope, or a certain kind of European culture \ncalled "progress" appear to me to be good or \nbad, I must admit that besides these things the \naction of every historic character has other \nmore general purposes inaccessible to me. \n\nBut let us assume that what is called science \ncan harmonize all contradictions and possesses \nan unchanging standard of good and bad by \nwhich to try historic characters and events; let \nus say that Alexander could have done every- \nthing differently; let us say that with guidance \nfrom those who blame him and who profess to \nknow the ultimate aim of the movement of hu- \nmanity, he might have arranged matters ac- \ncording to the program his present accusers \nwould have given him of nationality, freedom, \nequality, and progress (these, I think, cover the \nground). Let us assume that this program was \n\n1 War and Peace was completed in 1869. TR. \n\n\n\npossible and had then been formulated, and \nthat Alexander had acted on it. What would \nthen have become of the activity of all those \nwho opposed the tendency that then prevailed \nin the governmentan activity that in the \nopinion of the historians was good and benefi- \ncent? Their activity would not have existed: \nthere would have been no life, there would \nhave been nothing. \n\nIf we admit that human life can be ruled by \nreason, the possibility of life is destroyed. \n\nCHAPTER II \n\nIF WE ASSUME as the historians do that great \nmen lead humanity to the attainment of cer- \ntain ends the greatness of Russia or of France, \nthe balance of power in Europe, the diffusion \nof the ideas of the Revolution, general prog- \nress, or anything else then it is impossible \nto explain the facts of history without intro- \nducing the conceptions of chance and genius. \n\nIf the aim of the European wars at the be- \nginning of the nineteenth century had been \nthe aggrandizement of Russia, that aim might \nhave been accomplished without all the pre- \nceding wars and without the invasion. If the \naim was the aggrandizement of France, that \nmight have been attained without the Revolu- \ntion and without the Empire. If the aim was \nthe dissemination of ideas, the printing press \ncould have accomplished that much better \nthan warfare. If the aim was the progress of \ncivilization, it is easy to sec that there are other \nways of diffusing civilization more expedient \nthan by the destruction of wealth and of hu- \nman lives. \n\nWhy did it happen in this and not in some \nother way? \n\nBecause it happened so! "Chance created the \nsituation; genius utilized it," says history. \n\nBut what is chance? What is genius? \n\nThe words chance and genius do not denote \nany really existing thing and therefore can- \nnot be defined. Those words only denote a \ncertain stage of understanding of phenomena. \nI do not know why a certain event occurs; I \nthink that I cannot know it; so I do not try to \nknow it and I talk about chance. I see a force \nproducing effects beyond the scope of ordinary \nhuman agencies; I do not understand why this \noccurs and I talk of genius. \n\nTo a herd of rams, the ram the herdsman \ndrives each evening into a special enclosure \nto feed and that becomes twice as fat as the \nothers must seem to be a genius. And it must \nappear an astonishing conjunction of genius \n\n\n\nFIRST EPILOGUE \n\n\n\n647 \n\n\n\nwith a whole series of extraordinary chances \nthat this ram, who instead of getting into the \ngeneral fold every evening goes into a special \nenclosure where there are oatsthat this very \nram, swelling with fat, is killed for meat. \n\nBut the rams need only cease to suppose that \nall that happens to them happens solely for \nthe attainment of their sheepish aims; they \nneed only admit that what happens to them \nmay also have purposes beyond their ken, and \nthey will at once perceive a unity and coher- \nence in what happened to the ram that was \nfattened. Even if they do not know for what \npurpose they are fattened, they will at least \nknow that all that happened to the ram did \nnot happen accidentally, and will no longer \nneed the conceptions of chance or genius. \n\nOnly by renouncing our claim to discern a \npurpose immediately intelligible to us, and ad- \nmitting the ultimate purpose to be beyond \nour ken, may we discern the sequence of ex- \nperiences in the lives of historic characters and \nperceive the cause of the effect they produce \n(incommensurable with ordinary human capa- \nbilities), and then the words chance and genius \nbecome superfluous. \n\nWe need only confess that we do not know \nthe purpose of the European convulsions and \nthat we know only the facts that is, the mur- \nders, first in France, then in Italy, in Africa, in \nPrussia, in Austria, in Spain, and in Russia \nand that the movements from the west to the \neast and from the east to the west form the es- \nsence and purpose of these events, and not \nonly shall we have no need to see exceptional \nability and genius in Napoleon and Alexander, \nbut we shall be unable to consider them to be \nanything but like other men, and we shall not \nbe obliged to have recourse to chance for an \nexplanation of those small events which made \nthese people what they were, but it will be \nclear that all those small events were inevita- \nble. \n\nBy discarding a claim to knowledge of the \nultimate purpose, we shall clearly perceive \nthat just as one cannot imagine a blossom or \nseed for any single plant better suited to it than \nthose it produces, so it is impossible to imagine \nany two people more completely adapted down \nto the smallest detail for the purpose they had \nto fulfill, than Napoleon and Alexander with \nall their antecedents. \n\nCHAPTER III \n\nTHE FUNDAMENTAL and essential significance \nof the European events of the beginning of the \n\n\n\nnineteenth century lies in the movement of \nthe mass of the European peoples from west \nto east and afterwards from east to west. The \ncommencement of that movement was the \nmovement from west to east. For the peoples of \nthe west to be able to make their warlike move- \nment to Moscow it was necessary: (i) that they \nshould form themselves into a military group \nof a size able to endure a collision with the \nwarlike military group of the east, (2) that \nthey should abandon all established traditions \nand customs, and (3) that during their military \nmovement they should have at their head a \nman who could justify to himself and to them \nthe deceptions, robberies, and murders which \nwould have to be committed during that move- \nment. \n\nAnd beginning with the French Revolution \nthe old inadequately large group was destroyed, \nas well as the old habits and traditions, and \nstep by step a group was formed of larger di- \nmensions with new customs and traditions, \nand a man was produced who would stand at \nthe head of the coming movement and bear \nthe responsibility for all that had to be done. \n\nA man without convictions, without habits, \nwithout traditions, without a name, and not \neven a Frenchman, emerges by what seem \nthe strangest chances from among all the \nseething French parties, and without joining \nany one of them is borne forward to a promi- \nnent position. \n\nThe ignorance of his colleagues, the weak- \nness and insignificance of his opponents, the \nfrankness of his falsehoods, and the dazzling \nand self-confident limitations of this man raise \nhim to the head of the army. The brilliant \nqualities of the soldiers of the army sent to \nItaly, his opponents' reluctance to fight, and \nhis own childish audacity and self-confidence \nsecure him military fame. Innumerable so- \ncalled chances accompany him everywhere. \nThe disfavor into which he falls with the rul- \ners of France turns to his advantage. His at- \ntempts to avoid his predestined path are un- \nsuccessful: he is not received into the Russian \nservice, and the appointment he seeks in Tur- . \nkey comes to nothing. During the war in Italy \nhe is several times on the verge of destruction \nand each time is saved in an unexpected man- \nner. Owing to various diplomatic considera- \ntions the Russian armies just those which \nmight have destroyed his prestige do not ap- \npear upon the scene till he is no longer there. \n\nOn his return from Italy he finds the gov- \nernment in Paris in a process of dissolution in \n\n\n\n648 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nwhich all those who are in it are inevitably \nwiped out and destroyed. And by chance an \nescape from this dangerous position presents \nitself in the form of an aimless and senseless \nexpedition to Africa. Again so-called chance \naccompanies him. Impregnable Malta surren- \nders without a shot; his most reckless schemes \nare crowned with success. The enemy's fleet, \nwhich subsequently did not let a single boat \npass, allows his entire army to elude it. In \nAfrica a whole series of outrages are commit- \nted against the almost unarmed inhabitants. \nAnd the men who commit these crimes, es- \npecially their leader, assure themselves that \nthis is admirable, this is glory it resembles \nCaesar and Alexander the Great and is there- \nfore good. \n\nThis ideal of glory and grandeur which \nconsists not merely in considering nothing \nwrong that one does but in priding oneself on \nevery crime one commits, ascribing to it an in- \ncomprehensible supernatural significance \nthat ideal, destined to guide this man and his \nassociates, had scope for its development in \nAfrica. Whatever he does succeeds. The plague \ndoes not touch him. The cruelty of murdering \nprisoners is not imputed to him as a fault. His \nchildishly rash, uncalled-for, and ignoble de- \nparture from Africa, leaving his comrades in \ndistress, is set down to his credit, and again the \nenemy's fleet twice lets him slip past. When, \nintoxicated by the crimes he has committed so \nsuccessfully, he reaches Paris, the dissolution \nof the republican government, which a year \nearlier might have ruined him, has reached its \nextreme limit, and his presence there now as a \nnewcomer free from party entanglements can \nonly serve to exalt him and though he him- \nself has no plan, he is quite ready for his new \nr61e. \n\nHe had no plan, he was afraid of everything, \nbut the parties snatched at him and demanded \nhis participation. \n\nHe alone with his ideal of glory and gran- \ndeur developed in Italy and Egypt, his insane \nself-adulation, his boldness in crime and frank- \nness in lyinghe alone could justify what had \nto be done. \n\nHe is needed for the place that awaits him, \nand so almost apart from his will and despite \nhis indecision, his lack of a plan, and all his \nmistakes, he is drawn into a conspiracy that \naims at seizing power and the conspiracy is \ncrowned with success. \n\nHe is pushed into a meeting of the legisla- \nture. In alarm he wishes to flee, considering \n\n\n\nhimself lost. He pretends to fall into a swoon \nand says senseless things that should have \nruined him. But the once proud and shrewd \nrulers of France, feeling that their part is \nplayed out, are even more bewildered than he, \nand do not say the words they should have said \nto destroy him and retain their power. \n\nChance f millions of chances, give him power, \nand all men as if by agreement co-operate to \nconfirm that power. Chance forms the charac- \nters of the rulers of France, who submit to him; \nchance forms the character of Paul I of Russia \nwho recognizes his government; chance con- \ntrives a plot against him which not only fails \nto harm him but confirms his power. Chance \nputs the Due d'Enghien in his hands and un- \nexpectedly causes him to kill him thereby con- \nvincing the mob more forcibly than in any \nother way that he had the right, since he had \nthe might. Chance contrives that though he \ndirects all his efforts to prepare an expedition \nagainst England (which would inevitably have \nruined him) he never carries out that inten- \ntion, but unexpectedly falls upon Mack and \nthe Austrians, who surrender without a battle. \nChance and genius give him the victory at \nAusterlitz; and by chance all men, not only the \nFrench but all Europe except England which \ndoes not take part in the events about to hap- \npendespite their former horror and detesta- \ntion of his crimes, now recognize his authority, \nthe title he has given himself, and his ideal of \ngrandeur and glory, which seems excellentand \nreasonable to them all. \n\nAs if measuring themselves and preparing \nfor the coming movement, the western forces \npush toward the east several times in 1805, \n1806, 1807, and 1809, gaining strength and \ngrowing. In 1811 the group of people that had \nformed in France unites into one group with \nthe peoples of Central Europe. The strength \nof the justification of the man who stands at \nthe head of the movement grows with the in- \ncreased size of the group. During the ten-year \npreparatory period this man had formed rela- \ntions with all the crowned heads of Europe. \nThe discredited rulers of the world can op- \npose no reasonable ideal to the insensate Na- \npoleonic ideal of glory and grandeur. One aft- \ner another they hasten to display their insig- \nnificance before him. The King of Prussia \nsends his wife to seek the great man's mercy; \nthe Emperor of Austria considers it a favor \nthat this man receives a daughter of the Caesars \ninto his bed; the Pope, the guardian of all that \nthe nations hold sacred, utilizes religion for \n\n\n\nFIRST EPILOGUE \n\nthe aggrandizement of the great man. It is not \nNapoleon who prepares himself for the accom- \nplishment of his role, so much as all those \nround him who prepare him to take on him- \nself the whole responsibility for what is hap- \npening and has to happen. There is no step, \nno crime or petty fraud he commits, which in \nthe mouths of those around him is not at once \nrepresented as a great deed. The most suitable \nfete the Germans can devise for him is a cele- \nbration of Jena and Auerstadt. Not only is he \ngreat, but so are his ancestors, his brothers, his \nstepsons, and his brothers-in-law. Everything \nis done to deprive him of the remains of his \nreason and to prepare him for his terrible \npart. And when he is ready so too are the forces. \n\nThe invasion pushes eastward and reaches \nits final goalMoscow. That city is taken; the \nRussian army suffers heavier losses than the \nopposing armies had suffered in the former war \nfrom Austerlitz to Wagram. But suddenly in- \nstead of those chances and that genius which \nhitherto had so consistently led him by an un- \ninterrupted series of successes to the predes- \ntined goal, an innumerable sequence of inverse \nchances occur from the cold in his head at \nBorodin6 to the sparks which set Moscow on \nfire, and the frosts and instead of genius, stu- \npidity and immeasurable baseness become evi- \ndent. \n\nThe invaders flee, turn back, flee again, and \nall the chances are now not for Napoleon but \nalways against him. \n\nA countermovement is then accomplished \nfrom east to west with a remarkable resem- \nblance to the preceding movement from west \nto east. Attempted drives from east to west- \nsimilar to the contrary movements of 1805, \n1807, and 1809 precede the great westward \nmovement; there is the same coalescence into \na group of enormous dimensions; the same \nadhesion of the people of Central Europe to \nthe movement; the same hesitation midway, \nand the same increasing rapidity as the goal is \napproached. \n\nParis, the ultimate goal, is reached. The Na- \npoleonic government and army are destroyed. \nNapoleon himself is no longer of any account; \nall his actions are evidently pitiful and mean, \nbut again an inexplicable chance occurs. The \nallies detest Napoleon whom they regard as \nthe cause of their sufferings. Deprived of pow- \ner and authority, his crimes and his craft ex- \nposed, he should have appeared to them what \nhe appeared ten years previously and one year \nlateran outlawed brigand. But by some \n\n\n\n649 \n\nstrange chance no one perceives this. His part \nis not yet ended. The man who ten years be- \nfore and a year later was considered an out- \nlawed brigand is sent to an island two days' \nsail from France, which for some reason is pre- \nsented to him as his dominion, and guards are \ngiven to him and millions of money are paid \nhim. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV \n\nTHE FLOOD OF NATIONS begins to subside into \nits normal channels. The waves of the great \nmovement abate, and on the calm surface ed- \ndies are formed in which float the diplomatists, \nwho imagine that they have caused the floods \nto abate. \n\nBut the smooth sea again suddenly becomes \ndisturbed. The diplomatists think that their \ndisagreements are the cause of this fresh pres- \nsure of natural forces; they anticipate war be- \ntween their sovereigns; the position seems to \nthem insoluble. But the wave they feel to be \nrising does not come from the quarter they \nexpect. It rises again from the same point as \nbefore Paris. The last backwash of the move- \nment from the west occurs: a backwash which \nserves to solve the apparently insuperable dip- \nlomatic difficulties and ends the military move- \nment of that period of history. \n\nThe man who had devastated France returns \nto France alone, without any conspiracy and' \nwithout soldiers. Any guard might arrest him, \nbut by a strange chance no one does so and all \nrapturously greet the man they cursed the day \nbefore and will curse again a month later. \n\nThis man is still needed to justify the final \ncollective act. \n\nThat act is performed. \n\nThe last role is played. The actor is bidden \nto disrobe and wash off his powder and paint: \nhe will not be wanted any more. \n\nAnd some years pass during which he plays \na pitiful comedy to himself in solitude on his \nisland, justifying his actions by intrigues and \nlies when the justification is no longer needed, \nand displaying to the whole world what it was \nthat people had mistaken for strength as long \nas an unseen hand directed his actions. \n\nThe manager having brought the drama to \na close and stripped the actor shows him to us. \n\n"See what you believed in! This is he I Do \nyou now see that it was not he but I who \nmoved you?" \n\nBut dazed by the force of the movement, it \nwas long before people understood this. \n\nStill greater coherence and inevitability is \n\n\n\n650 WAR AND PEACE \n\nseen in the life of Alexander I, the man who \nstood at the head of the countermovement \nfrom east to west. \n\nWhat was needed for him who, overshadow- \ning others, stood at the head of that movement \nfrom east to west? \n\nWhat was needed was a sense of justice and \na sympathy with European affairs, but a re- \nmote sympathy not dulled by petty interests; \na moral superiority over those sovereigns of \nthe day who co-operated with him; a mild and \nattractive personality; and a personal griev- \nance against Napoleon. And all this was found \nin Alexander I; all this had been prepared by \ninnumerable so-called chances in his life: his \neducation, his early liberalism, the advisers \nwho surrounded him, and by Austerlitz, and \nTilsit, and Erfurt. \n\nDuring the national war he was inactive be- \ncause he was not needed. But as soon as the \nnecessity for a general European war presented \nitself he appeared in his place at the given mo- \nment and, uniting the nations of Europe, led \nthem to the goal. \n\nThe goal is reached. After the final war of \n1815 Alexander possesses all possible power. \nHow does he use it? \n\nAlexander I the pacifier of Europe, the \nman who from his early years had striven only \nfor his people's welfare, the originator of the \nliberal innovations in his fatherland now that \nhe seemed to possess the utmost power and \ntherefore to have the possibility of bringing \nabout the welfare of his peoplesat the time \nwhen Napoleon in exile was drawing up child- \nish and mendacious plans of how he would \nhave made mankind happy had he retained \npower Alexander I, having fulfilled his mis- \nsion and feeling the hand of God upon him, \nsuddenly recognizes the insignificance of that \nsupposed power, turns away from it, and gives \nit into the hands of contemptible men whom \nhe despises, saying only: \n\n"Not unto us, not unto us, but unto Thy \nName! ... I too am a man like the rest of you. \nLet me live like a man and think of my soul \nand of God." \n\nAs the sun and each atom of ether is a sphere \ncomplete in itself, and yet at the same time \nonly a pan of a whole too immense for man to \ncomprehend, so each individual has within \nhimself his own aims and yet has them to serve \na general purpose incomprehensible to man. \n\nA bee settling on a flower has stung a child. \nAnd the child is afraid of bees and declares \nthat bees exist to sting people. A poet admires \n\n\n\nthe bee sucking from the chalice of a flower \nand says it exists to suck the fragrance of flow- \ners. A beekeeper, seeing the bee collect pollen \nfrom flowers and carry it to the hive, says that \nit exists to gather honey. Another beekeeper \nwho has studied the life of the hive more close- \nly says that the bee gathers pollen dust to feed \nthe young bees and rear a queen, and that it \nexists to perpetuate its race. A botanist notices \nthat the bee flying with the pollen'of a male \nflower to a pistil fertilizes the latter, and sees \nin this the purpose of the bee's existence. An- \nother, observing the migration of plants, no- \ntices that the bee helps in this work, and may \nsay that in this lies the purpose of the bee. But \nthe ultimate purpose of the bee is not exhaust- \ned by the first, the second, or any of the proc- \nesses the human mind can discern. The higher \nthe human intellect rises in the discovery of \nthese purposes, the more obvious it becomes \nthat the ultimate purpose is beyond our com- \nprehension. \n\nAll that is accessible to man is the relation \nof the life of the bee to other manifestations of \nlife. And so it is with the purpose of historic \ncharacters and nations. \n\nCHAPTER V \n\nNATASHA'S WEDDING to Bezukhov, which took \nplace in 1813, was the last happy event in the \nfamily of the old Rost6vs. Count Ilyd Rostov \ndied that same year and, as always happens, \nafter the father's death the family group broke \nup. \n\nThe events of the previous year: the burn- \ning of Moscow and the flight from it, the death \nof Prince Andrew, Natasha's despair, P^tya's \ndeath, and the old countess' grief fell blow aft- \ner blow on the old count's head. He seemed to \nbe unable to understand the meaning of all \nthese events, and bowed his old head in a spir- \nitual sense as if expecting and inviting further \nblows which would finish him. He seemed now \nfrightened and distraught and now unnatural- \nly animated and enterprising. \n\nThe arrangements for Natasha's marriage \noccupied him for a while. He ordered dinners \nand suppers and obviously tried to appear \ncheerful, but his cheerfulness was not infec- \ntious as it used to be: on the contrary it evoked \nthe compassion of those who knew and liked \nhim. \n\nWhen Pierre and his wife had left, he grew \nvery quiet and began to complain of depres- \nsion. A few days later he fell ill and took to his \nbed. He realized from the first that he would \n\n\n\nFIRST EPILOGUE \n\n\n\n651 \n\n\n\nnot get up again, despite the doctor's encour- \nagement. The countess passed a fortnight in \nan armchair by his pillow without undressing. \nEvery time she gave him his medicine he sobbed \nand silently kissed her hand. On his last day, \nsobbing, he asked her and his absent son to \nforgive him for having dissipated their prop- \nertythat being the chief fault of which he was \nconscious. After receiving communion and \nunction he quietly died; and next day a throng \nof acquaintances who came to pay their last \nrespects to the deceased filled the house rented \nby the Rostovs. All these acquaintances, who \nhad so often dined and danced at his house \nand had so often laughed at him, now said, \nwith a common feeling of self-reproach and \nemotion, as if justifying themselves: "Well, \nwhatever he may have been he was a most \nworthy man. You don't meet such men nowa- \ndays. . . .And which of us has not weaknesses \nof his own?" \n\nIt was just when the count's affairs had be- \ncome so involved that it was impossible to say \nwhat would happen if he lived another year \nthat he unexpectedly died. \n\nNicholas was with the Russian army in Paris \nwhen the news of his father's death reached \nhim. He at once resigned his commission, and \nwithout waiting for it to be accepted took leave \nof absence and went to Moscow. The state of \nthe count's affairs became quite obvious a \nmonth after his death, surprising everyone by \nthe immense total of small debts the existence \nof which no one had suspected. The debts \namounted to double the value of the property. \n\nFriends and relations advised Nicholas to \ndecline the inheritance. But he regarded such \na refusal as a slur on his father's memory, \nwhich he held sacred, and therefore would not \nhear of refusing and accepted the inheritance \ntogether with the obligation to pay the debts. \n\nThe creditors who had so long been silent, \nrestrained by a vague but powerful influence \nexerted on them while he lived by the count's \ncareless good nature, all proceeded to enforce \ntheir claims at once. As always happens in \nsuch cases rivalry sprang up as to which should \nget paid first, and those who like Mitenka held \npromissory notes given them as presents now \nbecame the most exacting of the creditors. \nNicholas was allowed no respite and no peace, \nand those who had seemed to pity the old man \nthe cause of their losses (if they were losses) \nnow remorselessly pursued the young heir \nwho had voluntarily undertaken the debts and \nwas obviously not guilty of contracting them. \n\n\n\nNot one of the plans Nicholas tried suc- \nceeded; the estate was sold by auction for half \nits value, and half the debts still remained un- \npaid. Nicholas accepted thirty thousand ru- \nbles offered him by his brother-in-law Beziik- \nhov to pay off debts he regarded as genuinely \ndue for value received. And to avoid being im- \nprisoned for the remainder, as the creditors \nthreatened, he re-entered the government serv- \nice. \n\nHe could not rejoin the army where he \nwould have been made colonel at the next va- \ncancy, for his mother now clung to him as her \none hold on life; and so despite his reluctance \nto remain in Moscow among people who had \nknown him before, and despite his abhorrence \nof the civil service, he accepted a post in Mos- \ncow in that service, doffed the uniform of \nwhich he was so fond, and moved with his \nmother and S6nya to a small house on the Sf- \nvtsev Vrazhek. 1 \n\nNatdsha and Pierre were living in Peters- \nburg at the time and had no clear idea of \nNicholas' circumstances. Having borrowed \nmoney from his brother-in-law, Nicholas tried \nto hide his wretched condition from him. His \nposition was the more difficult because with \nhis salary of twelve hundred rubles he had not \nonly to keep himself, his mother, and S6nya, \nbut had to shield his mother from knowledge \nof their poverty. The countess could not con- \nceive of life without the luxurious conditions \nshe had been used to from childhood and, un- \nable to realize how hard it was for her son, \nkept demanding now a carriage (which they \ndid not keep) to send for a friend, now some \nexpensive article of food for herself, or wine \nfor her son, or money to buy a present as a sur- \nprise for Natisha or S6nya, or for Nicholas \nhimself. \n\nS6nya kept house, attended on her aunt, \nread to her, put up with her whims and secret \nill-will, and helped Nicholas to conceal their \npoverty from the old countess. Nicholas felt \nhimself irredeemably indebted to Sonya for \nall she was doing for his mother and greatly \nadmired her patience and devotion, but tried \nto keep aloof from her. \n\nHe seemed in his heart to reproach her for \nbeing too perfect, and because there was noth- \ning to reproach her with. She had all that peo- \nple are valued for, but little that could have \nmade him love her. He felt that the more he \nvalued her the less he loved her. He had taken \nher at her word when she wrote giving him his \n\n1 A poor quarter of Moscow. TR. \n\n\n\n652 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nfreedom and now behaved as if all that had \npassed between them had been long forgotten \nand could never in any case be renewed. \n\nNicholas* position became worse and worse. \nThe idea of putting something aside out of his \nsalary proved a dream. Not only did he not \nsave anything, but to comply with his mother's \ndemands he even incurred some small debts. \nHe could see no way out of this situation. The \nidea of marrying some rich woman, which was \nsuggested to him by his female relations, was \nrepugnant to him. The other way out his \nmother's death never entered his head. He \nwished for nothing and hoped for nothing, \nand deep in his heart experienced a gloomy \nand stern satisfaction in an uncomplaining en- \ndurance of his position. He tried to avoid his \nold acquaintances with their commiseration \nand offensive offers of assistance; he avoided \nall distraction and recreation, and even at \nhome did nothing but play cards with his \nmother, pace silently up and down the room, \nand smoke one pipe after another. He seemed \ncarefully to cherish within himself the gloomy \nmood which alone enabled him to endure his \nposition. i \n\nCHAPTER VI \n\nAT THE BEGINNING of winter Princess Mary \ncame to Moscow. From reports current in town \nshe learned how the Rost6vswere situated, and \nhow "the son has sacrificed himself for his \nmother," as people were saying. \n\n"I never expected anything else of him," \nsaid Princess Mary to herself, feeling a joyous \nsense of her love for him. Remembering her \nfriendly relations with all the Rost6vs which \nhad made her almost a member of the family, \nshe thought it her duty to go to see them. But \nremembering her relations with Nicholas in \nVor6nezh she was shy about doing so. Making \na great effort she did however go to call on \nthem a few weeks after her arrival in Moscow. \n\nNicholas was the first to meet her, as the \ncountess' room could only be reached through \nhis. But instead of being greeted with pleasure \nas she had expected, at his first glance at her \nhis face assumed a cold, stiff, proud expression \nshe had not seen on it before. He inquired \nabout her health, led the way to his mother, \nand having sat there for five minutes left the \nroom. \n\nWhen the princess came out of the countess' \nroom Nicholas met her again, and with marked \nsolemnity and stiffness accompanied her to the \nanteroom. To her remarks about his mother's \n\n\n\nhealth he made no reply. "What's that to you? \nLeave me in peace," his looks seemed to say. \n\n"Why does she come prowling here? What \ndoes she want? I can't bear these ladies and all \nthese civilities!" said he aloud in S6nya's pres- \nence, evidently unable to repress his vexation, \nafter the princess' carriage had disappeared. \n\n"Oh, Nicholas, how can you talk like that?" \ncried S6nya, hardly able to conceal her delight. \n"She is so kind and Mamma is so fond of herl" \n\nNicholas did not reply and tried to avoid \nspeaking of the princess any more. But after \nher visit the old countess spoke of her several \ntimes a day. \n\nShe sang her praises, insisted that her son \nmust call on her, expressed a wish to see her \noften, but yet always became ill-humored when \nshe began to talk about her. \n\nNicholas tried to keep silence when his \nmother spoke of the princess, but his silence ir- \nritated her. \n\n"She is a very admirable and excellent young \nwoman," said she, "and you must go and call \non her. You would at least be seeing somebody, \nand I think it must be dull for you only seeing \nus." \n\n"But I don't in the least want to, Mamma." \n\n"You used to want to, and now you don't. \nReally I don't understand you, my dear. One \nday you are dull, and the next you refuse to \nsee anyone." \n\n"But I never said I was dull." \n\n"Why, you said yourself you don't want \neven to see her. She is a very admirable young \nwoman and you always liked her, but now \nsuddenly you have got some notion or other in \nyour head. You hide everything from me." \n\n"Not at all, Mamma." \n\n"If I were asking you to do something disa- \ngreeable now but I only ask you to return a \ncall. One would think mere politeness re- \nquired it. ... Well, I have asked you, and now \nI won't interfere any more since you have se- \ncrets from your mother." \n\n"Well, then, I'll go if you wish it." \n\n"It doesn't matter to me. I only wish it for \nyour sake." \n\nNicholas sighed, bit his mustache, and laid \nout the cards for a patience, trying to divert \nhis mother's attention to another topic. \n\nThe same conversation was repeated next \nday and the day after, and the day after that. \n\nAfter her visit to the Rost6vs and her unex- \npectedly chilly reception by Nicholas, Prin- \ncess Mary confessed to herself that she had \nbeen right in not wishing to be the first to call. \n\n\n\nFIRST EPILOGUE \n\n\n\n"I expected nothing else," she told herself, \ncalling her pride to her aid. "I have nothing to \ndo with him and I only wanted to see the old \nlady, who was always kind to me and to whom \nI am under many obligations." \n\nBut she could not pacify herself with these \nreflections; a feeling akin to remorse troubled \nher when she thought of her visit. Though she \nhad firmly resolved not to call on the Rost6vs \nagain and to forget the whole matter, she felt \nherself all the time in an awkward position. And \nwhen she asked herself what distressed her, she \nhad to admit that it was her relation to Rostov. \nHis cold, polite manner did not express his \nfeeling for her (she knew that) but it con- \ncealed something, and until she could discover \nwhat that something was, she felt that she \ncould not be at ease. \n\nOne day in midwinter when sitting in the \nschoolroom attending to her nephew's lessons, \nshe was informed that Rost6v had called. With \na firm resolution not to betray herself and not \nshow her agitation, she sent for Mademoiselle \nBourienne and went with her to the drawing \nroom. \n\nHer first glance at Nicholas* face told her \nthat he had only come to fulfill the demands \nof politeness, and she firmly resolved to main- \ntain the tone in which he addressed her. \n\nThey spoke of the countess* health, of their \nmutual friends, of the latest war news, and \nwhen the ten minutes required by propriety \nhad elapsed after which a visitor may rise, \nNicholas got up to say good-by. \n\nWith Mademoiselle Bourienne's help the \nprincess had maintained the conversation very \nwell, but at the very last moment, just when \nhe rose, she was so tired of talking of what did \nnot interest her, and her mind was so full of \nthe question why she alone was granted so lit- \ntle happiness in life, that in a fit of absent- \nmindedness she sat still, her luminous eyes \ngazing fixedly before her, not noticing that he \nhad risen. \n\nNicholas glanced at her and, wishing to ap- \npear not to notice her abstraction, made some \nremark to Mademoiselle Bourienne and then \nagain looked at the princess. She still sat mo- \ntionless with a look of suffering on her gentle \nface. He suddenly felt sorry for her and was \nvaguely conscious that he might be the cause \nof the sadness her face expressed. He wished to \nhelp her and say something pleasant, but could \nthink of nothing to say. \n\n"Good-by, Princess!" said he. \n\nShe started, flushed, and sighed deeply. \n\n\n\n653 \n\n\n\n"Oh, I beg your pardon/' she said as if wak- \ning up. "Are you going already, Count? Well \nthen, good-by! Oh, but the cushion for the \ncountess!" \n\n"Wait a moment, I'll fetch it," said Made- \nmoiselle Bourienne, and she left the room. \n\nThey both sat silent, with an occasional \nglance at one another. \n\n"Yes, Princess," said Nicholas at last with a \nsad smile, "it doesn't seem long ago since we \nfirst met at Boguchdrovo, but how much water \nhas flowed since then! In what distress we all \nseemed to be then, yet I would give much to \nbring back that time . . . but there's no bring- \ning it back." \n\nPrincess Mary gazed intently into his eyes \nwith her own luminous ones as he said this. \nShe seemed to be trying to fathom the hidden \nmeaning of his words which would explain his \nfeeling for her. \n\n"Yes, yes," said she, "but you have no reason \nto regret the past, Count. As I understand your \npresent life, I think you will always recall it \nwith satisfaction, because the self-sacrifice that \nfills it now . . ." \n\n"I cannot accept your praise," he interrupted \nher hurriedly. "On the contrary I continually \nreproach myself. . . . But this is not at all an \ninteresting or cheerful subject." \n\nHis face again resumed its former stiff and \ncold expression. But the princess had caught a \nglimpse of the man she had known and loved, \nand it was to him that she now spoke. \n\n"I thought you would allow me to tell you \nthis," she said. "I had come so near to you . . . \nand to all your family that I thought you would \nnot consider my sympathy misplaced, but I \nwas mistaken," and suddenly her voice trem- \nbled. "I don't know why," she continued, re- \ncovering herself, "but you used to be different, \nand . . ." \n\n"There are a thousand reasons why! 9 laying \nspecial emphasis on the why. "Thank you, \nPrincess," he added softly. "Sometimes it is \nhard." \n\n"So that's why! That's why!" a voice whis- \npered in Princess Mary's soul. "No, it was not \nonly that gay, kind, and frank look, not only \nthat handsome exterior, that I loved in him. I \ndivined his noble, resolute, self-sacrificing spirit \ntoo," she said to herself. "Yes, he is poor now \nand I am rich. . . . Yes, that's the only reason. \n. . . Yes, were it not for that . . ."And remem- \nbering his former tenderness, and looking now \nat his kind, sorrowful face, she suddenly un- \nderstood the cause of his coldness. \n\n\n\n654 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\n"But why, Count, why?" she almost cried, \nunconsciously moving closer to him. "Why? \nTell me. You must tell me!" \n\nHe was silent. \n\n"I don't understand your why, Count," she \ncontinued, "but it's hard for me ... I confess \nit. For some reason you wish to deprive me of \nour former friendship. And that hurts me." \nThere were tears in her eyes and in her voice. \n"I have had so little happiness in life that every \nloss is hard for me to bear. . . . Excuse me, \ngood-by!" and suddenly she began to cry and \nwas hurrying from the room. \n\n"Princess, for God's sake!" he exclaimed, try- \ning to stop her. "Princess!" \n\nShe turned round. For a few seconds they \ngazed silently into one another's eyes and \nwhat had seemed impossible and remote sud- \ndenly became possible, inevitable, and very \nnear. \n\nCHAPTER VII \n\nIN THE WINTER of 1813 Nicholas married Prin- \ncess Mary and moved to Bald Hills with his \nwife, his mother, and S6nya. \n\nWithin four years he had paid off all his re- \nmaining debts without selling any of his wife's \nproperty, and having received a small inherit- \nance on the death of a cousin he paid his debt \nto Pierre as well. \n\nIn another three years, by 1820, he had so \nmanaged his affairs that he was able to buy a \nsmall estate adjoining Bald Hills and was ne- \ngotiating to buy back Otrddnoe that being \nhis pet dream. \n\nHaving started farming from necessity, he \nsoon grew so devoted to it that it became his \nfavorite and almost his sole occupation. Nich- \nolas was a plain farmer: he did not like inno- \nvations, especially the English ones then com- \ning into vogue. He laughed at theoretical \ntreatises on estate management, disliked fac- \ntories, the raising of expensive products, and \nthe buying of expensive seed corn, and did not \nmake a hobby of any particular part of the \nwork on his estate. He always had before his \nmind's eye the estate as a whole and not any \nparticular part of it. The chief thing in his eyes \nwas not the nitrogen in the soil, nor the oxy- \ngen in the air, nor manures, nor special plows, \nbut that most important agent by which nitro- \ngen, oxygen, manure, and plow were made ef- \nfectivethe peasant laborer. When Nicholas \nfirst began farming and began to understand \nits different branches, it was the serf who es- \npecially attracted his attention. The peasant \n\n\n\nseemed to him not merely a tool, but also a \njudge of farming and an end in himself. At \nfirst he watched the serfs, trying to understand \ntheir aims and what they considered good and \nbad, and only pretended to direct them and \ngive orders while in reality learning from them \ntheir methods, their manner of speech, and \ntheir judgment of what was good and bad. \nOnly when he had understood the peasants' \ntastes and aspirations, had learned to talk their \nlanguage, to grasp the hidden meaning of \ntheir words, and felt akin to them did he be- \ngin boldly to manage his serfs, that is, to per- \nform toward them the duties demanded of \nhim. And Nicholas' management produced \nvery brilliant results. \n\nGuided by some gift of insight, on taking up \nthe management of the estates he at once un- \nerringly appointed as bailiff, village elder, and \ndelegate, the very men the serfs would them- \nselves have chosen had they had the right to \nchoose, and these posts never changed hands. \nBefore analyzing the properties of manure, be- \nfore entering into the debit and credit (as he \nironically called it), he found out how many \ncattle the peasants had and increased the num- \nber by all possible means. He kept the peasant \nfamilies together in the largest groups possible, \nnot allowing the family groups to divide into \nseparate households. He was hard alike on the \nlazy, the depraved, and the weak, and tried to \nget them expelled from the commune. \n\nHe was as careful of the sowing and reaping \nof the peasants' hay and corn as of his own, \nand few landowners had their crops sown and \nharvested so early and so well, or got so good a \nreturn, as did Nicholas. \n\nHe disliked having anything to do with the \ndomestic serfs the "drones" as he called them \nand everyone said he spoiled them by his \nlaxity. When a decision had to be taken re- \ngarding a domestic serf, especially if one had \nto be punished, he always felt undecided and \nconsulted everybody in the house; but when it \nwas possible to have a domestic serf conscripted \ninstead of a land worker he did so without the \nleast hesitation. He never felt any hesitation \nin dealing with the peasants. He knew that his \nevery decision would be approved by them all \nwith very few exceptions. \n\nHe did not allow himself either to be hard \non or punish a man, or to make things easy for \nor reward anyone, merely because he felt in- \nclined to do so. He could not have said by what \nstandard he judged what he should or should \nnot do, but the standard was quite firm and \n\n\n\ndefinite in his own mind. \n\nOften, speaking with vexation of some fail- \nure or irregularity, he would say: "What can \none do with our Russian peasants?" and imag- \nined that he could not bear them. \n\nYet he loved "our Russian peasants" and \ntheir way of life with his whole soul, and for \nthat very reason had understood and assimi- \nlated the one way and manner of farming \nwhich produced good results. \n\nCountess Mary was jealous of this passion of \nher husband's and regretted that she could not \nshare it; but she could not understand the joys \nand vexations he derived from that world, to \nher so remote and alien. She could not under- \nstand why he was so particularly animated and \nhappy when, after getting up at daybreak and \nspending the whole morning in the fields or \non the threshing floor, he returned from the \nsowing or mowing or reaping to have tea with \nher. She did not understand why he spoke with \nsuch admiration and delight of the farming of \nthe thrifty and well-to-do peasant Matthew \nErmishin, who with his family had carted corn \nall night; or of the fact that his (Nicholas') \nsheaves were already stacked before anyone \nelse had his harvest in. She did not understand \nwhy he stepped out from the window to the \nveranda and smiled under his mustache and \nwinked so joyfully, when warm steady rain be- \ngan to fall on the dry and thirsty shoots of the \nyoung oats, or why when the wind carried away \na threatening cloud during the hay harvest he \nwould return from the barn, flushed, sun- \nburned, and perspiring, with a smell of worm- \nwood and gentian in his hair and, gleefully \nrubbing his hands, would say: "Well, one more \nday and my grain and the peasants' will all be \nunder cover." \n\nStill less did she understand why he, kind- \nhearted and always ready to anticipate her \nwishes, should become almost desperate when \nshe brought him a petition from some peasant \nmen or women who had appealed to her to be \nexcused some work; why he, that kind Nicho- \nlas, should obstinately refuse her, angrily ask- \ning her not to interfere in what was not her \nbusiness. She felt he had a world apart, which \nhe loved passionately and which had laws she \nhad not fathomed. \n\nSometimes when, trying to understand him, \nshe spoke of the good work he was doing for \nhis serfs, he would be vexed and reply: "Not in \nthe least; it never entered my head and I \nwouldn't do that for their goodl That's all \npoetry and old wives' talkall that doing good \n\n\n\nFIRST EPILOGUE 655 \n\nto one's neighborl What I want is that our \n\n\n\nchildren should not have to go begging. I must \nput our affairs in order while I am alive, that's \nall. And to do that, order and strictness are \nessential. . . . That's all about it!" said he, \nclenching his vigorous fist. "And fairness, of \ncourse," he added, "for if the peasant is naked \nand hungry and has only one miserable horse, \nhe can do no good either for himself or for \nme." \n\nAnd all Nicholas did was fruitful probably \njust because he refused to allow himself to \nthink that he was doing good to others for vir- \ntue's sake. His means increased rapidly; serfs \nfrom neighboring estates came to beg him to \nbuy them, and long after his death the memory \nof his administration was devoutly preserved \namong the serfs. "He was a master . . . the peas- \nants' affairs first and then his own. Of course \nhe was not to be trifled with either in a word, \nhe was a real masterl" \n\nCHAPTER VIII \n\nONE MATTER connected with his management \nsometimes worried Nicholas, and that was his \nquick temper together with his old hussar hab- \nit of making free use of his fists. At first he saw \nnothing reprehensible in this, but in the sec- \nond year of his marriage his view of that form \nof punishment suddenly changed. \n\nOnce in summer he had sent for the village \nelder from Boguchdrovo, a man who had suc- \nceeded to the post when Dron died and who \nwas accused of dishonesty and various irregu- \nlarities. Nicholas went out into the porch to \nquestion him, and immediately after the elder \nhad given a few replies the sound of cries and \nblows were heard. On returning to lunch Nich- \nolas went up to his wife, who sat with her head \nbent low over her embroidery frame, and as \nusual began to tell her what he had been do- \ning that morning. Among other things he spoke \nof the Boguchclrovo elder. Countess Mary \nturned red and then pale, but continued to sit \nwith head bowed and lips compressed and gave \nher husband no reply. \n\n"Such an insolent scoundrel! "he cried, grow- \ning hot again at the mere recollection of him. \n"If he had told me he was drunk and did not \nsee ... But what is the matter with you, Mary?" \nhe suddenly asked. \n\nCountess Mary raised her head and tried to \nspeak, but hastily looked down again and her \nlips puckered. \n\n"Why, whatever is the matter, my dearest^" \n\nThe looks of the plain Countess Mary always \n\n\n\n6 5 6 \n\nimproved when she was in tears. She never \ncried from pain or vexation, but always from \nsorrow or pity, and when she wept her radiant \neyes acquired an irresistible charm. \n\nThe moment Nicholas took her hand she \ncould no longer restrain herself and began to \ncry. \n\n"Nicholas, I saw it ... he was to blame, but \nwhy do you . . . Nicholas!" and she covered her \nface with her hands. \n\nNicholas said nothing. He flushed crimson, \nleft her side, and paced up and down the room. \nHe understood what she was weeping about, \nbut could not in his heart at once agree with \nher that what he had regarded from childhood \nas quite an everyday event was wrong. "Is it \njust sentimentality, old wives' tales, or is she \nright?" he asked himself. Before he had solved \nthat point he glanced again at her face filled \nwith love and pain, and he suddenly realized \nthat she was right and that he had long been \nsinning against himself. \n\n"Mary," he said softly, going up to her, "it \nwill never happen again; I give you my word. \nNever," he repeated in a trembling voice like \na boy asking for forgiveness. \n\nThe tears flowed faster still from the count- \ness' eyes. She took his hand and kissed it. \n\n"Nicholas, when did you break your cameo?" \nshe asked to change the subject, looking at his \nfinger on which he wore a ring with a cameo of \nLaocoon's head. \n\n"Today it was the same affair. Oh, Mary, \ndon't remind me of ill" and again he flushed. \n"I give you my word of honor it shan't occur \nagain, and let this always be a reminder to me," \nand he pointed to the broken ring. \n\nAfter that, when in discussions with his vil- \nlage elders or stewards the blood rushed to his \nface and his fists began to clench, Nicholas \nwould turn the broken ring on his finger and \nwould drop his eyes before the man who was \nmaking him angry. But he did forget himself \nonce or twice within a twelvemonth, and then \nhe would go and confess to his wife, and would \nagain promise that this should really be the \nvery last time. \n\n"Mary, you must despise mel" he would say. \n"I deserve it." \n\n"You should go, go away at once, if you don't \nfeel itrong enough to control yourself," she \nwould reply sadly, trying to comfort her hus- \nband. \n\nAmong the gentry of the province Nicholas \nwas respected but not liked. He did not con- \ncern himself with the interests of his own class, \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\nand consequently some thought him proud and \nothers thought him stupid. The whole sum- \nmer, from spring sowing to harvest, he was \nbusy with the work on his farm. In autumn he \ngave himself up to hunting with the same busi- \nnesslike seriousness leaving home for a month, \nor even two, with his hunt. In winter he visited \nhis other villages or spent his time reading. \nThe books he read were chiefly historical, and \non these he spent a certain sum every year. He \nwas collecting, as he said, a serious library, and \nhe made it a rule to read through all the books \nhe bought. He would sit in his study with a \ngrave air, reading a task he first imposed up- \non himself as a duty, but which afterwards be- \ncame a habit affording him a special kind of \npleasure and a consciousness of being occu- \npied with serious matters. In winter, except \nfor business excursions, he spent most of his \ntime at home making himself one with his \nfamily and entering into all the details of his \nchildren's relations with their mother. The \nharmony between him and his wife grew closer \nand closer and he daily discovered fresh spir- \nitual treasures in her. \n\nFrom the time of his marriage S6nya had \nlived in his house. Before that, Nicholas had \ntold his wife all that had passed between him- \nself andS6nya, blaming himself and commend- \ning her. He had asked Princess Mary to be \ngentle and kind to his cousin. She thoroughly \nrealized the wrong he had doneS6nya, felt her- \nself to blame toward her, and imagined that \nher wealth had influenced Nicholas' choice. \nShe could not find fault with S6nya in any way \nand tried to be fond of her, but often felt ill- \nwill toward her which she could not overcome. \n\nOnce she had a talk with her friend Natasha \nabout S6nya and about her own injustice to- \nward her. \n\n"You know," said Natasha, "you have read \nthe Gospels a great deal there is a passage in \nthem that just fits S6nya." \n\n"What?" asked Countess Mary, surprised. \n\n" 'To him that hath shall be given, and from \nhim that hath not shall be taken away.' You \nremember? She is one that hath not; why, I \ndon't know. Perhaps she lacks egotism, I don't \nknow, but from her is taken away, and every- \nthing has been taken away. Sometimes I am \ndreadfully sorry for her. Formerly I very much \nwanted Nicholas to marry her, but I always \nhad a sort of presentiment that it would not \ncome off. She is a sterile flower, you know- \nlike some strawberry blossoms. Sometimes I \nam sorry for her, and sometimes I think she \n\n\n\nFIRST EPILOGUE \n\ndoesn't feel it as you or I would." \n\nThough Countess Mary told Natdsha that \nthose words in the Gospel must be understood \ndifferently, yet looking at S6nya she agreed \nwith Natasha's explanation. It really seemed \nthat S6nya did not feel her position trying, and \nhad grown quite reconciled toherlotasa$ter//e \nflower. She seemed to be fond not so much of \nindividuals as of the family as a whole. Like a \ncat, she had attached herself not to the people \nbut to the home. She waited on the old count- \ness, petted and spoiled the children, was al- \nways ready to render the small services for \nwhich she had a gift, and all this was uncon- \nsciously accepted from her with insufficient \ngratitude. \n\nThe country seat at Bald Hills had been re- \nbuilt, though not on the same scale as under \nthe old prince. \n\nThe buildings, begun under straitened cir- \ncumstances, were more than simple. The im- \nmense house on the old stone foundations was \nof wood, plastered only inside. It had bare \ndeal floors and was furnished with very simple \nhard sofas, armchairs, tables, and chairs made \nby their own serf carpenters out of their own \nbirchwood. The house was spacious and had \nrooms for the house serfs and apartments for \nvisitors. Whole families of the Rostovs' and \nBolk6nskis' relations sometimes came to Bald \nHills with sixteen horses and dozens of serv- \nants and stayed for months. Besides that, four \ntimes a year, on the name days and birthdays \nof the hosts, as many as a hundred visitors \nwould gather there for a day or two. The rest \nof the year life pursued its unbroken routine \nwith its ordinary occupations, and its break- \nfasts, lunches, dinners, and suppers, provided \nout of the produce of the estate. \n\n\n\n657 \n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX \n\nIT WAS the eve of St. Nicholas, the fifth of De- \ncember, 1820. Natasha had been staying at her \nbrother's with her husband and children since \nearly autumn. Pierre had gone to Petersburg \non business of his own for three weeks as he \nsaid, but had remained there nearly seven \nweeks and was expected back every minute. \n\nBesides the Beziikhov family, Nicholas' old \nfriend t the retired General Vasili Dmitrich \nDenisov was staying with the Rost6vs this fifth \nof December. \n\nOn the sixth, which was his name day when \nthe house would be full of visitors, Nicholas \nknew he would have to exchange his Tartar \ntunic for a tail coat, and put on narrow boots \n\n\n\nwith pointed toes, and drive to the new church \nhe had built, and then receive visitors who \nwould come to congratulate him, offer them re- \nfreshments, and talk about the elections of the \nnobility; but he considered himself entitled to \nspend the eve of that day in his usual way. He \nexamined the bailiff's accounts of the village \nin Ryazan which belonged to his wife's neph- \new, wrote two business letters, and walked over \nto the granaries, cattle yards and stables be- \nfore dinner. Having taken precautions against \nthe general drunkenness to be expected on the \nmorrow because it was a great saint's day, he \nreturned to dinner, and without having time \nfor a private talk with his wife sat down at \nthe long table laid for twenty persons, at \nwhich the whole household had assembled. At \nthat table were his mother, his mother's old \nlady companion Bel6va, his wife, their three \nchildren with their governess and tutor, his \nwife's nephew with his tutor, S6nya, Denisov, \nNatasha, her three children, their governess, \nand old Michael Ivnovich,the late prince's ar- \nchitect, who was living on in retirement at \nBald Hills. \n\nCountess Mary sat at the other end of the \ntable. When her husband took his place she \nconcluded, from the rapid manner in which \nafter taking up his table napkin he pushed \nback the tumbler and wineglass standing be- \nfore him, that he was out of humor, as was \nsometimes the case when he came in to din- \nner straight from the farm especially before \nthe soup. Countess Mary well knew that mood \nof his, and when she herself was in agood frame \nof mind quietly waited till he had had his soup \nand then began to talk to him and make him \nadmit that there was no cause for his ill-humor. \nBut today she quite forgot that and was hurt \nthat he should be angry with her without any \nreason, and she felt unhappy. She asked him \nwhere he had been. He replied. She again in- \nquired whether everything was going well on \nthe farm. Her unnatural tone made him wince \nunpleasantly and he replied hastily. \n\n"Then I'm not mistaken," thought Countess \nMary. "Why is he cross with me?" She conclud- \ned from his tone that he was vexed with her \nand wished to end the conversation. She knew \nher remarks sounded unnatural, but could not \nrefrain from asking some more questions. \n\nThanks to Denfsov the conversation at table \nsoon became general and lively, and she did \nnot talk to her husband. When they left the \ntable and went as usual to thank the old count- \ness, Countess Mary held out her hand and \n\n\n\n6 5 8 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nkissed her husband, and asked him why he was \nangry with her. \n\n"You always have such strange fancies! I \ndidn't even think of being angry," he replied. \n\nBut the word always seemed to her to im- \nply: "Yes, I am angry but I won't tell you why." \n\nNicholas and his wife lived together so hap- \npily that even S6nya and the old countess, who \nfelt jealous and would have liked them to dis- \nagree, could find nothing to reproach them \nwith; but even they had their moments of an- \ntagonism. Occasionally, and it was always just \nafter they had been happiest together, they \nsuddenly had a feeling of estrangement and \nhostility, which occurred most frequently dur- \ning Countess Mary's pregnancies, and this was \nsuch a time. \n\n"Well, messieurs et mesdames" said Nicho- \nlas loudly and with apparent cheerfulness (it \nseemed to Countess Mary that he did it on pur- \npose to vex her), "I have been on my feet since \nsix this morn ing. Tomorrow I shall have tosuf- \nfer, so today I'll go and rest." \n\nAnd without a word to his wife he went to \nthe little sitting room and lay down on the \nsofa. \n\n"That's always the way," thought Countess \nMary. "He talks to everyone except me. I see \n... I see that I am repulsive to him, especially \nwhen I am in this condition." She looked down \nat her expanded figure and in the glass at her \npale, sallow, emaciated face in which her eyes \nnow looked larger than ever. \n\nAnd everything annoyed her Denfsov's \nshouting and laughter, Natasha's talk, and es- \npecially a quick glance S6nya gave her. \n\nS6nya was always the first excuse Countess \nMary found for feeling irritated. \n\nHaving sat awhile with her visitors without \nunderstanding anything of what they were \nsaying, she softly left the room and went to \nthe nursery. \n\nThe children were playing at "going to Mos- \ncow" in a carriage made of chairs and invited \nher to go with them. She sat down and played \nwith them a little, but the thought of her hus- \nband and his unreasonable crossness worried \nher. She got up and, walking on tiptoe with \ndifficulty, went to the small sitting room. \n\n"Perhaps he is not asleep; I'll have an ex- \nplanation with him," she said to herself. Little \nAndrew, her eldest boy, imitating his mother, \nfollowed her on tiptoe. She did not notice him. \n\n"Mary, dear, I think he is asleephe was so \ntired," said S6nya, meeting her in the large \nsitting room (it seemed to Countess Mary that \n\n\n\nshe crossed her path everywhere). "Andrew \nmay wake him." \n\nCountess Mary looked round, saw little An- \ndrew following her, felt that S6nya was right, \nand for that very reason flushed and with evi- \ndent difficulty refrained from saying something \nharsh. She made no reply, but to avoid obeying \nS6nya beckoned to Andrew to follow her quiet- \nly and went to the door. S6nya went away by \nanother door. From the room in which Nicho- \nlas was sleeping came the sound of his even \nbreathing, every slightest tone of which was fa- \nmiliar to his wife. As she listened to it she saw \nbefore her his smooth handsome forehead, his \nmustache, and his whole face, as she had so \noften seen it in the stillness of the night when \nhe slept. Nicholas suddenly moved and cleared \nhis throat. And at that moment little Andrew \nshouted from outside the door: "Papa! Mam- \nma's standing herel" Countess Mary turned \npale with fright and made signs to the boy. \nHe grew silent, and quiet ensued fora moment, \nterrible to Countess Mary. She knew how \nNicholas disliked being waked. Then through \nthe door she heard Nicholas clearing his throat \nagain and stirring, and his voice said crossly: \n\n"I can't get a moment's peace. . . . Mary, is \nthat you? Why did you bring him here?" \n\n"I only came in to look and did not notice \n. . . forgive me. . . ." \n\nNicholas coughed and said no more. Count- \ness Mary moved away from the door and took \nthe boy back to the nursery. Five minutes later \nlittle black-eyed three-year-old Natasha, her \nfather's pet, having learned from her brother \nthat Papa was asleep and Mamma was in the \nsitting room, ran to her father unobserved by \nher mother. The dark-eyed little girl boldly \nopened the creaking door, went up to the sofa \nwith energetic steps of her sturdy little legs, \nand having examined the position of her fa- \nther, who was asleep with his back to her, rose \non tiptoe and kissed the hand which lay under \nhis head. Nicholas turned with a tender smile \non his face. \n\n"Natdsha, Natasha!" came Countess Mary's \nfrightened whisper from the door. "Papa wants \nto sleep." \n\n"No, Mamma, he doesn't want to sleep," said \nlittle Natdsha with conviction. "He's laugh- \ning." \n\nNicholas lowered his legs, rose, and took \nhis daughter in his arms. \n\n"Come in, Mary," he said to his wife. \n\nShe went in and sat down by her husband. \n\n"I did not notice him following me/' she \n\n\n\nFIRST EPILOGUE \n\nsaid timidly. "I just looked in." \n\nHolding his little girl with one arm, Nicholas \nglanced at his wife and, seeing her guilty ex- \npression, put his other arm around her and \nkissed her hair. \n\n"May I kiss Mamma?" he asked Natasha. \n\nNatasha smiled bashfully. \n\n"Again I" she commanded, pointing with a \nperemptory gesture to the spot where Nicho- \nlas had placed the kiss. \n\n"I don't know why you think I am cross," \nsaid Nicholas, reply ing to the question he knew \nwas in his wife's mind. \n\n"You have no idea how unhappy, how lone- \nly, I feel when you are like that. It always seems \nto me . . ." \n\n"Mary, don't talk nonsense. You ought to be \nashamed of yourself 1" he said gaily. \n\n"It seems to be that you can't love me, that \nI am so plain . . . always . . . and now ... in \nthis cond . . ." \n\n"Oh, how absurd you arel It is not beauty \nthat endears, it's love that makes us see beauty. \nIt is only Malvinas and women of that kind \nwho are loved for their beauty. But do I love \nmy wife? I don't love her, but ... I don't know \nhow to put it. Without you, or when some- \nthing comes between us like this, I seem lost \nand can't do anything. Now do I love my fin- \nger? I don't love it, but just try to cut it offl" \n\n"I'm not like that myself, but I understand. \nSo you're not angry with me?" \n\n"Awfully angry!" he said, smiling and get- \nting up. And smoothing his hair he began to \npace the room. \n\n"Do you know, Mary, what I've been think- \ning?" he began, immediately thinking aloud \nin his wife's presence now that they had made \nit up. \n\nHe did not ask if she was ready to listen to \nhim. He did not care. A thought had occurred \nto him and so it belonged to her also. And he \ntold her of his intention to persuade Pierre to \nstay with them till spring. \n\nCountess Mary listened till he had finished, \nmade some remark, and in her turn began \nthinking aloud. Her thoughts were about the \nchildren. \n\n"You can see the woman in her already," \nshe sajfl in French, pointing to little Natasha. \n"You reproach us women with being illogical. \nHere is our logic. I say: 'Papa wants to sleep!' \nbut she says, 'No, he's laughing.' And she was \nright," said Countess Mary with a happy smile. \n\n"Yes, yes." And Nicholas, taking his little \ndaughter in his strong hand, lifted her high, \n\n\n\n6 59 \n\nplaced her on his shoulder, held her by the \nlegs, and paced the room with her. There was \nan expression of carefree happiness on the \nfaces of both father and daughter. \n\n"But you know you may be unfair. You are \ntoo fond of this one," his wife whispered in \nFrench. \n\n"Yes, but what am I to do? ... I try not to \nshow . . ." \n\nAt that moment they heard the sound of the \ndoor pulley and footsteps in the hall and ante- \nroom, as if someone had arrived. \n\n"Somebody has come." \n\n"I am sure it is Pierre. I will go and see," said \nCountess Mary and left the room. \n\nIn her absence Nicholas allowed himself to \ngive his little daughter a gallop round the \nroom. Out of breath, he took the laughing \nchild quickly from his shoulder and pressed \nher to his heart. His capers reminded him of \ndancing, and looking at the child's round hap- \npy little face he thought of what she would be \nlike when he was an old man, taking her into \nsociety and dancing the mazurka with her as \nhis old father had danced Daniel Cooper with \nhis daughter. \n\n"It is he, it is he, Nicholas!" said Countess \nMary, re-entering the room a few minutes lat- \ner. "Now our Natdsha has come to life. You \nshould have seen her ecstasy, and how he caught \nit for having stayed away so long. Well, come \nalong now, quick, quick! It's time you two were \nparted," she added, looking smilingly at the \nlittle girl who clung to her father. \n\nNicholas went out holding the child by the \nhand. \n\nCountess Mary remained in the sittingroom. \n\n"I should never, never have believed that \none could be so happy," she whispered to her- \nself. A smile lit up her face but at the same \ntime she sighed, and her deep eyes expressed a \nquiet sadness as though she felt, through her \nhappiness, that there is another sort of hap- \npiness unattainable in this life and of which \nshe involuntarily thought at that instant. \n\nCHAPTER X \n\nNATASHA HAD MARRIED in the early spring of \n1813, and in 1820 already had three daughters \nbesides a son for whom she had longed and \nwhom she was now nursing. She had grown \nstouter and broader, so that it was difficult to \nrecognize in this robust, motherly woman the \nslim, lively Natdsha of former days. Hfer fea- \ntures were more defined and had a calm, soft, \nand serene expression. In her face there was \n\n\n\n66o \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nnone of the ever-glowing animation that had \nformerly burned there and constituted its \ncharm. Now her face and body were often all \nthat one saw, and her soul was not visible at \nall. All that struck the eye was a strong, hand- \nsome, and fertile woman. The old fire very \nrarely kindled in her face now. That happened \nonly when, as was the case that day, her hus- \nband returned home, or a sick child was conva- \nlescent, or when she and Countess Mary spoke \nof Prince Andrew (she never mentioned him \nto her husband, who she imagined was jealous \nof Prince Andrew's memory), or on the rare \noccasions when something happened to induce \nher to sing, a practice she had quite abandoned \nsince her marriage. At the rare moments when \nthe old fire did kindle in her handsome, fully \ndeveloped body she was even more attractive \nthan in former days. \n\nSince their marriage Natasha and her hus- \nband had lived in Moscow, in Petersburg, on \ntheir estate near Moscow, or with her mother, \nthat is to say, in Nicholas' house. The young \nCountess Beziikhova was not often seen in so- \nciety, and those who met her there were not \npleased with her and found her neither at- \ntractive nor amiable. Not that Natasha liked \nsolitude she did not know whether she liked \nit or not, she even thought that she did riot- \nbut with her pregnancies, her confinements, \nthe nursing of her children, and sharing every \nmoment of her husband's life, she had de- \nmands on her time which could be satisfied \nonly byrenouncingsociety. All who had known \nNatasha before her marriage wondered at the \nchange in her as at something extraordinary. \nOnly the old countess with her maternal in- \nstinct had realized that all Natasha's outbursts \nhad been due to her need of children and a \nhusband as she herself had once exclaimed at \nOtradnoe not so much in fun as in earnest \nand her mother was now surprised at the sur- \nprise expressed by those who had never under- \nstood Natasha, and she kept saying that she \nhad always known that Natasha would make \nan exemplary wife and mother. \n\n"Only she lets her love of her husband and \nchildren overflow all bounds," said the count- \ness, "so that it even becomes absurd." \n\nNatasha did not follow the golden rule ad- \nvocated by clever folk, especially by the French, \nwhich says that a girl should not let herself go \nwhen she marries, should not neglect her ac- \ncomplishments, should be even more careful \nof her appearance than when she was unmar- \nried, and should fascinate her husband as much \n\n\n\nas she did before he became her husband. Na- \ntasha on the contrary had at once abandoned \nall her witchery, of which her singing had been \nan unusually powerful part. She gave it up \njust because it was so powerfully seductive. \nShe took no pains with her manners or with \ndelicacy of speech, or with her toilet, or to show \nherself to her husband in her most becoming \nattitudes, or to avoid inconveniencing him \nby being too exacting. She acted in contradic- \ntion to all those rules. She felt that the allure- \nments instinct had formerly taught her to use \nwould now be merely ridiculous in the eyes of \nher husband, to whom she had from the first \nmoment given herself up entirely that is, with \nher whole soul, leaving no corner of it hidden \nfrom him. She felt that her unity with her hus- \nband was not maintained by the poetic feel- \nings that had attracted him to her, but by \nsomething else indefinite but firm as the bond \nbetween her own body and soul. \n\nTo fluff out her curls, put on fashionable \ndresses, and sing romantic songs to fascinate \nher husband would have seemed as strange as \nto adorn herself to attract herself. To adorn \nherself for others might perhaps have been \nagreeable she did not know but she had no \ntime at all for it. The chief reason for devoting \nno time either to singing, to dress, or to choos- \ning her words was that she really had no time \nto spare for these things. \n\nWe know that man has the faculty of becom- \ning completely absorbed in a subject however \ntrivial it may be, and that there is no subject so \ntrivial that it will not grow to infinite propor- \ntions if one's entire attention is devoted to it. \n\nThe subject which wholly engrossed Nata- \nsha's attention was her family: that is, her hus- \nband whom she had to keep so that he should \nbelong entirely to her and to the home, and \nthe children whom she had to bear, bring into \nthe world, nurse, and bring up. \n\nAnd the deeper she penetrated, not with \nher mind only but with her whole soul, her \nwhole being, into the subject that absorbed \nher, the larger did that subject grow and the \nweaker and more inadequate did her own pow- \ners appear, so that she concentrated them whol- \nly on that one thing and yet was unable to ac- \ncomplish all that she considered necessary. \n\nThere were then as now conversations and \ndiscussions about women's rights, the relations \nof husband and wife and their freedom and \nrights, though these themes were not yet \nteamed questions as they are now; but these \ntopics were not merely uninteresting to Na- \n\n\n\nFIRST EPILOGUE \n\n\n\n661 \n\n\n\ntdsha, she positively did not understand them. \n\nThese questions, then as now, existed only \nfor those who see nothing in marriage but the \npleasure married people get from one another, \nthat is, only the beginnings of marriage and \nnot its whole significance, which lies in the \nfamily. \n\nDiscussions and questions of that kind, which \nare like the question of how to get the greatest \ngratification from one's dinner, did not then \nand do not now exist for those for whom the \npurpose of a dinner is the nourishment it af- \nfords; and the purpose of marriage is the fam- \nily. \n\nIf the purpose of dinner is to nourish the \nbody, a man who eats two dinners at once \nmay perhaps get more enjoyment but will not \nattain his purpose, for his stomach will not di- \ngest the two dinners. \n\nIf the purpose of marriage is the family, the \nperson who wishes to have many wives or hus- \nbands may perhaps obtain much pleasure, but \nin that case will not have a family. \n\nIf the purpose of food is nourishment and \nthe purpose of marriage is the family, the whole \nquestion resolves itself into not eating more \nthan one can digest, and not having more wives \nor husbands than are needed for the family \nthat is, one wife or one husband. Natisha need- \ned a husband. A husband was given her and he \ngave her a family. And she not only saw no \nneed of any other or better husband, but as all \nthe powers of her soul were intent on serving \nthat husband and family, she could not imag- \nine and saw no interest in imagining how it \nwould be if things were different. \n\nNatasha did not care for society in general, \nbut prized the more the society of her rela- \ntivesCountess Mary, and her brother, her \nmother, and S6nya. She valued the company \nof those to whom she could come striding di- \nsheveled from the nursery in her dressing gown, \nand with joyful face show a yellow instead of \na green stain on baby's napkin, and from whom \nshe could hear reassuring words to the effect \nthat baby was much better. \n\nTo such an extent had Natasha let herself go \nthat the way she dressed and did her hair, her \nill-chosen words, and her jealousy she was \njealouiof S6nya, of the governess, and of every \nwoman, pretty or plain were habitual sub- \njects of jest to those about her. The general \nopinion was that Pierre was under his wife's \nthumb, which was really true. From the very \nfirst days of their married life Natasha had an- \nnounced her demands. Pierre was greatly sur- \n\n\n\nprised by his wife's view, to him a perfectly \nnovel one, that every moment of his life be- \nlonged to her and to the family. His wife's de- \nmands astonished him, but they also flattered \nhim, and he submitted to them. \n\nPierre's subjection consisted in the fact that \nhe not only dared not flirt with, but dared not \neven speak smilingly to, any other woman; did \nnot dare dine at the Club as a pastime, did not \ndare spend money on a whim, and did not dare \nabsent himself for any length of time, except \non business in which his wife included his in- \ntellectual pursuits, which she did not in the \nleast understand but to which she attributed \ngreat importance. To make up for this, at \nhome Pierre had the right to regulate his life \nand that of the whole family exactly as he \nchose. At home Natdsha placed herself in the \nposition of a slave to her husband, and the \nwhole household went on tiptoe when he was \noccupied that is, was reading or writing in his \nstudy. Pierre had but to show a partiality for \nanything to get just what he liked done always. \nHe had only to express a wish and Natasha \nwould jump up and run to fulfill it. \n\nThe entire household was governed accord- \ning to Pierre's supposed orders, that is, by his \nwishes which Natasha tried to guess. Their \nway of life and place of residence, their ac- \nquaintances and ties, Natasha's occupations, \nthe children's upbringing, were all selected not \nmerely with regard to Pierre's expressed wishes, \nbut to what Natasha from the thoughts he ex- \npressed in conversation supposed his wishes to \nbe. And she deduced the essentials of his wish- \nes quite correctly, and having once arrived at \nthem clung to them tenaciously. When Pierre \nhimself wanted to change his mind she would \nfight him with his own weapons. \n\nThus in a time of trouble ever memorable to \nhim after the birth of their first child who was \ndelicate, when they had to change the wet \nnurse three times and Natdsha fell ill from de- \nspair, Pierre one day told her of Rousseau's \nview, with which he quite agreed, that to have \na wet nurse is unnatural and harmful. When \nher next baby was born, despite the opposi- \ntion of her mother, the doctors, and even of \nher husband himself who were all vigorously \nopposed to her nursing her baby herself, a \nthing then unheard of and considered injuri- \nousshe insisted on having her own way, and \nafter that nursed all her babies herself. \n\nIt very often happened that in a moment of \nirritation husband and wife would have a dis- \npute, but long afterwards Pierre to his sur- \n\n\n\n662 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nprise and delight would find in his wife's ideas \nand actions the very thought against which she \nhad argued, but divested of everything super- \nfluous that in the excitement of the dispute he \nhad added when expressing his opinion. \n\nAfter seven years of marriage Pierre had the \njoyous and firm consciousness that he was not \na bad man, and he felt this because he saw \nhimself reflected in his wife. He felt the good \nand bad within himself inextricably mingled \nand overlapping. But only what was really \ngood in him was reflected in his wife, all that \nwas not quite good was rejected. And this was \nnot the result of logical reasoning but was a \ndirect and mysterious reflection. \n\nCHAPTER XI \n\nTwo MONTHS PREVIOUSLY when Pierre was al- \nready staying with the Rost6vs he had received \na letter from Prince Theodore, asking him to \ncome to Petersburg to confer on some impor- \ntant questions that were being discussed there \nby a society of which Pierre was one of the \nprincipal founders. \n\nOn reading that letter (she always read her \nhusband's letters) Natdsha herself suggested \nthat he should go to Petersburg, though she \nwould feel his absence very acutely. She at- \ntributed immense importance to all her hus- \nband's intellectual and abstract interests \nthough she did not understand them, and she \nalways dreaded being a hindrance to him in \nsuch matters. To Pierre's timid look of inquiry \nafter reading the letter she replied by asking \nhim to go, but to fix a definite date for his re- \nturn. He was given four weeks' leave of ab- \nsence. \n\nEver since that leave of absence had expired, \nmore than a fortnight before, Natasha had \nbeen in a constant state of alarm, depression, \nand irritability. \n\nDenisov, now a general on the retired list \nand much dissatisfied with the present state of \naffairs, had arrived during that fortnight. He \nlooked at Natasha with sorrow and surprise as \nat a bad likeness of a person once dear. A dull, \ndejected look, random replies, and talk about \nthe nursery was all he saw and heard from his \nformer enchantress. \n\nNatasha was sad and irritable all that time, \nespecially when her mother, her brother, S6nya, \nor Countess Mary in their efforts to console her \ntried to excuse Pierre and suggested reasons \nfor his delay in returning. \n\n"It's all nonsense, all rubbish those discus- \nsions which lead to nothing and all those idi- \n\n\n\notic societies!" Natasha declared of the very af- \nfairs in the immense importance of which she \nfirmly believed. \n\nAnd she would go to the nursery to nurse \nP6tya, her only boy. No one else could tell her \nanything so comforting or so reasonable as \nthis little three-month-old creature when he \nlay at her breast and she was conscious of the \nmovement of his lips and the snuffling of his \nlittle nose. That creature said: "You are angry, \nyou are jealous, you would like to pay him \nout, you are afraidbut here am II And I am \nhe . . ." and that was unanswerable. It was \nmore than true. \n\nDuring that fortnight of anxiety Natasha \nresorted to the baby for comfort so often, and \nfussed over him so much, that she overfed him \nand he fell ill. She was terrified by his illness, \nand yet that was just what she needed. While \nattending to him she bore the anxiety about \nher husband more easily. \n\nShe was nursing her boy when the sound of \nPierre's sleigh was heard at the front door, and \nthe old nurse knowing how to please her mis- \ntressentered the room inaudibly but hurried- \nly and with a beaming face. \n\n"Has he come?" Natdsha asked quickly in a \nwhisper, afraid to move lest she should rouse \nthe dozing baby. \n\n"He's come, ma'am," whispered the nurse. \n\nThe blood rushed to Natdsha's face and her \nfeet involuntarily moved, but she could not \njump up and run out. The baby again opened \nhis eyes and looked at her. "You're here?" he \nseemed to be saying, and again lazily smacked \nhis lips. \n\nCautiously withdrawing her breast, Natdsha \nrocked him a little, handed him to the nurse, \nand went with rapid steps toward the door. \nBut at the door she stopped as if her conscience \nreproached her for having in her joy left the \nchild too soon, and she glanced round. The \nnurse with raised elbows was lifting the in- \nfant over the rail of his cot. \n\n"Go, ma'aml Don't worry, go!" she whis- \npered, smiling, with the kind of familiarity \nthat grows up between a nurse and her mis- \ntress. \n\nNatdsha ran with light footsteps to the ante- \nroom. \n\nDenfsov, who had come out of the study in- \nto the dancing room with his pipe, now for the \nfirst time recognized the old Natdsha. A flood \nof brilliant, joyful light poured from her trans- \nfigured face. \n\n"He's come!" she exclaimed as she ran past, \n\n\n\nFIRST EPILOGUE \n\nand Denfsov felt that he too was delighted that \nPierre, whom he did not much care for, had re- \nturned. \n\nOn reaching the vestibule Natasha saw a tall \nfigure in a fur coat unwinding his scarf. "It's \nhe! It's really hel He has come!" she said to \nherself, and rushing at him embraced him, \npressed his head to her breast, and then pushed \nhim back and gazed at his ruddy, happy face, \ncovered with hoarfrost. "Yes, it is he, happy \nand contented. . . ." \n\nThen all at once she remembered the tor- \ntures of suspense she had experienced for the \nlast fortnight, and the joy that had lit up her \nface vanished; she frowned and overwhelmed \nPierre with a torrent of reproaches and angry \nwords. \n\n"Yes, it's all very well for you. You are \npleased, you've had a good time. . . . But what \nabout me? You might at least have shown con- \nsideration for the children. I am nursing and \nmy milk was spoiled. . . . Pckya was at death's \ndoor. But you were enjoying yourself. Yes, en- \njoying . . ." \n\nPierre knew he was not to blame, for he \ncould not have come sooner; he knew this out- \nburst was unseemly and would blow over in a \nminute or two; above all he knew that he him- \nself was bright and happy. He wanted to smile \nbut dared not even think of doing so. He made \na piteous, frightened face and bent down. \n\n"I could not, on my honor. But how is Pe*t- \nya?" \n\n"All right now. Come along! I wonder you're \nnot ashamed! If only you could see what I was \nlike without you, how I suffered!" \n\n"You are well?" \n\n"Come, come!" she said, not letting go of his \narm. And they went to their rooms. \n\nWhen Nicholas and his wife came to look for \nPierre he was in the nursery holding his baby \nson, who was again awake, on his huge right \npalm and dandling him. A blissful bright smile \nwas fixed on the baby's broad face with its \ntoothless open mouth. The storm was long \nsince over and there was bright, joyous sun- \nshine on Natasha's face as she gazed tenderly \nat her husband and child. \n\n"And have you talked everything well over \nwith Prince Theodore?" she asked. \n\n"Yes, capitally." \n\n"You see, he holds it up." (She meant the \nbaby's head.) "But how he did frighten me ... \nYou've seen the princess? Is it true she's in love \nwith that . . ." \n\n"Yes, just fancy . . ." \n\n\n\n663 \n\nAt that moment Nicholas and Countess \nMary came in. Pierre with the baby on his \nhand stooped, kissed them, and replied to \ntheir inquiries. But in spite of much that was \ninteresting and had to be discussed, the baby \nwith the little cap on its unsteady head evi- \ndently absorbed all his attention. \n\n"How sweet!" said Countess Mary, looking \nat and playing with the baby. "Now, Nicholas," \nshe added, turning to her husband, "I can't \nunderstand how it is you don't see the charm \nof these delicious marvels." \n\n"I don't and can't," replied Nicholas, look- \ning coldly at the baby. "A lump of flesh. Come \nalong, Pierre!" \n\n"And yet he's such an affectionate father," \nsaid Countess Mary, vindicating her husband, \n"but only after they are a year old or so . . ." \n\n"Now, Pierre nurses them splendidly," said \nNatasha. "He says his hand is just made for a \nbaby's seat. Just look!" \n\n"Only not for this . . ." Pierre suddenly ex- \nclaimed with a laugh, and shifting the baby \nhe gave him to the nurse. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII \n\nAs IN EVERY large household, there were at \nBald Hills several perfectly distinct worlds \nwhich merged into one harmonious whole, \nthough each retained its own peculiarities and \nmade concessions to the others. Every event, \njoyful or sad, that took place in that house was \nimportant to all these worlds, but each had its \nown special reasons to rejoice or grieve over \nthat occurrence independently of the others. \n\nFor instance, Pierre's return was a joyful and \nimportant event and they all felt it to be so. \n\nThe servants the most reliable judges of \ntheir masters because they judge not by their \nconversation or expressions of feeling but by \ntheir acts and way of life were glad of Pierre's \nreturn because they knew that when he was \nthere Count Nicholas would cease going every \nday to attend to the estate, and would be in bet- \nter spirits and temper, and also because they \nwould all receive handsome presents for the \nholidays. \n\nThe children and their governesses were \nglad of Pierre's return because no one else \ndrew them into the social life of the household \nas he did. He alone could play on the clavichord \nthat dcossaise (his only piece) to which, as he \nsaid, all possible dances could be danced, and \nthey felt sure he had brought presents for them \nall. \n\nYoung Nicholas, now a slim lad of fifteen, \n\n\n\n664 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\ndelicate and intelligent, with curly light-brown \nhair and beautiful eyes, was delighted because \nUncle Pierre as he called him was the object \nof his rapturous and passionate affection. No \none had instilled into him this love for Pierre \nwhom he saw only occasionally. Countess \nMary who had brought him up had done her \nutmost to make him love her husband as she \nloved him, and little Nicholas did love his un- \ncle, but loved him with just a shade of con- \ntempt. Pierre, however, he adored. He did not \nwant to be an hussar or a Knight of St. George \nlike his uncle Nicholas; he wanted to be learn- \ned, wise, and kind like Pierre. In Pierre's pres- \nence his face always shone with pleasure and \nhe flushed and was breathless when Pierre \nspoke to him. He did not miss a single word \nhe uttered, and would afterwards, with Dessal- \nles or by himself, recall and reconsider the \nmeaningof everything Pierre had said. Pierre's \npast life and his unhappiness prior to 18 1 2 (of \nwhich young Nicholas had formed a vague po- \netic picture from some words he had overheard), \nhis adventures in Moscow, his captivity, Plat6n \nKarataev (of whom he had heard from Pierre), \nhis love for Natdsha (of whom the lad was also \nparticularly fond), and especially Pierre's \nfriendship with the father whom Nicholas \ncould not remember all this made Pierre in \nhis eyes a hero and a saint. \n\nFrom broken remarks about Natasha and his \nfather, from the emotion with which Pierre \nspoke of that dead father, and from the careful, \nreverent tenderness with which Natdsha spoke \nof him, the boy, who was only just beginning \nto guess what love is, derived the notion that \nhis father had loved Natdsha and when dying \nhad left her to his friend. But the father whom \nthe boy did not remember appeared to him a \ndivinity who could not be pictured, and of \nwhom he never thought without a swelling \nheart and tears of sadness and rapture. So the \nboy also was happy that Pierre had arrived. \n\nThe guests welcomed Pierre because he al- \nways helped to enliven and unite any company \nhe was in. \n\nThe grown-up members of the family, not \nto mention his wife, were pleased to have back \na friend whose presence made life run more \nsmoothly and peacefully. \n\nThe old ladies were pleased with the pres- \nents he brought them, and especially that Na- \ntdsha would now be herself again. \n\nPierre felt the different outlooks of these \nvarious worlds and made haste to satisfy all \ntheir expectations. \n\n\n\nThough the most absent-minded and for- \ngetful of men, Pierre, with the aid of a list his \nwife drew up, had now bought everything, not \nforgetting his mother-and brother-in-law's com- \nmissions, nor the dress material for a present \nto Bel6va, nor toys for his wife's nephews. In \nthe early days of his marriage it had seemed \nstrange to him that his wife should expect him \nnot to forget to procure all the things he under- \ntook to buy, and he had been taken aback by \nher serious annoyance when on his first trip \nhe forgot everything. But in time he grew used \nto this demand. Knowing that Natasha asked \nnothing for herself, and gave him commissions \nfor others only when he himself had offered to \nundertake them, he now found an unexpected \nand childlike pleasure in this purchase of \npresents for everyone in the house, and never \nforgot anything. If he now incurred Natasha's \ncensure it was only for buying too many and \ntoo expensive things. To her other defects (as \nmost people thought them, but which to Pierre \nwere qualities) of untidiness and neglect of \nherself, she now added stinginess. \n\nFrom the time that Pierre began life as a \nfamily man on a footing entailing heavy ex- \npenditure, he had noticed to his surprise that \nhe spent only half as much as before, and that \nhis affairs which had been in disorder of late, \nchiefly because of his first wife's debts had be- \ngun to improve. \n\nLife was cheaper because it was circum- \nscribed: that most expensive luxury, the kind \nof life that can be changed at any moment, was \nno longer his nor did he wish for it. He felt \nthat his way of life had now been settled once \nfor all till death and that to change it was not \nin his power, and so that way of life proved \neconomical. \n\nWith a merry, smiling face Pierre was sort- \ning his purchases. \n\n"What do you think of this?" said he, un- \nrolling a piece of stuff like a shopman. \n\nNatasha, who was sitting opposite to him \nwith her eldest daughter on her lap, turned \nher sparkling eyes swiftly from her husband \nto the things he showed her. \n\n"That's for Bel6va? Excellentl" She felt the \nquality of the material. "It was a ruble an ar- \nshin, I suppose?" \n\nPierre told her the price. \n\n"Too dear!" Natdsha remarked. "How \npleased the children will be and Mamma too! \nOnly you need not have bought me this," she \nadded, unable to suppress a smile as she gazed \nadmiringly at a gold comb set with pearls, of \n\n\n\nFIRST EPILOGUE \n\n\n\na kind then just coming into fashion. \n\n"Adele tempted me: she kept on telling me \nto buy it," returned Pierre. \n\n"When am I to wear it?" and Natdsha stuck \nit in her coil of hair. "When I take little Mdsha \ninto society? Perhaps they will be fashionable \nagain by then. Well, let's go now." \n\nAnd collecting the presents they went first \nto the nursery and then to the old countess* \nrooms. \n\nThe countess was sitting with her companion \nBel6va, playing grand-patience as usual, when \nPierre and Natdsha came into the drawing \nroom with parcels under their arms. \n\nThe countess was now over sixty, was quite \ngray, and wore a cap with a frill that sur- \nrounded her face. Her face had shriveled, her \nupper lip had sunk in, and her eyes were dim. \n\nAfter the deaths of her son and husband in \nsuch rapid succession, she felt herself a being \naccidentally forgotten in this world and left \nwithout aim or object for her existence. She \nate, drank, slept, or kept awake, but did not \nlive. Life gave her no new impressions. She \nwanted nothing from life but tranquillity, and \nthat tranquillity only death could give her. \nBut until death came she had to go on living, \nthat is, to use her vital forces. A peculiarity \none sees in very young children and very old \npeople was particularly evident in her. Her life \nhad no external aims only a need to exercise \nher various functions and inclinations was ap- \nparent. She had to eat, sleep, think, speak, weep, \nwork, give vent to her anger, and so on, merely \nbecause she had a stomach, a brain, muscles, \nnerves, and a liver. She did these things not \nunder any external impulse as people in the \nfull vigor of life do, when behind the purpose \nfor which they strive that of exercising their \nfunctions remains unnoticed. She talked only \nbecause she physically needed to exercise her \ntongue and lungs. She cried as a child does, be- \ncause her nose had to be cleared, and so on. \nWhat for people in their full vigor is an aim \nwas for her evidently merely a pretext. \n\nThus in the morning especially if she had \neaten anything rich the day before she felt a \nneed of being angry and would choose as the \nhandiest pretext BekSva's deafness. \n\nShe would begin to say something to her in \na low tone from the other end of die room. \n\n"It seems a little warmer today, my dear," \nshe would murmur. \n\nAnd when Bel6va replied: "Oh yes, they've \ncome," she would mutter angrily: "O Lord! \nHow stupid and deaf she is!" \n\n\n\nAnother pretext would be her snuff, which \nwould seem too dry or too damp or not rubbed \nfine enough. After these fits of irritability her \nface would grow yellow, and her maids knew \nby infallible symptoms when Bel6va would \nagain be deaf, the snuff damp, and the count- \ness' face yellow. Just as she needed to work off \nher spleen so she had sometimes to exercise her \nstill-existing faculty of thinking and the pre- \ntext for that was a game of patience. When she \nneeded to cry, the deceased count would be \nthe pretext. When she wanted to be agitated, \nNicholas and his health would be the pretext, \nand when she felt a need to speak spitefully, \nthe pretext would be Countess Mary. When \nher vocal organs needed exercise, which was \nusually toward seven o'clock when she had \nhad an after-dinner rest in a darkened room, \nthe pretext would be the retelling of the same \nstories over and over again to the same audi- \nence. \n\nThe old lady's condition was understood by \nthe whole household though no one ever spoke \nof it, and they all made every possible effort \nto satisfy her needs. Only by a rare glance ex- \nchanged with a sad smile between Nicholas, \nPierre, Natdsha, and Countess Mary was the \ncommon understanding of her condition ex- \npressed. \n\nBut those glances expressed something \nmore: they said that she had played her part \nin life, that what they now saw was not her \nwhole self, that we must all become like her, \nand that they were glad to yield to her, to re- \nstrain themselves for this once precious being \nformerly as full of life as themselves, but now \nso much to be pitied. "Memento mori" said \nthese glances. \n\nOnly the really heartless, the stupid ones of \nthat household, and the little children failed \nto understand this and avoided her. \n\nCHAPTER XIII \n\nWHEN PIERRE and his wife entered thedrawing \nroom the countess was in one of her customary \nstates in which she needed the mental exertion \nof playing patience, and so though by force \nof habit she greeted him with the words she al- \nways used when Pierre or her son returned aft- \ner an absence: "High time, my dear, high time! \nWe were all weary of waiting for you. Well, \nthank God!" and received her presents with \nanother customary remark: "It's not the gift \nthat's precious, my dear, but that you give it \nto me, an old woman . . ."yet it was evident \nthat she was not pleased by Pierre's arrival at \n\n\n\n666 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nthat moment when it diverted her attention \nfrom the unfinished game. \n\nShe finished her game of patience and only \nthen examined the presents. They consisted \nof a box for cards, of splendid workmanship, a \nbright-blue Sevres tea cup with shepherdesses \ndepicted on it and with a lid, and a gold snuff- \nbox with the count's portrait on the lid which \nPierre had had done by a miniaturist in Pe- \ntersburg. The countess had long wished for \nsuch a box, but as she did not want to cry just \nthen she glanced indifferently at the portrait \nand gave her attention chiefly to the box for \ncards. \n\n"Thank you, my dear, you have cheered me \nup/' said she as she always did. "But best of \nall you have brought yourself back for I never \nsaw anything like it, you ought to give your \nwife a scolding! What are we to do with her? \nShe is like a mad woman when you are away. \nDoesn't see anything, doesn't remember any- \nthing," she went on, repeating her usual \nphrases. "Look, Anna Timofevna,"she added \nto her companion, "see what a box for cards \nmy son has brought usl" \n\nBelova admired the presents and was de- \nlighted with her dress material. \n\nThough Pierre, Natdsha, Nicholas, Countess \nMary, and Denfsov had much to talk about \nthat they could not discuss before the old \ncountess not that anything was hidden from \nher, but because she had dropped so far be- \nhindhand in many things that had they begun \nto converse in her presence they would have \nhad to answer inopportune questions and to \nrepeat what they had already told her many \ntimes: that so-and-so was dead and so-and-so \nwas married, which she would again be unable \nto remember yet they sat at tea round the \nsamovar in the drawing room from habit, and \nPierre answered the countess' questions as to \nwhether Prince Vasili had aged and whether \nCountess Mary Alexdevna had sent greetings \nand still thought of them, arid other matters \nthat interested no one and to which she herself \nwas indifferent. \n\nConversation of this kind, interesting to no \none yet unavoidable, continued all through \nteatime. All the grown-up members of the fam- \nily were assembled near the round tea table at \nwhich S6nya presided beside the samovar. The \nchildren with their tutors and governesses had \nhad tea and their voices were audible from the \nnext room. At tea all sat in their accustomed \nplaces: Nicholas beside the stove at a small ta- \nble where his tea was handed to him; Milka,the \n\n\n\nold gray borzoi bitch (daughter of the first MU- \nka), with a quite gray face and large black eyes \nthat seemed more prominent than ever, lay on \nthe armchair beside him; Denfsov, whose curly \nhair, mustache, and whiskers had turned half \ngray, sa t beside Coun tess Mary wi th his general's \ntunic unbuttoned; Pierre sat between his wife \nand the old countess. He spoke of what heknew \nmight interest the old lady and that she could \nunderstand. He told her of external social \nevents and of the people who had formed the \ncircle of her contemporaries and had once been \na real, living, and distinct group, but who were \nnow for the most part scattered about the world \nand like herself were garnering the last ears of \nthe harvests they had sown in earlier years. But \nto the old countess those contemporaries of \nhers seemed to be the only serious and real so- \nciety. Natasha saw by Pierre's animation that \nhis visit had been interesting and that he had \nmuch to tell them but dare not say it before \nthe old countess. Denisov, not being a member \nof the family, did not understand Pierre's cau- \ntion and being, as a malcontent, much inter- \nested in what was occurring in Petersburg, \nkept urging Pierre to tell them about what had \nhappened in the Semenovsk regiment, then \nabout Arakchdev, and then about the Bible \nSociety. Once or twice Pierre was carried away \nand began to speak of these things, but Nicho- \nlas and Natasha always brought him back to \nthe health of Prince Ivdn and Countess Mary \nAlexdevna. \n\n"Well, and all this idiocy Gossner and Ta- \ntwinova?" Denfsov asked. "Is that weally still \ngoing on?" \n\n"Going on?" Pierre exclaimed. "Why more \nthan everl The Bible Society is the whole gov- \nernment now!" \n\n"What is that, mon cher ami?" asked the \ncountess, who had finished her tea and evident- \nly needed a pretext for being angry after her \nmeal. "What are you saying about the govern- \nment? I don't understand." \n\n"Well, you know, Maman," Nicholas inter- \nposed, knowing how to translate things into \nhis mother's language, "Prince Alexander Golf- \ntsyn has founded a society and in consequence \nhas great influence, they say." \n\n"Arakche'ev and Golftsyn," incautiously re- \nmarked Pierre, "are now the whole govern- \nment! And what a government! They see trea- \nson everywhere and are afraid of everything." \n\n"Well, and how is Prince Alexander to \nblame? He is a most estimable man. I used to \nmeet him at Mary Ant6novna's," said the \n\n\n\nFIRST EPILOGUE \n\ncountess in an offended tone; and still more \noffended that they all remained silent, she \nwent on: "Nowadays everyone finds fault. A \nGospel Society! Well, and what harm is there \nin that?" and she rose (everybody else got up \ntoo) and with a severe expression sailed back \nto her table in the sitting room. \n\nThe melancholy silence that followed was \nbroken by the sounds of the children's voices \nand laughter from the next room. Evidently \nsome jolly excitement was going on there. \n\n"Finished, finished!" little Natasha's gleeful \nyell rose above them all. \n\nPierre exchanged glances with Countess \nMary and Nicholas (Natasha he never lost \nsight of) and smiled happily. \n\n"That's delightful music!" said he. \n\n"It means that Anna Makarovna has finished \nher stocking," said Countess Mary. \n\n"Oh, I'll go and see," said Pierre, jumping \nup. "You know," he added, stopping at the \ndoor, "why I'm especially fond of that music? \nIt is always the first thing that tells me all is \nwell. When I was driving here today, the nearer \nI got to the house the more anxious I grew. As \nI entered the anteroom I heard Andnisha's \npeals of laughter and that meant that all was \nwell." \n\n"I know! I know that feeling," said Nicho- \nlas. "But I mustn't go there those stockings \nare to be a surprise for me." \n\nPierre went to the children, and the shout- \ning and laughter grew still louder. \n\n"Come, Anna Makdrovna," Pierre's voice \nwas heard saying, "come here into the middle \nof the room and at the word of command, 'One, \ntwo/ and when I say 'three' . . . You stand here, \nand you in my arms well now! One, two! . . ." \nsaid Pierre, and a silence followed: "three!" \nand a rapturously breathless cry of children's \nvoices filled the room. "Two, two!" they \nshouted. \n\nThis meant two stockings, which by a secret \nprocess known only to herself Anna Makrov- \nna used to knit at the same time on the same \nneedles, and which, when they were ready, she \nalways triumphantly drew, one out of the oth- \ner, in the children's presence. \n\n\n\n667 \n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV \n\nSOON AFTER THIS the children came in to say \ngood night. They kissed everyone, the tutors \nand governesses made their bows, and they \nwent out. Only young Nicholas and his tutor \nremained. Dessalles whispered to the boy to \ncome downstairs. \n\n\n\n"No, Monsieur Dessalles, I will ask my aunt \nto let me stay," replied Nicholas Bolkonski al- \nso in a whisper. \n\n"Ma tante, please let me stay," said he, go- \ning up to his aunt. \n\nHis face expressed entreaty, agitation, and \necstasy. Countess Mary glanced at him and \nturned to Pierre. \n\n"When you are here he can't tear himself \naway," she said. \n\n"I will bring him to you directly, Monsieur \nDessalles. Good night!" said Pierre, giving his \nhand to the Swiss tutor, and he turned to \nyoung Nicholas with a smile. "You and I \nhaven't seen anything of one another yet. . . . \nHow like he is growing, Mary!" he added, ad- \ndressing Countess Mary. \n\n"Like my father?" asked the boy, flushing \ncrimson and looking up at Pierre with bright, \necstatic eyes. \n\nPierre nodded, and went on with what he \nhad been saying when the children had inter- \nrupted. Countess Mary sat down doing wool- \nwork; Natasha did not take her eyes off her \nhusband. Nicholas and Dcnfsov rose, asked for \ntheir pipes, smoked, went to fetch more tea \nfrom Sonya who sat weary but resolute at the \nsamovar and questioned Pierre. The curly- \nheaded, delicate boy sat with shining eyes un- \nnoticed in a corner, starting every now and \nthen and muttering something to himself, and \nevidently experiencing a new and powerful \nemotion as he turned his curly head, with his \nthin neck exposed by his turn-down collar, to- \nward the place where Pierre sat. \n\nThe conversation turned on the contempo- \nrary gossip about those in power, in which \nmost people see the chief interest of home \npolitics. Denfsov, dissatisfied with the govern- \nment on account of his own disappointments \nin the service, heard with pleasure of the things \ndone in Petersburg which seemed to him stu- \npid, and made forcible and sharp comments \non what Pierre told them. \n\n"One used to have to be a German now one \nmust dance with Tatawinova and Madame \nKwiidener, and wead Ecka'tshausen and the \nbwethwen. Oh, they should let that fine fellow \nBonaparte lose he'd knock all this nonsense \nout of them! Fancy giving the command of the \nSemenov wegiment to a fellow like that \nSchwa'tz!" he cried. \n\nNicholas, though free from Denfsov's readi- \nness to find fault with everything, also thought \nthat discussion of the government was a very \nserious and weighty matter, and the fact that \n\n\n\n668 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nA had been appointed Minister of This and \nB Governor General of That, and that the \nEmperor had said so-and-so and this minister \nso-and-so, seemed to him very important. And \nso he thought it necessary to take an interest \nin these things and to question Pierre. The \nquestions put by these two kept the conversa- \ntion from changing its ordinary character of \ngossip about the higher government circles. \n\nBut Natdsha, knowing all her husband's ways \nand ideas, saw that he had long been wishing \nbut had been unable to divert the conversa- \ntion to another channel and express his own \ndeeply felt idea for the sake of which he had \ngone to Petersburg to consult with his new \nfriend Prince Theodore, and she helped him \nby asking how his affairs with Prince Theodore \nhad gone. \n\n4 'What was it about?" asked Nicholas. \n\n"Always the same thing," said Pierre, look- \ning round at his listeners. "Everybody sees that \nthings are going so badly that they cannot be \nallowed to go on so and that it is the duty of all \ndecent men to counteract it as far as they can." \n\n"What can decent men do?" Nicholas in- \nquired, frowning slightly. "What can be done?" \n\n"Why, this . . ." \n\n"Come into my study," said Nicholas. \n\nNatdsha, who had long expected to be fetched \nto nurse her baby, now heard the nurse calling \nher and went to the nursery. Countess Mary \nfollowed her. The men went into the study \nand little Nicholas Bolk6nski followed them \nunnoticed by his uncle and sat down at the \nwriting table in a shady corner by the window. \n\n"Well, what would you do?" asked Denfsov. \n\n"Always some fantastic schemes," said Nich- \nolas. \n\n"Why this," began Pierre, not sitting down \nbut pacing the room, sometimes stopping short, \ngesticulating, and lisping: "the position in \nPetersburg is this: the Emperor does not look \ninto anything. He has abandoned himself alto- \ngether to this mysticism" (Pierre could not \ntolerate mysticism in anyone now). "He seeks \nonly for peace, and only these people sans foi \nni loi * can give it him people who recklessly \nhack at and strangle everything Magnftski, \nArakchev, and tutti quanti. . . . You will agree \nthat if you did not look after your estates your- \nself but only wanted a quiet life, the harsher \nyour steward was the more readily your object \nmight be attained," he said to Nicholas. \n\n"Well, what does that lead up to?" said \nNicholas. \n\n1 Without faith or law. \n\n\n\n"Well, everything is going to ruin! Robbery \nin the law courts, in the army nothing but \nflogging, drilling, and Military Settlements; \nthe people are tortured, enlightenment is sup- \npressed. All that is young and honest is crushed! \nEveryone sees that this cannot go on. Every- \nthing is strained to such a degree that it will \ncertainly break," said Pierre (as those who \nexamine the actions of any government have \nalways said since governments began). "I told \nthem just one thing in Petersburg." \n\n"Told whom?" \n\n"Well, you know whom," said Pierre, with a \nmeaning glance from under his brows. "Prince \nTheodore and all those. To encourage culture \nand philanthropy is all very well of course. \nThe aim is excellent but in the present cir- \ncumstances something else is needed." \n\nAt that moment Nicholas noticed the pres- \nence of his nephew. His face darkened and he \nwent up to the boy. \n\n"Why are you here?" \n\n"Why? Let him be," said Pierre, taking Nich- \nolas by the arm and continuing. "That is not \nenough, I told them. Something else is needed. \nWhen you stand expecting the overstrained \nstring to snap at any moment, when everyone \nis expecting the inevitable catastrophe, as \nmany as possible must join hands as closely as \nthey can to withstand the general calamity. \nEverything that is young and strong is being \nenticed away and depraved. One is lured by \nwomen, another by honors, a third by ambi- \ntion or money, and they go over to that camp. \nNo independent men, such as you or I, are left. \nWhat I say is widen the scope of our society, \nlet the mot d'ordre be not virtue alone but in- \ndependence and action as well!" \n\nNicholas, who had left his nephew, irritably \npushed up an armchair, sat down in it, and \nlistened to Pierre, coughing discontentedly and \nfrowning more and more. \n\n"But action with what aim?" he cried. "And \nwhat position will you adopt toward the gov- \nernment?" \n\n"Why, the position of assistants. The society \nneed not be secret if the government allows it. \nNot merely is it not hostile to government, but \nit is a society of true conservatives a society of \ngentlemen in the full meaning of that word. \nIt is only to prevent some Pugache*v or other \nfrom killing my children and yours,* and Arak- \nche*ev from sending me off to some Military \nSettlement. We join hands only for the public \n\n8 Pugachev was the Cossack leader of a great \npeasant rising in Catherine the Great's time. TR. \n\n\n\nFIRST EPILOGUE \n\n\n\nwelfare and the general safety." \n\n"Yes, but it's a secret society and therefore a \nhostile and harmful o;ie which can only cause \nharm." \n\n"Why? Did the Tugendbund which saved \nEurope" (they did not then venture to sug- \ngest that Russia had saved Europe) "do any \nharm? The Tugendbund is an alliance of vir- \ntue: it is love, mutual help ... it is what Christ \npreached on the Cross." \n\nNatdsha, who had come in during the con- \nversation, looked joyfully at her husband. It \nwas not what he was saying that pleased her \nthat did not even interest her, for it seemed to \nher that it was all extremelysimpleand thatshe \nhad known it a long time (it seemed so to her \nbecause she knew that it sprang from Pierre's \nwhole soul), but it was his animated and en- \nthusiastic appearance that made her glad. \n\nThe boy with the thin neck stretching out \nfrom the turn-down collar whom everyone \nhad forgotten ga/ed at Pierre with even great- \ner and more rapturous joy. Every word of \nPierre's burned into his heart, and with a \nnervous movement of his fingers he uncon- \nsciously broke the sealing wax and quill pens \nhis hands came upon on his uncle's table. \n\n"It is not at all what you suppose; but that \nis what the German Tugendbund was, and what \nI am proposing." \n\n"No, my fwiendl The Tugendbund is all \nvewy well for the sausage eaters, but I don't \nunderstand it and can't even pwonounce it," \ninterposed Denisov in a loud and resolute \nvoice. "I agwee that evewything here is wotten \nand howwible, but the Tugendbund I don't \nunderstand. If we're not satisfied, let us have a \nbunt of our own. 1 That's all wight. Je suis vot'e \nhomme!" * \n\nPierre smiled, Natdsha began to laugh, but \nNicholas knitted his brows still more and be- \ngan proving to Pierre that there was no pros- \npect of any great change and that all the dan- \nger he spoke of existed only in his imagina- \ntion. Pierre maintained the contrary, and as \nhis mental faculties were greater and more re- \nsourceful, Nicholas felt himself cornered. This \nmade him still angrier, for he was fully con- \nvinced, not by reasoning but by something \nwithin him stronger than reason, of the justice \nof his opinion. \n\n"I will tell you this," he said, rising and try- \n\n1 Denisov makes play with the similarity of the \nGerman word Bund, a union, and the Russian \nword bunt, a riot. TR. \n\n1 "I'm your man." \n\n\n\ning with nervously twitching fingers to prop \nup his pipe in a corner, but finally abandon- \ning the attempt. "I can't prove it to you. You \nsay that everything here is rotten and that an \noverthrow is coming: I don't see it. But you \nalso say that our oath of allegiance is a condi- \ntional matter, and to that I reply: 'You are \nmy best friend, as you know, but if you formed \na secret society and began working against the \ngovernment be it what it may I know it is \nmy duty to obey the government. And if Arak- \nchdev ordered me to lead a squadron against \nyou and cut you down, I should not hesitate \nan instant, but should do it.' And you may ar- \ngue about that as you like!" \n\nAn awkward silence followed these words. \nNatdsha was the first to speak, defending her \nhusband and attacking her brother. Her de- \nfense was weak and inapt but she attained her \nobject. The conversation was resumed, and no \nlonger in the unpleasantly hostile tone of \nNicholas* last remark. \n\nWhen they all got up to go in to supper, lit- \ntle Nicholas Bolkonski went up to Pierre, pale \nand with shining, radiant eyes. \n\n"Uncle Pierre, you ... no ... If Papa were \nalive . . . would he agree with you?" he asked. \n\nAnd Pierre suddenly realized what a special, \nindependent, complex, and powerful process \nof thought and feeling must have been going \non in this boy during that conversation, and \nremembering all he had said he regretted that \nthe lad should have heard him. He had, how- \never, to give him an answer. \n\n"Yes, I think so," he said reluctantly, and \nleft the study. \n\nThe lad looked down and seemed now for \nthe first time to notice what he had done to the \nthings on the table. He flushed and went up \nto Nicholas. \n\n"Uncle, forgive me, I did that . . . uninten- \ntionally," he said, pointing to the broken seal- \ning wax and pens. \n\nNicholas started angrily. \n\n"All right, all right," he said, throwing the \nbits under the table. \n\nAnd evidently suppressing his vexation with \ndifficulty, he turned away from the boy. \n\n"You ought not to have been here at all," he \nsaid. \n\nCHAPTER XV \n\nTHE CONVERSATION at supper was not about \npolitics or societies, but turned on the subject \nNicholas liked best recollections of 1819. \nDenfsov started these and Pierre was particu- \n\n\n\n670 \n\nlarly agreeable and amusing about them. The \nfamily separated on the most friendly terms. \n\nAfter supper Nicholas, having undressed in \nhis study and given instructions to the steward \nwho had been waiting for him, went to the \nbedroom in his dressing gown, where he found \nhis wife still at her table, writing. \n\n"What are you writing, Mary?" Nicholas \nasked. \n\nCountess Mary blushed. She was afraid that \nwhat she was writing would not be understood \nor approved by her husband. \n\nShe had wanted to conceal what she was \nwriting from him, but at the same time was \nglad he had surprised her at it and that she \nwould now have to tell him. \n\n"A diary, Nicholas," she replied, handing \nhim a blue exercise book filled with her firm, \nbold writing. \n\n"A diary?" Nicholas repeated with a shade \nof irony, and he took up the book. \n\nIt was in French. \n\nDecember 4. Today when AndnVsha (her eldest \nlx&gt;y) woke up he did not wish to dress and Ma- \ndemoiselle Louise sent for me. He was naughty \nand obstinate. I tried threats, but he only grew \nangrier. Then I took the matter in hand: I left \nhim alone and began with nurse's help to get the \nother children up, telling him that I did not love \nhim. For a longtime he was silent. as if astonished, \nthen he jumped out of bed, ran to me in his shirt, \nand sobbed so that I could not calm him for a long \ntime. It was plain that what troubled him most \nwas that he had grieved me. Afterwards in the \nevening when I gave him his ticket, he again began \ncrying piteously and kissing me. One can do any- \nthing with him by tenderness. \n\n"What is a 'ticket'?" Nicholas inquired. \n\n"I have begun giving the elder ones marks \nevery evening, showing how they have be- \nhaved." \n\nNicholas looked into the radiant eyes that \nwere gazing at him, and continued to turn over \nthe pages and read. In the diary was set down \neverything in the children's lives that seemed \nnoteworthy to their mother as showing their \ncharacters or suggesting general reflections on \neducational methods. They were for the most \npart quite insignificant trifles, but did not seem \nso to the mother or to the father either, now \nthat he read this diary about his children for \nthe first time. \n\nUnder the date "5" was entered: \n\nMitya was naughty at table. Papa said he was to \nhave no pudding. He had none, but looked so un- \nhappily and greedily at the others while they were \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\neating! I think that punishment by depriving chil- \ndren o sweets only develops their greediness. Must \ntell Nicholas this. \n\nNicholas put down the book and looked at \nhis wife. The radiant eyes gazed at him ques- \ntioningly: would he approve or disapprove of \nher diary? There could be no doubt not only \nof his approval but also of his admiration for \nhis wife. \n\nPerhaps it need not be done so pedantically, \nthought Nicholas, or even done at all, but this \nuntiring, continual spiritual effort of which \nthe sole aim was the children's moral welfare \ndelighted him. Had Nicholas been able to ana- \nlyze his feelings he would have found that his \nsteady, tender, and proud love of his wife rested \non his feeling of wonder at her spirituality and \nat the lofty moral world, almost beyond his \nreach, in which she had her being. \n\nHe was proud of her intelligence and good- \nness, recognized his own insignificance beside \nher in the spiritual world, and rejoiced all the \nmore that she with such a soul not only be- \nlonged to him but was part of himself. \n\n"I quite, quite approve, my dearest!" said \nhe with a significant look, and after a short \npause he added: "And I behaved badly today. \nYou weren't in the study. We began disputing \nPierre and I and I lost my temper. But he is \nimpossible: such a child! I don't know what \nwould become of him if Natasha didn't keep \nhim in hand. . . . Have you any idea why he \nwent to Petersburg? They have formed . . ." \n\n"Yes, I know," said Countess Mary. "Nat- \nsha told me." \n\n"Well, then, you know," Nicholas went on, \ngrowing hot at the mere recollection of their \ndiscussion, "he wanted to convince me that it \nis every honest man's duty to go against the \ngovernment, and that the oath of allegiance \nand duty ... I am sorry you weren't there. \nThey all fell on me Denfsov and Natasha . . . \nNatasha is absurd. How she rules over him! \nAnd yet there need only be a discussion and \nshe has no words of her own but only repeats \nhis sayings . . ." added Nicholas, yielding to \nthat irresistible inclination which tempts us to \njudge those nearest and dearest to us. He forgot \nthat what he was saying about Natdsha could \nhave been applied word for word to himself in \nrelation to his wife. \n\n"Yes, I have noticed that," said Countess \nMary. \n\n"When I told him that duty and the oath \nwere above everything, he started proving \ngoodness knows what! A pity you were not \n\n\n\nFIRST EPILOGUE \n\n\n\n671 \n\n\n\nthere what would you have said?" \n\n"As I see it you were quite right, and I told \nNatasha so. Pierre says everybody is suffering, \ntortured, and being corrupted, and that it is \nour duty to help our neighbor. Of course he is \nright there," said Countess Mary, "but he for- \ngets that we have other duties nearer to us, \nduties indicated to us by God Himself, and \nthat though we might expose ourselves to risks \nwe must not risk our children." \n\n"Yes, that's itl That's just what I said to \nhim," put in Nicholas, who fancied he really \nhad said it. "But they insisted on their own \nview: love of one's neighbor and Christianity \nand all this in the presence of young Nich- \nolas, who had gone into my study and broke \nall my things." \n\n"Ah, Nicholas, do you know I am often \ntroubled about little Nicholas," said Countess \nMary. "He is such an exceptional boy. I am \nafraid I neglect him in favor of my own: we \nall have children and relations while he has no \none. He is constantly alone with his thoughts." \n\n"Well, I don't think you need reproach \nyourself on his account. All that the fondest \nmother could do for her son you have done \nand are doing for him, and of course I am glad \nof it. He is a fine lad, a fine ladl This evening \nhe listened to Pierre in a sort of trance, and \nfancy as we were going in to supper I looked \nand he had broken everything on my table to \nbits, and he told me of it himself at once! I \nnever knew him to tell an untruth. A fine lad, \na fine ladl" repeated Nicholas, who at heart \nwas not fond of Nicholas Bolk6nski but was \nalways anxious to recognize that he was a fine \nlad. \n\n"Still, I am not the same as his own mother," \nsaid Countess Mary. "I feel I am not the same \nand it troubles me. A wonderful boy, but I am \ndreadfully afraid for him. It would be good for \nhim to have companions." \n\n"Well it won't be for long. Next summer I'll \ntake him to Petersburg," said Nicholas. "Yes, \nPierre always was a dreamer and always will \nbe," he continued, returning to the talk in the \nstudy which had evidently disturbed him. \n"Well, what business is it of mine what goes on \ntherewhether Arakche'ev is bad, and all that? \nWhat business was it of mine when I married \nand was so deep in debt that I was threatened \nwith prison, and had a mother who could not \nsee or understand it? And then there are you \nand the children and our affairs. Is it for my \nown pleasure that I am at the farm or in the \noffice from morning to night? No, but I know \n\n\n\nI must work to comfort my mother, to repay \nyou, and not to leave the children such beggars \nas I was." \n\nCountess Mary wanted to tell him that man \ndoes not live by bread alone and that he at- \ntached too much importance to these matters. \nBut she knew she must not say this and that it \nwould be useless to do so. She only took his \nhand and kissed it. He took this as a sign of ap- \nproval and a confirmation of his thoughts, and \nafter a few minutes' reflection continued to \nthink aloud. \n\n"You know, Mary, today Elias Mitrofinych" \n(this was his overseer) "came back from the \nTamb6v estate and told me they are already \noffering eighty thousand rubles for the forest." \n\nAnd with an eager face Nicholas began to \nspeak of the possibility of repurchasing Otrad- \nnoe before long, and added: "Another ten \nyears of life and I shall leave the children . . . \nin an excellent position." \n\nCountess Mary listened to her husband and \nunderstood all that he told her. She knew that \nwhen he thought aloud in this way he would \nsometimes ask her what he had been saying, \nand be vexed if he noticed that she had been \nthinking about something else. But she had to \nforce herself to attend, for what he was saying \ndid not interest her at all. She looked at him \nand did not think, but felt, about something \ndifferent. She felt a submissive tender love for \nthis man who would never understand all that \nshe understood, and this seemed to make her \nlove for him still stronger and added a touch \nof passionate tenderness. Besides this feeling \nwhich absorbed her altogether and hindered \nher from following the details of her husband's \nplans, thoughts that had no connection with \nwhat he was saying flitted through her mind. \nShe thought of her nephew. Her husband's ac- \ncount of the boy's agitation while Pierre was \nspeaking struck her forcibly, and various traits \nof his gentle, sensitive character recurred to \nher mind; and while thinking of her nephew \nshe thought also of her own Children. She did \nnot compare them with him, but compared \nher feeling for them with her feeling for him, \nand felt with regret that there was something \nlacking in her feeling for young Nicholas. \n\nSometimes it seemed to her that this differ- \nence arose from the difference in their ages, \nbut she felt herself to blame toward him and \npromised in her heart to do better and to ac- \ncomplish the impossible in this life to love \nher husband, her children, little Nicholas, and \nall her neighbors, as Christ loved mankind. \n\n\n\n67* \n\nCountess Mary's soul always strove toward the \ninfinite, the eternal, and the absolute, and \ncould therefore never be at peace. A stern ex- \npression of the lofty, secret suffering of a soul \nburdened by the, body appeared on her face. \nNicholas gazed a* her. "O God! What will be- \ncome of us if she dies, as I always fear when \nher face is like that?" thought he, and placing \nhimself before the icon he began to say his \nevening prayers. \n\nCHAPTER XVI \n\nNATASHA AND PIERRE, left alone, also began to \ntalk as only a husband and wife can talk, that \nis, with extraordinary clearness and rapidity, \nunderstanding and expressing each other's \nthoughts in ways contrary to all rules of logic, \nwithout premises, deductions, or conclusions, \nand in a quite peculiar way. Natasha was so \nused to this kind of talk with her husband that \nfor her it was the surest sign of something be- \ning wrong between them if Pierre followed a \nline of logical reasoning. When he began prov- \ning anything, or talking argumentatively and \ncalmly and she, led on by his example, began \nto do the same, she knew that they were on the \nverge of a quarrel. \n\nFrom the moment they were alone and Na- \ntdsha came up to him with wide-open happy \neyes, and quickly seizing his head pressed it to \nher bosom, saying: "Now you are all mine, \nmine! You won't escape! "from that moment \nthis conversation began, contrary to all the \nlaws of logic and contrary to them because \nquite different subjects were talked about at \none and the same time. This simultaneous dis- \ncussion of many topics did not prevent a clear \nunderstanding but on the contrary was the \nsurest sign that they fully understood one an- \nother. \n\nJust as in a dream when all is uncertain, un- \nreasoning, and contradictory, except the feel- \ning that guides the dream, so in this inter- \ncourse contrary to all laws of reason, the words \nthemselves were not consecutive and clear but \nonly the feeling that prompted them. \n\nNatasha spoke to Pierre about her brother's \nlife and doings, of how she had suffered and \nlacked life during his own absence, and of how \nshe was fonder than ever of Mary, and how \nMary was in every way better than herself. In \nsaying this Natdsha was sincere in acknowl- \nedging Mary's superiority, but at the same time \nby saying it she made a demand on Pierre that \nhe should, all the same, prefer her to Mary and \nto all other women, and that now, especially \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\nafter having seen many women in Petersburg, \nhe should tell her so afresh. \n\nPierre, answering Natasha's words, told her \nhow intolerable it had been for him to meet \nladies at dinners and balls in Petersburg. \n\n"I have quite lost the knack of talking to \nladies," he said. "It was simply dull. Besides, I \nwas very busy." \n\nNatdsha looked intently at him and went \non: \n\n"Mary is so splendid," she said. "How she \nunderstands children! It is as if she saw straight \ninto their souls. Yesterday, for instance, Mitya \nwas naughty ..." \n\n"How like his father he is," Pierre inter- \njected. \n\nNatasha knew why he mentioned Mitya's \nlikeness to Nicholas: the recollection of his dis- \npute with his brother-in-law was unpleasant \nand he wanted to know what Natdsha thought \nof it. \n\n"Nicholas has the weakness of never agree- \ning with anything not generally accepted. But \nI understand that you value what opens up a \nfresh line," said she, repeating words Pierre \nhad once uttered. \n\n"No, the chief point is that to Nicholas \nideas and discussions are an amusemental- \nmost a pastime," said Pierre. "For instance, he \nis collecting a library and has made it a rule \nnot to buy a new book till he has read what he \nhad already bought Sismondi and Rousseau \nand Montesquieu," he added with a smile. \n"You know how much I ..." he began to soften \ndown what he had said; but Natdsha inter- \nrupted him to show that this was unnecessary. \n\n"So you say ideas are an amusement to \nhim. . . ." \n\n"Yes, and for me nothing else is serious. AH \nthe time in Petersburg I saw everyone as in a \ndream. When I am taken up by a thought, all \nelse is mere amusement." \n\n"Ah, I'm so sorry I wasn't there when you \nmet the children," said Natdsha. "Which was \nmost delighted? Lisa, I'm sure." \n\n"Yes," Pierre replied, and went on with \nwhat was in his mind. "Nicholas says we ought \nnot to think. But I can't help it. Besides, when \nI was in Petersburg I felt (I can say this to you) \nthat the whole affair would go to pieces with- \nout meeveryone was pulling his own way. \nBut I succeeded in uniting them all; and then \nmy idea is so clear and simple. You see, I don't \nsay that we ought to oppose this and that. We \nmay be mistaken. What I say is: 'Join hands, \nyou who love the right, and let there be but \n\n\n\nFIRST EPILOGUE \n\n\n\n673 \n\n\n\none banner that of active virtue/ Prince Ser- \ngy is a fine fellow and clever." \n\nNatasha would have had no doubt as to the \ngreatness of Pierre's idea, but one thing dis- \nconcerted her. "Can a man so important and \nnecessary to society be also my husband? How \ndid this happen?" She wished to express this \ndoubt to him. "Now who could decide whether \nhe is really cleverer than all the others?" she \nasked herself, and passed in review all those \nwhom Pierre most respected. Judging by what \nhe had said there was no one he had respected \nso highly as Plat6n Karataev. \n\n"Do you know what I am thinking about?" \nshe asked. "About Plat6n Karataev. Would he \nhave approved of you now, do you think?" \n\nPierre was not at all surprised at this ques- \ntion. He understood his wife's line of thought. \n\n"Plat6n Karatdev?" he repeated, and pon- \ndered, evidently sincerely trying to imagine \nKaratiev's opinion on the subject. "He would \nnot have understood . . .yet perhaps he would." \n\n"I love you awfully!" Natdsha suddenly said. \n"Awfully, awfully!" \n\n"No, he would not have approved," said \nPierre, after reflection. "What he would have \napproved of is our family life. He was always \nso anxious to find seemliness, happiness, and \npeace in everything, and I should have been \nproud to let him see us. There nowyou talk \nof my absence, but you wouldn't believe what \na special feeling I have for you after a separa- \ntion. . . ." \n\n"Yes, I should think . . ." Natasha began. \n\n"No, it's not that. I never leave off loving \nyou. And one couldn't love more, but this is \nsomething special. . . . Yes, of course" he did \nnot finish because their eyes meeting said the \nrest. \n\n"What nonsense it is," Natdsha suddenly ex- \nclaimed, "about honeymoons, and that the \ngreatest happiness is at first! On the contrary, \nnow is the best of all. If only you did not go \naway! Do you remember how we quarreled? \nAnd it was always my fault. Always mine. And \nwhat we quarreled about I don't even remem- \nber!" \n\n"Always about the same thing," said Pierre \nwith a smile. "Jealo . . ." \n\n"Don't say it! I can't bear it!" Natdsha cried, \nand her eyes glittered coldly and vindictively. \n"Did you see her?" she added, after a pause. \n\n"No, and if I had I shouldn't have recog- \nnized her." \n\nThey were silent for a while. \n\n"Oh, do you know? While you were talking \n\n\n\nin the study I was looking at you," Natdsha \nbegan, evidently anxious to disperse the cloud \nthat had come over them. "You are as like him \nas two peas like the boy." (She meant her lit- \ntle son.) "Oh, it's time to go to him. . . . The \nmilk's come. . . . But I'm sorry to leave you." \n\nThey were silent for a few seconds. Then \nsuddenly turning to one another at the same \ntime they both began to speak. Pierre began \nwith self-satisfaction and enthusiasm, Natasha \nwith a quiet, happy smile. Having interrupted \none another they both stopped to let the other \ncontinue. \n\n"No. What did you say? Go on, go on." \n\n"No, you go on, I was talking nonsense," \nsaid Natasha. \n\nPierre finished what he had begun. It was \nthe sequel to his complacent reflections on his \nsuccess in Petersburg. At that moment it seemed \nto him that he was chosen to give a new direc- \ntion to the whole of Russian society and to the \nwhole world. \n\n"I only wished to say that ideas that have \ngreat results are always simple ones. My whole \nidea is that if vicious people are united and \nconstitute a power, then honest folk must do \nthe same. Now that's simple enough." \n\n"Yes." \n\n"And what were you going to say?" \n\n"I? Only nonsense." \n\n"But all the same?" \n\n"Oh nothing, only a trifle," said Natdsha, \nsmiling still more brightly. "I only wanted to \ntell you about Ptya: today nurse was coming \nto take him from me, and he laughed, shut his \neyes, and clung to me. I'm sure he thought he \nwas hiding. Awfully sweet! There, now he's \ncrying. Well, good-by!" and she left the room. \n\nMeanwhile downstairs in young Nicholas \nBolk6nski's bedroom a little lamp was burn- \ning as usual. (The boy was afraid of the dark \nand they could not cure him of it.) Dessalles \nslept propped up on four pillows and his \nRoman nose emitted sounds of rhythmic snor- \ning. Little Nicholas, who had just waked up in \na cold perspiration, sat up in bed and gazed be- \nfore him with wide-open eyes. He had awaked \nfrom a terrible dream. He had dreamed that \nhe and Uncle Pierre, wearing helmets such as \nwere depicted in his Plutarch, were leading a \nhuge army. The army was made up of white \nslanting lines that filled the air like the cob- \nwebs that float about in autumn and which \nDessalles called Ics fils dc la Vitrgc. In front \nwas Glory, which was similar to those threads \n\n\n\n674 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nbut rather thicker. He and Pierre were borne \nalong lightly and joyously, nearer and nearer \nto their goal. Suddenly the threads that moved \nthem began to slacken and become entangled \nand it grew difficult to move. And Uncle Nich- \nolas stood before them in a stern and threaten- \ning attitude. \n\n"Have you done this?" he said, pointing to \nsome broken sealing wax and pens. "I loved \nyou, but I have orders from Arakche*ev and \nwill kill the first of you who moves forward." \nLittle Nicholas turned to look at Pierre but \nPierre was no longer there. In his place was \nhis father Prince Andrew and his father had \nneither shape nor form, but he existed, and \nwhen little Nicholas perceived him he grew \nfaint with love: he felt himself powerless, limp, \nand formless. His father caressed and pitied \nhim. But Uncle Nicholas came nearer and \nnearer to them. Terror seized young Nicholas \nand he awoke. \n\n"My father!" he thought. (Though there \nwere two good portraits of Prince Andrew in \nthe house, Nicholas never imagined him in hu- \n\n\n\nman form.) "My father has been with me and \ncaressed me. He approved of me and of Uncle \nPierre. Whatever he may tell me, I will do it. \nMucius Scaevola burned his hand. Why should \nnot the same sort of thing happen to me? I \nknow they want me to learn. And I will learn, \nBut someday I shall have finished learning, \nand then I will do something. I only pray God \nthat something may happen to me such as hap- \npened to Plutarch's men, and I will act as they \ndid. I will do better. Everyone shall know me, \nlove me, and be delighted with me!" And sud- \ndenly his bosom heaved with sobs and he be- \ngan to cry. \n\n"Are you ill?" he heard Dessalles' voice ask- \ning. \n\n"No," answered Nicholas, and lay back on \nhis pillow. \n\n"He is good and kind and I am fond of \nhim!" he thought of Dessalles. "But Uncle \nPierre! Oh, what a wonderful man he is! And \nmy father? Oh, Father, Father! Yes, 1 will do \nsomething with which even he would be satis- \nfied. . . ." \n\n\n\nSecond Epilogue \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I \n\nHISTORY is the life of nations and of humanity. \nTo seize and put into words, to describe di- \nrectly the life of humanity or even of a single \nnation, appears impossible. \n\nThe ancient historians all employed one \nand the same method to describe and seize \nthe apparently elusivethe life of a people. \nThey described the activity of individuals who \nruled the people, and regarded the activity \nof those men as representing the activity of the \nwhole nation. \n\nThe question: how did individuals make na- \ntions act as they wished and by what was the \nwill of these individuals themselves guided? the \nancients met by recognizing a divinity which \nsubjected the nations to the will of a chosen \nman, and guided the will of that chosen man so \nas to accomplish ends that were predestined. \n\nFor the ancients these questions were solved \nby a belief in the direct participation of the \nDeity in human affairs. \n\nModern history, in theory, rejects both these \nprinciples. \n\nIt would seem that having rejected the be- \nlief of the ancients in man's subjection to the \nDeity and in a predetermined aim toward \nwhich nations are led, modern history should \nstudy not the manifestations of power but the \ncauses that produce it. But modern history \nhas not done this. Having in theory rejected \nthe view held by the ancients, it still follows \nthem in practice. \n\nInstead of men endowed with divine author- \nity and directly guided by the will of God, \nmodern history has given us either heroes en- \ndowed with extraordinary, superhuman capac- \nities, or simply men of very various kinds, from \nmonarchs to journalists, who lead the masses. \nInstead of the former divinely appointed aims \nof the Jewish, Greek, or Roman nations, which \nancient historians regarded as representing the \nprogress of humanity, modern history has \npostulated its own aims the welfare of the \nFrench, German, or English people, or, in its \n\n\n\nhighest abstraction, the welfare and civiliza- \ntion of humanity in general, by which is usu- \nally meant that of the peoples occupying a \nsmall northwesterly portion of a large con- \ntinent. \n\nModern history has rejected the beliefs of \nthe ancients without replacing them by a new \nconception, and the logic of the situation has \nobliged the historians, after they had appar- \nently rejected the divine authority of the kings \nand the "fate" of the ancients, to reach the \nsame conclusion by another road, that is, to \nrecognize (i) nations guided by individual \nmen, and (2) the existence of a known aim \nto which these nations and humanity at large \nare tending. \n\nAt the basis of the works of all the modern \nhistorians from Gibbon to Buckle, despite \ntheir seeming disagreements and the appar- \nent novelty of their outlooks, lie those two old, \nunavoidable assumptions. \n\nIn the first place the historian describes the \nactivity of individuals who in his opinion have \ndirected humanity (one historian considers \nonly monarchs, generals, and ministers as be- \ning such men, while another includes also \norators, learned men, reformers, philosophers, \nand poets). Secondly, it is assumed that the \ngoal toward which humanity is being led is \nknown to the historians: to one of them this \ngoal is the greatness of the Roman, Spanish, \nor French realm; to another it is liberty, equal- \nity, and a certain kind of civilization of a small \ncorner of the world called Europe. \n\nIn 1789 a ferment arises in Paris; it grows, \nspreads, and is expressed by a movement of \npeoples from west to east. Several times it \nmoves eastward and collides with a counter- \nmovement from the east westward. In 18 is it \nreaches its extreme limit, Moscow, and then, \nwith remarkable symmetry, a countermove- \nment occurs from east to west, attracting to it, \nas the first movement had done, the nations of \nmiddle Europe. The countermovement reaches \nthe starting point of the first movement in the \n\n\n\n675 \n\n\n\n676 \n\nwest Paris and subsides. \n\nDuring that twenty-year period an immense \nnumber of fields were left untilled, houses \nwere burned, trade changed its direction, mil- \nlions of men migrated, were impoverished, or \nwere enriched, and millions of Christian men \nprofessing the law of love of their fellows slew \none another. \n\nWhat does all this mean? Why did it hap- \npen? What made those people burn houses \nand slay their fellow men? What were the \ncauses of these events? What force made men \nact so? These are the instinctive, plain, and \nmost legitimate questions humanity asks it- \nself when it encounters the monuments and \ntradition of that period. \n\nFor a reply to these questions the common \nsense of mankind turns to the science of his- \ntory, whose aim is to enable nations and hu- \nmanity to know themselves. \n\nIf history had retained the conception of \nthe ancients it would have said that God, to \nreward or punish his people, gave Napoleon \npower and directed his will to the fulfillment \nof the divine ends, and that reply would have \nbeen clear and complete. One might believe \nor disbelieve in the divine significance of Na- \npoleon, but for anyone believing in it there \nwould have been nothing unintelligible in the \nhistory of that period, nor would there have \nbeen any contradictions. \n\nBut modern history cannot give that reply. \nScience does not admit the conception of the \nancients as to the direct participation of the \nDeity in human affairs, and therefore history \nought to give other answers. \n\nModern history replying to these questions \nsays: you want to know what this movement \nmeans, what caused it, and what force pro- \nduced these events? Then listen: \n\n"Louis XIV was a very proud and self- \nconfident man; he had such and such mistresses \nand such and such ministers and he ruled \nFrance badly. His descendants were weak \nmen and they too ruled France badly. And \nthey had such and such favorites and such \nand such mistresses. Moreover, certain men \nwrote some books at that time. At the end of \nthe eighteenth century there were a couple of \ndozen men in Paris who began to talk about \nall men being free and equal. This caused \npeople all over France to begin to slash at and \ndrown one another. They killed the king and \nmany other people. At that time there was in \nFrance a man of genius Napoleon. He con- \nquered everybody everywhere that is, he \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nkilled many people because he was a great \ngenius. And for some reason he went to kill \nAfricans, and killed them so well and was so \ncunning and wise that when he returned to \nFrance he ordered everybody to obey him, and \nthey all obeyed him. Having become an Em- \nperor he again went out to kill people in Italy, \nAustria, and Prussia. And there too he killed a \ngreat many. In Russia there was an Emperor, \nAlexander, who decided to restore order in \nEurope and therefore fought against Napoleon. \nIn 1807 he suddenly made friends with him, \nbut in 1811 they again quarreled and again \nbegan killing many people. Napoleon led six \nhundred thousand men into Russia and cap- \ntured Moscow; then he suddenly ran away \nfrom Moscow, and the Emperor Alexander, \nhelped by the advice of Stein and others, \nunited Europe to arm against the disturber \nof its peace. All Napoleon's allies suddenly \nbecame his enemies and their forces advanced \nagainst the fresh forces he raised. The Allies \ndefeated Napoleon, entered Paris, forced Na- \npoleon to abdicate, and sent him to the island \nof Elba, not depriving him of the title of Em- \nperor and showing him every respect, though \nfive years before and one year later they all \nregarded him as an outlaw and a brigand. \nThen Louis XVIII, who till then had been the \nlaughingstock both of the French and the \nAllies, began to reign. And Napoleon, shed- \nding tears before his Old Guards, renounced \nthe throne and went into exile. Then the skill- \nful statesmen and diplomatists (especially \nTalleyrand, who managed to sit down in a \nparticular chair before anyone else and there- \nby extended the frontiers of France) talked \nin Vienna and by these conversations made \nthe nations happy or unhappy. Suddenly the \ndiplomatists and monarchs nearly quarreled \nand were on the point of again ordering their \narmies to kill one another, but just then Na- \npoleon arrived in France with a battalion, and \nthe French, who had been hating him, immedi- \nately all submitted to him. But the Allied \nmonarchs were angry at this and went to fight \nthe French once more. And they defeated the \ngenius Napoleon and, suddenly recognizing \nhim as a brigand, sent him to the island of St. \nHelena. And the exile, separated from the be- \nloved France so dear to his heart, died a lin- \ngering death on that rock and bequeathed his \ngreat deeds to posterity. But in Europe a reac- \ntion occurred and the sovereigns once again \nall began to oppress their subjects." \nIt would be a mistake to think that this is \n\n\n\nSECOND EPILOGUE \n\nironic a caricature of the historical accounts. \nOn the contrary it is a very mild expression of \nthe contradictory replies, not meeting the \nquestions, which all the historians give, from \nthe compilers of memoirs and the histories of \nseparate states to the writers of general his- \ntories and the new histories of the culture of \nthat period. \n\nThe strangeness and absurdity of these re- \nplies arise from the fact that modern history, \nlike a deaf man, answers questions no one has \nasked. \n\nIf the purpose of history be to give a descrip- \ntion of the movement of humanity and of the \npeoples, the first questionin the absence of \na reply to which all the rest will be incom- \nprehensible is: what is the power that moves \npeoples? To this, modern history laboriously \nreplies either that Napoleon was a great \ngenius, or that Louis XIV was very proud, or \nthat certain writers wrote certain books. \n\nAll that may be so and mankind is ready to \nagree with it, but it is not what was asked. \nAll that would be interesting if we recognized \na divine power based on itself and always con- \nsistently directing its nations through Napo- \nleons, Louis-es, and writers; but we do not \nacknowledge such a power, and therefore be- \nfore speaking about Napoleons, Louis-es, and \nauthors, we ought to be shown the connection \nexisting between these men and the movement \nof the nations. \n\nIf instead of a divine power some other \nforce has appeared, it should be explained in \nwhat this new force consists, for the whole in- \nterest of history lies precisely in that force. \n\nHistory seems to assume that this force is \nself-evident and known to everyone. But in \nspite of every desire to regard it as known, \nanyone reading many historical works cannot \nhelp doubting whether this new force, so vari- \nously understood by the historians themselves, \nis really quite well known to everybody. \n\n\n\n677 \n\n\n\nCHAPTER II \nWHAT FORCE moves the nations? \n\nBiographical historians and historians of \nseparate nations understand this force as a \npower inherent in heroes and rulers. In their \nnarration events occur solely by the will of a \nNapoleon, and Alexander, or in general of \nthe persons they describe. The answers given \nby this kind of historian to the question of \nwhat force causes events to happen are satis- \nfactory only as long as there is but one his- \ntorian to each event. As soon as historians of \n\n\n\ndifferent nationalities and tendencies begin to \ndescribe the same event, the replies they give \nimmediately lose all meaning, for this force \nis understood by them all not only differently \nbut often in quite contradictory ways. One \nhistorian says that an event was produced by \nNapoleon's power, another that it was pro- \nduced by Alexander's, a third that it was due \nto the power of some other person. Besides \nthis, historians of that kind contradict each \nother even in their statement as to the force \non which the authority of some particular per- \nson was based. Thiers, a Bonapartist, says that \nNapoleon's power was based on his virtue and \ngenius. Lanfrey, a Republican, says it was \nbased on his trickery and deception of the \npeople. So the historians of this class, by mutu- \nally destroying one another's positions, destroy \nthe understanding of the force which produces \nevents, and furnish no reply to history's essen- \ntial question. \n\nWriters of universal history who deal with \nall the nations seem to recognize how erro- \nneous is the specialist historians' view of the \nforce which produces events. They do not \nrecognize it as a power inherent in heroes and \nrulers, but as the resultant of a multiplicity of \nvariously directed forces. In describing a war \nor the subjugation of a people, a general his- \ntorian looks for the cause of the event not in \nthe power of one man, but in the interaction \nof many persons connected with the event. \n\nAccording to this view the power of histori- \ncal personages, represented as the product of \nmany forces, can no longer, it would seem, be \nregarded as a force that itself produces events. \nYet in most cases universal historians still em- \nploy the conception of power as a force that \nitself produces events, and treat it as their \ncause. In their exposition, an historic char- \nacter is first the product of his time, and his \npower only the resultant of various forces, and \nthen his power is itself a force producing \nevents. Gervinus, Schlosser, and others, for in- \nstance, at one time prove Napoleon to be a \nproduct of the Revolution, of the ideas of \n1789 and so forth, and at another plainly say \nthat the campaign of 1812 and other things \nthey do not like were simply the product of \nNapoleon's misdirected will, and that the very \nideas of 1789 were arrested in their develop- \nment by Napoleon's capricej The ideas of the \nRevolution and the general temper of the age \nproduced Napoleon's power. But Napoleon's \npower suppressed the ideas of the Revolution \nand the general temper of the age. \n\n\n\n678 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nThis curious contradiction is not accidental. \nNot only does it occur at every step, but the \nuniversal historians' accounts are all made up \nof a chain of such contradictions. This contra- \ndiction occurs because after entering the field \nof analysis the universal historians stop half- \nway. \n\nTo find component forces equal to the com- \nposite or resultant force, the sum of the com- \nponents must equal the resultant. This condi- \ntion is never observed by the universal his- \ntorians, and so to explain the resultant forces \nthey are obliged to admit, in addition to the \ninsufficient components, another unexplained \nforce affecting the resultant action. \n\nSpecialist historians describing the cam- \npaign of 1813 or the restoration of the Bour- \nbons plainly assert that these events were pro- \nduced by the will of Alexander. But the uni- \nversal historian Gervinus, refuting this opinion \nof the specialist historian, tries to prove that \nthe campaign of 1813 and the restoration of \nthe Bourbons were due to other things beside \nAlexander's willsuch as the activity of Stein, \nMetternich, Madame de Stael, Talleyrand, \nFichte, Chateaubriand, and others. The his- \ntorian evidently decomposes Alexander's pow- \ner into the components: Talleyrand, Chateau- \nbriand, and the rest but the sum of the com- \nponents, that is, the interactions of Chateau- \nbriand, Talleyrand, Madame de Stael, and \nthe others, evidently does not equal the result- \nant, namely the phenomenon of millions of \nFrenchmen submitting to the Bourbons. That \nChateaubriand, Madame de Stael, and others \nspoke certain words to one another only affect- \ned their mutual relations but does not account \nfor the submission of millions. And therefore \nto explain how from these relations of theirs \nthe submission of millions of people resulted \nthat is, how component forces equal to one \nA gave a resultant equal to a thousand times A \nthe historian is again obliged to fall back on \npower the force he had denied and to rec- \nognize it as the resultant of the forces, that is, \nhe has to admit an unexplained force acting \non the resultant. And that is just what the \nuniversal historians do, and consequently they \nnot only contradict the specialist historians \nbut contradict themselves. \n\nPeasants having no clear idea of the cause \nof rain, say, according to whether they want \nrain or fine weather: "The wind has blown \nthe clouds away," or, "The wind has brought \nup the clouds/' And in the same way the \nuniversal historians sometimes, when it pleases \n\n\n\nthem and fits in with their theory, say that \npower is the result of events, and sometimes, \nwhen they want to prove something else, say \nthat power produces events. \n\nA third class of historians the so-called his- \ntorians of culturefollowing the path laid \ndown by the universal historians who some- \ntimes accept writers and ladies as forces pro- \nducing events again take that force to be \nsomething quite different. They see it in what \nis called culture in mental activity. \n\nThe historians of culture are quite consist- \nent in regard to their progenitors, the writers \nof universal histories, for if historical events \nmay be explained by the fact that certain per- \nsons treated one another in such and such \nways, why not explain them by the fact that \nsuch and such people wrote such and such \nbooks? Of the immense number of indications \naccompanying every vital phenomenon, these \nhistorians select the indication of intellectual \nactivity and say that this indication is the cause. \nBut despite their endeavors to prove that the \ncause of events lies in intellectual activity, \nonly by a great stretch can one admit that \nthere is any connection between intellectual \nactivity and the movement of peoples, and in \nno case can one admit that intellectual activ- \nity controls people's actions, for that view is \nnot confirmed by such facts as the very cruel \nmurders of the French Revolution resulting \nfrom the doctrine of the equality of man, or \nthe very cruel wars and executions resulting \nfrom the preaching of love. \n\nBut even admitting as correct all the cun- \nningly devised arguments with which these \nhistories are filled admitting that nations \nare governed by some undefined force called \nan idea history's essential question still re- \nmains unanswered, and to the former power of \nmonarchs and to the influence of advisers and \nother people introduced by the universal his- \ntorians, another, newer force the idea is \nadded, the connection of which with the masses \nneeds explanation. It is possible to understand \nthat Napoleon had power and so events oc- \ncurred; with some effort one may even con- \nceive that Napoleon together with other in- \nfluences was the cause of an event; but how a \nbook, Le Contrat social, had the effect of mak- \ning Frenchmen begin to drown one another \ncannot be understood without an explana- \ntion of the causal nexus of this new force with \nthe event. \n\nUndoubtedly some relation exists between \nall who live contemporaneously, and so it is \n\n\n\nSECOND EPILOGUE \n\n\n\npossible to find some connection between the \nintellectual activity of men and their histori- \ncal movements, just as such a connection may \nbe found between the movements of human- \nity and commerce, handicraft, gardening, or \nanything else you please. But why intellectual \nactivity is considered by the historians of cul- \nture to be the cause or expression of the whole \nhistorical movement is hard to understand. \nOnly the following considerations can have \nled the historians to such a conclusion: (i) \nthat history is written by learned men, and so \nit is natural and agreeable for them to think \nthat the activity of their class supplies the \nbasis of the movement of all humanity, just \nas a similar belief is natural and agreeable to \ntraders, agriculturists, and soldiers (if they do \nnot express it, that is merely because traders \nand soldiers do not write history), and (2) that \nspiritual activity, enlightenment, civilization, \nculture, ideas, are all indistinct, indefinite con- \nceptions under whose banner it is very easy to \nuse words having a still less definite meaning, \nand which can therefore be readily introduced \ninto any theory. \n\nBut not to speak of the intrinsic quality of \nhistories of this kind (which may possibly even \nbe of use to someone for something) the his- \ntories of culture, to which all general histories \ntend more and more to approximate, are sig- \nnificant from the fact that after seriously and \nminutely examining various religious, philo- \nsophic, and political doctrines as causes of \nevents, as soon as they have to describe an ac- \ntual historic event such as the campaign of 1812 \nfor instance, they involuntarily describe it as \nresulting from an exercise of powerand say \nplainly that that campaign was the result of \nNapoleon's will. Speaking so, the historians of \nculture involuntarily contradict themselves, \nand show that the new force they have devised \ndoes not account for what happens in history, \nand that history can only be explained by in- \ntroducing a power which they apparently do \nnot recognize. \n\nCHAPTER III \n\nA LOCOMOTIVE is moving. Someone asks: "What \nmoves it?" A peasant says the devil moves it. \nAnother man says the locomotive moves be- \ncause its wheels go round. A third asserts that \nthe cause of its movement lies in the smoke \nwhich the wind carries away. \n\nThe peasant is irrefutable. He has devised \na complete explanation. To refute him some- \none would have to prove to him that there is \n\n\n\nno devil, or another peasant would have to \nexplain to him that it is not the devil but a \nGerman, who moves the locomotive. Only \nthen, as a result of the contradiction, will they \nsee that they are both wrong. But the man who \nsays that the movement of the wheels is the \ncause refutes himself, for having once begun \nto analyze he ought to go on and explain \nfurther why the wheels go round; and till he \nhas reached the ultimate cause of the move- \nment of the locomotive in the pressure of \nsteam in the boiler, he has no right to stop in \nhis search for the cause. The man who explains \nthe movement of the locomotive by the smoke \nthat is carried back has noticed that the wheels \ndo not supply an explanation and has taken \nthe first sign that occurs to him and in his turn \nhas offered that as an explanation. \n\nThe only conception that can explain the \nmovement of the locomotive is that of a force \ncommensurate with the movement observed. \n\nThe only conception that can explain the \nmovement of the peoples is that of some force \ncommensurate with the whole movement of \nthe peoples. \n\nYet to supply this conception various his- \ntorians take forces of different kinds, all of \nwhich are incommensurate with the movement \nobserved. Some see it as a force directly inher- \nent in heroes, as the peasant sees the devil in \nthe locomotive; others as a force resulting \nfrom several other forces, like the movement \nof the wheels; others again as an intellectual \ninfluence, like the smoke that is blown away. \n\nSo long as histories are written of separate \nindividuals, whether Caesars, Alexanders, \nLuthers, or Voltaires, and not the histories of \nall, absolutely all those who take part in an \nevent, it is quite impossible to describe the \nmovement of humanity without the concep- \ntion of a force compelling men to direct their \nactivity toward a certain end. And the only \nsuch conception known to historians is that \nof power. \n\nThis conception is the one handle by means \nof which the material of history, as at present \nexpounded, can be dealt with, and anyone \nwho breaks that handle off, as Buckle did, \nwithout finding some other method of treat- \ning historical material, merely deprives him- \nself of the one possible way of dealing with it. \nThe necessity of the conception of power as \nan explanation of historical events is best dem- \nonstrated by the universal historians and his- \ntorians of culture themselves, for they pro- \nfessedly reject that conception but inevitably \n\n\n\n68o \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nhave recourse to it at every step. \n\nIn dealing with humanity's inquiry, the \nscience of history up to now is like money in \ncirculation paper money and coin. The bi- \nographies and special national histories are \nlike paper money. They can be used and can \ncirculate and fulfill their purpose without \nharm to anyone and even advantageously, as \nlong as no one asks what is the security behind \nthem. You need only forget to ask how the \nwill of heroes produces events, and such his- \ntories as Thiers' will be interesting and in- \nstructive and may perhaps even possess a tinge \nof poetry. But just as doubts of the real value \nof paper money arise either because, being \neasy to make, too much of it gets made or be- \ncause people try to exchange it for gold, so \nalso doubts concerning the real value of such \nhistories arise either because too many of \nthem are written or because in his simplicity \nof heart someone inquires: by what force did \nNapoleon do this?that is, wants to exchange \nthe current paper money for the real gold of \nactual comprehension. \n\nThe writers of universal histories and of the \nhistory of culture are like people who, recog- \nnizing the defects of paper money, decide to \nsubstitute for it money made of metal that \nhas not the specific gravity of gold. It may in- \ndeed make jingling coin, but will do no more \nthan that. Paper money may deceive the ignor- \nant, but nobody is deceived by tokens of base \nmetal that have no value but merely jingle. \nAs gold is gold only if it is serviceable not \nmerely for exchange but also for use, so uni- \nversal historians will be valuable only when \nthey can reply to history's essential question: \nwhat is power? The universal historians give \ncontradictory replies to that question, while \nthe historians of culture evade it and answer \nsomething quite different. And as counters of \nimitation gold can be used only among a \ngroup of people who agree to accept them as \ngold, or among those who do not know the \nnature of gold, so universal historians and \nhistorians of culture, not answering human- \nity's essential question, serve as currency for \nsome purposes of their own, only in univer- \nsities and among the mass of readers who have \na taste for what they call "serious reading." \n\nCHAPTER IV \n\nHAVING ABANDONED the conception of the an- \ncients as to the divine subjection of the will of \na nation to some chosen man and the subjec- \ntion of that man's will to the Deity, history \n\n\n\ncannot without contradictions take a single \nstep till it has chosen one of two things: either \na return to the former belief in the direct in- \ntervention of the Deity in human affairs or a \ndefinite explanation of the meaning of the \nforce producing historical events and termed \n"power." \n\nA return to the first is impossible, the belief \nhas been destroyed; and so it is essential to \nexplain what is meant by power. \n\nNapoleon ordered an army to be raised and \ngo to war. We are so accustomed to that idea \nand have become so used to it that the ques- \ntion: why did six hundred thousand men go \nto fight when Napoleon uttered certain words, \nseems to us senseless. He had the power and \nso what he ordered was done. \n\nThis reply is quite satisfactory if we believe \nthat the power was given him by God. But as \nsoon as we do not admit that, it becomes es- \nsential to determine what is this power of one \nman over others. \n\nIt cannot be the direct physical power o a \nstrong man over a weak one a domination \nbased on the application or threat of physical \nforce, like the power of Hercules; nor can it \nbe based on the effect of moral force, as in \ntheir simplicity some historians think who say \nthat the leading figures in history are heroes, \nthat is, men gifted with a special strength of \nsoul and mind called genius. This power can- \nnot be based on the predominance of moral \nstrength, for, not to mention heroes such as \nNapoleon about whose moral qualities opin- \nions differ widely, history shows us that neither \na Louis XI nor a Metternich, who ruled over \nmillions of people, had any particular moral \nqualities, but on the contrary were generally \nmorally weaker than any of the millions they \nruled over. \n\nIf the source of power lies neither in the \nphysical nor in the moral qualities of him who \npossesses it, it must evidently be looked for \nelsewhere in the relation to the people of \nthe man who wields the power. \n\nAnd that is how power is understood by the \nscience of jurisprudence, that exchange bank \nof history which offers to exchange history's \nunderstanding of power for true gold, \nj Power is the collective will of the people \ntransferred, by expressed or tacit consent, to \ntheir chosen rulers. \n\n' In the domain of jurisprudence, which con- \nsists of discussions of how a state and power \nmight be arranged were it possible for all that \nto be arranged, it is all very clear; but when \n\n\n\nSECOND EPILOGUE \n\n\n\n681 \n\n\n\napplied to history that definition of power \nneeds explanation. \n\nThe science of jurisprudence regards the \nstate and power as the ancients regarded fire- \nnamely, as something existing absolutely. But \nfor history, the state and power are merely \nphenomena, just as for modern physics fire is \nnot an element but a phenomenon. \n\nFrom this fundamental difference between \nthe view held by history and that held by ju- \nrisprudence, it follows that jurisprudence can \ntell minutely how in its opinion power should \nbe constituted and what power existing im- \nmutably outside time is, but to history's ques- \ntions about the meaning of the mutations of \npower in time it can answer nothing. \n\nIf power be the collective will of the people \ntransferred to their ruler, was Pugachev a rep- \nresentative of the will of the people? If not, \nthen why was Napoleon I? Why was Napoleon \nIII a criminal when he was taken prisoner at \nBoulogne, and why, later on, were those crim- \ninals whom he arrested? \n\nDo palace revolutions in which sometimes \nonly two or three people take part transfer \nthe will of the people to a new ruler? In inter- \nnational relations, is the will of the people also \ntransferred to their conqueror? Was the will \nof the Confederation of the Rhine transferred \nto Napoleon in 1806? Was the will of the Rus- \nsian people transferred to Napoleon in 1809, \nwhen our army in alliance with the French \nwent to fight the Austrians? \n\nTo these questions three answers are pos- \nsible: \n\nEither to assume (i) that the will of the \npeople is always unconditionally transferred \nto the ruler or rulers they have chosen, and \nthat therefore every emergence of a new pow- \ner, every struggle against the power once ap- \npointed, should be absolutely regarded as an \ninfringement of the real power; or (2) that \nthe will of the people is transferred to the \nrulers conditionally, under definiteand known \nconditions, and to show that all limitations, \nconflicts, and even destructions of power re- \nsult from a nonobservance by the rulers of the \nconditions under which their power was en- \ntrusted to them; or (3) that the will of the \npeople is delegated to the rulers conditionally, \nbut that the conditions are unknown and in- \ndefinite, and that the appearance of several \nauthorities, their struggles and their falls, re- \nsult solely from the greater or lesser fulfill- \nment by the rulers of these unknown condi- \ntions on which the will of the people is trans- \n\n\n\nferred from some people to others. \n\nAnd these are the three ways in which the \nhistorians do explain the relation of the peo- \nple to their rulers. \n\nSome historians those biographical and \nspecialist historians already referred to in \ntheir simplicity failing to understand the ques- \ntion of the meaning of power, seem to consider \nthat the collective will of the people is uncon- \nditionally transferred to historical persons, and \ntherefore when describing some single state \nthey assume that particular power to be the \none absolute and real power, and that any \nother force opposing this is not a power but \na violation of power mere violence. \n\nTheir theory, suitable for primitive and \npeaceful periods of history, has the inconven- \niencein application to complex and stormy \nperiods in the life of nations during which \nvarious powers arise simultaneously and strug- \ngle with one another that a Legitimist his- \ntorian will prove that the National Conven- \ntion, the Directory, and Bonaparte were mere \ninfringers of the true power, while a Republi- \ncan and a Bonapartist will prove: the one that \nthe Convention and the other that the Empire \nwas the real power, and that all the others \nwere violations of power. Evidently the ex- \nplanations furnished by these historians being \nmutually contradictory can only satisfy young \nchildren. \n\nRecognizing the falsity of this view of his- \ntory, another set of historians say that power \nrests on a conditional delegation of the will \nof the people to their rulers, and that histori- \ncal leaders have power only conditionally on \ncarrying out the program that the will of the \npeople has by tacit agreement prescribed to \nthem. But what this program consists in these \nhistorians do not say, or if they do they con- \ntinually contradict one another. \n\nEach historian, according to his view of \nwhat constitutes a nation's progress, looks for \nthese conditions in the greatness, wealth, free- \ndom, or enlightenment of the citizens of France \nor some other country. But not to mention \nthe historians' contradictions as to the nature \nof this program or even admitting that some \none general program of these conditions exists \nthe facts of history almost always contradict \nthat theory. If the conditions under which \npower is entrusted consist in the wealth, free- \ndom, and enlightenment of the people, how \nis it that Louis XIV and Ivan the Terrible end \ntheir reigns tranquilly, while Louis XVI and \nCharles I are executed by their people? To \n\n\n\n682 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nthis question historians reply that Louis XIV's \nactivity, contrary to the program, reacted on \nLouis XVI. But why did it not react on Louis \nXIV or on Louis XV why should it react just \non Louis XVI? And what is the time limit for \nsuch reactions? To these questions there are \nand can be no answers. Equally little does this \nview explain why for several centuries the \ncollective will is not withdrawn from certain \nrulers and their heirs, and then suddenly dur- \ning a period of fifty years is transferred to the \nConvention, to the Directory, to Napoleon, to \nAlexander, to Louis XVIII, to Napoleon again, \nto Charles X, to Louis Philippe, to a Republi- \ncan government, and to Napoleon III. When \nexplaining these rapid transfers of the people's \nwill from one individual to another, especially \nin view of international relations, conquests, \nand alliances, the historians are obliged to \nadmit that some of these transfers are not \nnormal delegations of the people's will but are \naccidents dependent on cunning, on mistakes, \non craft, or on the weakness of a diplomatist, \na ruler, or a party leader. So that the greater \npart of the events of history civil wars, revolu- \ntions, and conquests are presented by these \nhistorians not as the results of free transfer- \nences of the people's will, but as results of the \nill-directed will of one or more individuals, \nthat is, once again, as usurpations of power. \nAnd so these historians also see and admit his- \ntorical events which are exceptions to the \ntheory. \n\nThese historians resemble a botanist who, \nhaving noticed that some plants grow from \nseeds producing two cotyledons, should insist \nthat all that grows does so by sprouting into \ntwo leaves, and that the palm, the mushroom, \nand even the oak, which blossom into full \ngrowth and no longer resemble two leaves, are \ndeviations from the theory. \n\nHistorians of the third class assume that the \nwill of the people is transferred to historic per- \nsonages conditionally, but that the conditions \nare unknown to us. They say that historical \npersonages have power only because they ful- \nfill the will of the people which has been dele- \ngated to them. \n\nBut in that case, if the force that moves na- \ntions lies not in the historic leaders but in the \nnations themselves, what significance have those \nleaders? \n\nThe leaders, these historians tell us, express \nthe will of the people: the activity of the lead- \ners represents the activity of the people. \n\nBut in that case the question arises whether \n\n\n\nall the activity of the leaders serves as an ex- \npression of the people's will or only some part \nof it. If the whole activity of the leaders serves \nas the expression of the people's will, as some \nhistorians suppose, then all the details of the \ncourt scandals contained in the biographies \nof a Napoleon or a Catherine serve to express \nthe life of the nation, which is evident non- \nsense; but if it is only some particular side of \nthe activity of an historical leader which serves \nto express the people's life, as other so-called \n"philosophical" historians believe, then to de- \ntermine which side of the activity of a leader \nexpresses the nation's life, we have first of all \nto know in what the nation's life consists. \n\nMet by this difficulty historians of that class \ndevise some most obscure, impalpable, and \ngeneral abstraction which can cover all con- \nceivable occurrences, and declare this abstrac- \ntion to be the aim of humanity's movement. \nThe most usual generalizations adopted by al- \nmost all the historians are: freedom, equality, \nenlightenment, progress, civilization, and cul- \nture. Postulating some generalization as the \ngoal of the movement of humanity, the his- \ntorians study the men of whom the greatest \nnumber of monuments have remained: kings, \nministers, generals, authors, reformers, popes, \nand journalists, to the extent to which in their \nopinion these persons have promoted or hin- \ndered that abstraction. But as it is in no way \nproved that the aim of humanity does consist \nin freedom, equality, enlightenment, or civil- \nization, and as the connection of the people \nwith the rulers and enlighteners of humanity \nis only based on the arbitrary assumption that \nthe collective will of the people is always trans- \nferred to the men whom we have noticed, it \nhappens that the activity of the millions who \nmigrate, burn houses, abandon agriculture, \nand destroy one another never is expressed in \nthe account of the activity of some dozen peo- \nple who did not burn houses, practice agricul- \nture, or slay their fellow creatures. \n\nHistory proves this at every turn. Is the fer- \nment of the peoples of the west at the end of \nthe eighteenth century and their drive east- \nward explained by the activity of Louis XIV, \nXV, and XVI, their mistresses and ministers, \nand by the lives of Napoleon, Rousseau, Did- \nerot, Beaumarchais, and others? \n\nIs the movement of the Russian people east- \nward to Kazan and Siberia expressed by details \nof the morbid character of Ivdn the Terrible \nand by his correspondence with Kurbski? \n\nIs the movement of the peoples at the time \n\n\n\nSECOND EPILOGUE \n\nof the Crusades explained by the life and \nactivity of the Godfreys and the Louis-es and \ntheir ladies? For us that movement of the \npeoples from west to east, without leaders, \nwith a crowd of vagrants, and with Peter the \nHermit, remains incomprehensible. And yet \nmore incomprehensible is the cessation of that \nmovement when a rational and sacred aim for \nthe Crusadethe deliverance of Jerusalem- \nhad been clearly defined by historic leaders. \nPopes, kings, and knights incited the peoples \nto free the Holy Land; but the people did not \ngo, for the unknown cause which had previ- \nously impelled them to go no longer existed. \nThe history of the Godfreys and the Minne- \nsingers can evidently not cover the life of the \npeoples. And the history of the Godfreys and \nthe Minnesingers has remained the history of \nGodfreys and Minnesingers, but the history of \nthe life of the peoples and their impulses has \nremained unknown. \n\nStill less does the history of authors and re- \nformers explain to us the life of the peoples. \n\nThe history of culture explains to us the \nimpulses and conditions of life and thought \nof a writer or a reformer. We learn that Luther \nhad a hot temper and said such and such \nthings; we learn that Rousseau was suspicious \nand wrote such and such books; but we do \nnot learn why after the Reformation the peo- \nples massacred one another, nor why during \nthe French Revolution they guillotined one \nanother. \n\nIf we unite both these kinds of history, as \nis done by the newest historians, we shall have \nthe history of monarchs and writers, but not \nthe history of the life of the peoples. \n\n\n\n683 \n\n\n\nCHAPTER V \n\nTHE LIFE of the nations is not contained in the \nlives of a few men, for the connection between \nthose men and the nations has not been found. \nThe theory that this connection is based on \nthe transference of the collective will of a peo- \nple to certain historical personages is an hy- \npothesis unconfirmed by the experience of his- \ntory. \n\nThe theory of the transference of the collec- \ntive will of the people to historic persons may \nperhaps explain much in the domain of juris- \nprudence and be essential for its purposes, but \nin its application to history, as soon as revolu- \ntions, conquests, or civil wars occur that is, \nas soon as history begins that theory explains \nnothing. \n\nThe theory seems irrefutable just because \n\n\n\nthe act of transference of the people's will can- \nnot be verified, for it never occurred. \n\nWhatever happens and whoever may stand \nat the head of affairs, the theory can always \nsay that such and such a person took the lead \nbecause the collective will was transferred to \nhim. \n\nThe replies this theory gives to historical \nquestions are like the replies of a man who, \nwatching the movements of a herd of cattle \nand paying no attention to the varying quality \nof the pasturage in different parts of the field, \nor to the driving of the herdsman, should at- \ntribute the direction the herd takes to what \nanimal happens to be at its head. \n\n"The herd goes in that direction because \nthe animal in front leads it and the collective \nwill of all the other animals is vested in that \nleader." This is what historians of the first \nclass say those who assume the unconditional \ntransference of the people's will. \n\n"If the animals leading the herd change, this \nhappens because the collective will of all the \nanimals is transferred from one leader to an- \nother, according to whether the animal is or \nis not leading them in the direction selected \nby the whole herd." Such is the reply of his- \ntorians who assume that the collective will of \nthe people is delegated to rulers under condi- \ntions which they regard as known. (With this \nmethod of observation it often happens that \nthe observer, influenced by the direction he \nhimself prefers, regards those as leaders who, \nowing to the people's change of direction, are \nno longer in front, but on one side, or even \nin the rear.) \n\n"If the animals in front are continually \nchanging and the direction of the whole herd \nis constantly altered, this is because in order \nto follow a given direction the animals trans- \nfer their will to the animals that have attracted \nour attention, and to study the movements of \nthe herd we must watch the movements of all \nthe prominent animals moving on all sides of \nthe herd." So say the third class of historians \nwho regard all historical persons, from mon- \narchs to journalists, as the expression of their \nage. \n\nThe theory of the transference of the will \nof the people to historic persons is merely a \nparaphrase a restatement of the question in \nother words. \n\nWhat causes historical events? Power. What \nis power? Power is the collective will of the \npeople transferred to one person. Under what \ncondition is the will of the people delegated \n\n\n\n684 WAR AND PEACE \n\nto one person? On condition that that person \nexpresses the will of the whole people. That is, \npower is power: in other words, power is a \nword the meaning of which we do not under- \nstand. \n\n\n\nIf the realm of human knowledge were con- \nfined to abstract reasoning, then having sub- \njected to criticism the explanation of "power" \nthat juridical science gives us, humanity would \nconclude that power is merely a word and has \nno real existence. But to understand phenom- \nena man has, besides abstract reasoning, ex- \nperience by which he verifies his reflections. \nAnd experience tells us that power is not mere- \nly a word but an actually existing phenomenon. \n\nNot to speak of the fact that no description \nof the collective activity of men can do with- \nout the conception of power, the existence of \npower is proved both by history and by ob- \nserving contemporary events. \n\nWhenever an event occurs a man appears or \nmen appear, by whose will the event seems to \nhave taken place. Napoleon III issues a decree \nand the French go to Mexico. The King of \nPrussia and Bismarck issue decrees and an \narmy enters Bohemia. Napoleon I issues a \ndecree and an army enters Russia. Alexander \nI gives a command and the French submit to \nthe Bourbons. Experience shows us that what- \never event occurs it is always related to the \nwill of one or of several men who have de- \ncreed it. \n\nThe historians, in accord with the old habit \nof acknowledging divine intervention in hu- \nman affairs, want to see the cause of events in \nthe expression of the will of someone endowed \nwith power, but that supposition is not con- \nfirmed either by reason or by experience. \n\nOn the one side reflection shows that the \nexpression of a man's willhis words are only \npart of the general activity expressed in an \nevent, as for instance in a war or a revolution, \nand so without assuming an incomprehensible, \nsupernatural force a miracle one cannot ad- \nmit that words can be the immediate cause of \nthe movements of millions of men. On the \nother hand, even if we admitted that words \ncould be the cause of events, history shows \nthat the expression of the will of historical \npersonages does not in most cases produce any \neffect, that is to say, their commands are often \nnot executed, and sometimes the very opposite \nof what they order occurs. \n\nWithout admitting divine intervention in \nthe affairs of humanity we cannot regard \n\n\n\n"power" as the cause of events. \n\nPower, from the standpoint of experience, \nis merely the relation that exists between the \nexpression of someone's will and the execu- \ntion of that will by others. \n\nTo explain the conditions of that relation- \nship we must first establish a conception of \nthe expression of will, referring it to man and \nnot to the Deity. \n\nIf the Deity issues a command, expresses \nHis will, as ancient history tells us, the ex- \npression of that will is independent of time \nand is not caused by anything, for the Divinity \nis not controlled by an event. But speaking of \ncommands that are the expression of the will \nof men acting in time and in relation to one \nanother, to explain the connection of com- \nmands with events we must restore: (i) the \ncondition of all that takes place: the conti- \nnuity of movement in time both of the events \nand of the person who commands, and (2) the \ninevitability of the connection between the \nperson commanding and those who execute \nhis command. \n\nCHAPTER VI \n\nONLY THE EXPRESSION of the will of the Deity, \nnot dependent on time, can relate to a whole \nseries of events occurringover a period of years \nor centuries, and only the Deity, independent \nof everything, can by His sole will determine \nthe direction of humanity's movement; but \nman acts in time and himself takes part in \nwhat occurs. \n\nReinstating the first condition omitted, that \nof time, we see that no command can be ex- \necuted without some preceding order having \nbeen given rendering the execution of the \nlast command possible. \n\nNo command ever appears spontaneously, \nor itself covers a whole series of occurrences; \nbut each command follows from another, and \nnever refers to a whole series of events but \nalways to one moment only of an event. \n\nWhen, for instance, we say that Napoleon \nordered armies to go to war, we combine in \none simultaneous expression a whole series of \nconsecutive commands dependent one on an- \nother. Napoleon could not have commanded \nan invasion of Russia and never did so. Today \nhe ordered such and such papers to be written \nto Vienna, to Berlin, and to Petersburg; to- \nmorrow such and such decrees and orders to \nthe army, the fleet, the commissariat, and so \non and so on millions of commands, which \nformed a whole series corresponding to a series \n\n\n\nof events which brought the French armies in- \nto Russia. \n\nIf throughout his reign Napoleon gave com- \nmands concerning an invasion of England and \nexpended on no other undertaking so much \ntime and effort, and yet during his whole reign \nnever once attempted to execute that design \nbut undertook an expedition into Russia, with \nwhich country he considered it desirable to be \nin alliance (a conviction he repeatedly ex- \npressed) this came about because his com- \nmands did not correspond to the course of \nevents in the first case, but did so correspond \nin the latter. \n\nFor an order to be certainly executed, it is \nnecessary that a man should order what can \nbe executed. But to know what can and what \ncannot be executed is impossible, not only in \nthe case of Napoleon's invasion of Russia in \nwhich millions participated, but even in the \nsimplest event, for in either case millions of \nobstacles may arise to prevent its execution. \nEvery order executed is always one of an im- \nmense number unexecuted. All the impossible \norders inconsistent with the course of events \nremain unexecuted. Only the possible ones \nget linked up with a consecutive series of com- \nmands corresponding to a series of events, and \nare executed. \n\nOur false conception that an event is caused \nby a command which precedes it is due to the \nfact that when the event has taken place and \nout of thousands of others those few com- \nmands which were consistent with that event \nhave been executed, we forget about the others \nthat were not executed because they could \nnot be. Apart from that, the chief source of \nour error in this matter is due to the fact that \nin the historical accounts a whole series of \ninnumerable, diverse, and petty events, such \nfor instance as all those which led the French \narmies to Russia, is generalized into one event \nin accord with the result produced by that \nseries of events, and corresponding with this \ngeneralization the whole series of commands \nis also generalized into a single expression of \nwill. \n\nWe say that Napoleon wished to invade \nRussia and invaded it. In reality in all Na- \npoleon's activity we never find anything re- \nsembling an expression of that wish, but find \na series of orders, or expressions of his will, \nvery variously and indefinitely directed. Amid \na long series of unexecuted orders of Napo- \nleon's one series, for the campaign of 1812, was \ncarried out not because those orders differed \n\n\n\nSECOND EPILOGUE 685 \n\nin any way from the other, unexecuted orders \nbut because they coincided with the course of \nevents that led the French army into Russia; \njust as in stencil work this or that figure comes \nout not because the color was laid on from this \nside or in that way, but because it was laid on \nfrom all sides over the figure cut in the stencil. \n\nSo that examining the relation in time of \nthe commands to the events, we find that a \ncommand can never be the cause of the event, \nbut that a certain definite dependence exists \nbetween the two. \n\nTo understand in what this dependence \nconsists it is necessary to reinstate another \nomitted condition of every command proceed- \ning not from the Deity but from a man, which \nis, that the man who gives the command him- \nself takes part in the event. \n\nThis relation of the commander to those \nhe commands is just what is called power. \nThis relation consists in the following: \n\nFor common action people always unite in \ncertain combinations, in which regardless of \nthe difference of the aims set for the common \naction, the relation between those taking part \nin it is always the same. \n\nMen uniting in these combinations always \nassume such relations toward one another that \nthe larger number take a more direct share, \nand the smaller number a less direct share, in \nthe collective action for which they have com- \nbined. \n\nOf all the combinations in which men unite \nfor collective action one of the most striking \nand definite examples is an army. \n\nEvery army is composed of lower grades of \nthe servicethe rank and file of whom there \nare always the greatest number; of the nexi \nhigher military rank corporals and noncom \nmissioned officers of whom there are fewer, \nand of still-higher officers of whom there are \nstill fewer, and so on to the highest military \ncommand which is concentrated in one per- \nson. \n\nA military organization may be quite cor- \nrectly compared to a cone, of which the base \nwith the largest diameter consists of the rank \nand file; the next higher and smaller section \nof the cone consists of the next higher grades \nof the army, and so on to the apex, the point \nof which will represent the commander in \nchief. \n\nThe soldiers, of whom there are the most, \nform the lower section of the cone and its \nbase. The soldier himself does the stabbing, \nhacking, burning, and pillaging, and always \n\n\n\n686 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nreceives orders for these actions from men \nabove him; he himself never gives an order. \nThe noncommissioned officers (of whom there \nare fewer) perform the action itself less fre- \nquently than the soldiers, but they already \ngive commands. An officer still less often acts \ndirectly himself, but commands still more fre- \nquently, ^general does nothing but command \n^hejroops, in^icafes~the objective, and harcfly \never uses a weapon himself. The commander \nin chief never takes direct part in the action \nitself, but only gives general orders concerning \nthe' movement of the mass of the troops. A \nsimilar relation of people to one another is \nseen in every combination of men for common \nactivityin agriculture, trade, and every ad- \nministration. \n\nAnd so without particularly analyzing all \nthe contiguous sections of a cone and of the \nranks of an army, or the ranks and positions \nin any administrative or public business what- \never from the lowest to the highest, we see a \nlaw by which men, to take associated action, \ncombine in such relations that the more di- \nrectly they participate in performing the ac- \ntion the less they can command and the more \nnumerous they are, while the less their direct \nparticipation in the action itself, the more they \ncommand and the fewer of them there are; \nrising in this way from the lowest ranks to the \nman at the top, who takes the least direct \nshare in the action and directs his activity \nchiefly to commanding. \n\nThis relation of the men who command to \nthose they command is what constitutes the \nessence of the conception called power. \n\nHaving restored the concTitiorToT time under \nwhich all events occur, we find that a command \nis executed only when it is related to a corre- \nsponding series of events. Restoring the essen- \ntial condition of relation between those who \ncommand and those who execute, we find that \nby the very nature of the case those who com- \nmand take the smallest part in the action it- \nself and that their activity is exclusively di- \nrected to commanding. \n\nCHAPTER VII \n\nWHEN AN EVENT is taking place people express \ntheir opinions and wishes about it, and as the \nevent results from the collective activity of \nmany people, some one of the opinions or \nwishes expressed is sure to be fulfilled if but \napproximately. When one of the opinions ex- \npressed is fulfilled, that opinion gets connected \nwith the event as a command preceding it. \n\n\n\nMen are hauling a log. Each of them ex- \npresses his opinion as to how and where to \nhaul it. They haul the log away, and it hap- \npens that this is done as one of them said. He \nordered it. There we have command and pow- \ner in their primary form. The man who worked \nmost with his hands could not think so much \nabout what he was doing, or reflect on or com- \nmand what would result from the common \nactivity; while the man who commanded more \nwould evidently work less with his hands on \naccount of his greater verbal activity. \n\nWhen some larger concourse of men direct \ntheir activity to a common aim there is a yet \nsharper division of those who, because their \nactivity is given to directing and commanding, \ntake less part in the direct work. \n\nWhen a man works alone he always has a \ncertain set of reflections which as it seems to \nhim directed his past activity, justify his pres- \nent activity, and guide him in planning his \nfuture actions. Just the same is done by a con- \ncourse of people, allowing those who do not \ntake a direct part in the activity to devise \nconsiderations, justifications, and surmises con- \ncerning their collective activity. \n\nFor reasons known or unknown to us the \nFrench began to drown and kill one another. \nAnd corresponding to the event its justifica- \ntion appears in people's belief that this was \nnecessary for the welfare of France, for liberty, \nand for equality. People ceased to kill one \nanother, and this event was accompanied by \nits justification in the necessity for a central- \nization of power, resistance to Europe, and so \non. Men went from the west to the east killing \ntheir fellow men, and the event was accom- \npanied by phrases about the glory of France, \nthe baseness of England, and so on. History \nshows us that these justifications of the events \nhave no common sense and are all contradic- \ntory, as in the case of killing a man as the re- \nsult of recognizing his rights, and the killing \nof millions in Russia for the humiliation of \nEngland. But these justifications have a very \nnecessary significance in their own day. \n\nThese justifications release those who pro- \nduce the events from moral responsibility. \nThese temporary aims are like the broom fixed \nin front of a locomotive to clear the snow from \nthe rails in front: they clear men's moral re- \nsponsibilities from their path. \n\nWithout such justification there would be \nno reply to the simplest question that presents \nitself when examining each historical event. \nHow is it that millions of men commit collec- \n\n\n\nSECOND EPILOGUE \n\ntive crimesmake war, commit murder, and \nso on? \n\nWith the present complex forms of political \nand social life in Europe can any event that is \nnot prescribed, decreed, or ordered by mon- \narchs, ministers, parliaments, or newspapers be \nimagined? Is there any collective action which \ncannot find its justification in political unity, \nin patriotism, in the balance of power, or in \ncivilization? So that every event that occurs \ninevitably coincides with some expressed wish \nand, receiving a justification, presents itself \nas the result of the will of one man or of \nseveral men. \n\nIn whatever direction a ship moves, the flow \nof the waves it cuts will always be noticeable \nahead of it. To those on board the ship the \nmovement of those waves will be the only per- \nceptible motion. \n\nOnly by watching closely moment by mo- \nment the movement of that flow and compar- \ning it with the movement of the ship do we \nconvince ourselves that every bit of it is oc- \ncasioned by the forward movement of the \nship, and that we were led into error by the \nfact that we ourselves were imperceptibly mov- \ning. \n\nWe see the same if we watch moment by \nmoment the movement of historical characters \n(that is, re-establish the inevitable condition \nof all that occurs the continuity of move- \nment in time) and do not lose sight of the \nessential connection of historical persons with \nthe masses. \n\nWhen the ship moves in one direction there \nis one and the same wave ahead of it, when \nit turns frequently the wave ahead of it also \nturns frequently. But wherever it may turn \nthere always will be the wave anticipating its \nmovement. \n\nWhatever happens it always appears that \njust that event was foreseen and decreed. \nWherever the ship may go, the rush of water \nwhich neither directs nor increases its move- \nment foams ahead of it, and at a distance \nseems to us not merely to move of itself but \nto govern the ship's movement also. \n\n\n\n687 \n\n\n\nExamining only those expressions of the \nwill of historical persons which, as commands, \nwere related to events, historians have assumed \nthat the events depended on those com- \nmands. But examining the events themselves \nand the connection in which the historical \npersons stood to the people, we have found \nthat they and their orders were dependent on \n\n\n\nevents. The incontestable proof of this deduc- \ntion is that, however many commands were \nissued, the event does not take place unless \nthere are other causes for it, but as soon as an \nevent occurs be it what it may then out of \nall the continually expressed wishes of dif- \nferent people some will always be found which \nby their meaning and their time of utterance \nare related as commands to the events. \n\nArriving at this conclusion we can reply di- \nrectly and positively to these two essential \nquestions of history: \n\n(1) What is power? \n\n(2) What force produces the movement of \nthe nations? \n\n(1) Power is the relation of a given person \nto other individuals, in which the more this \nperson expresses opinions, predictions, and \njustifications of the collective action that is \nperformed, the less is his participation in that \naction. \n\n(2) The movement of nations is caused not \nby power, nor by intellectual activity, nor \neven by a combination of the two as historians \nhave supposed, but by the activity of all the \npeople who participate in the events, and who \nalways combine in such a way that those tak- \ning the largest direct share in the event take \non themselves the least responsibility and vice \nversa. \n\nMorally the wi elder of power appears to \ncause the event; physically it is those who sub- \nmit to the power. But as the moral activity is \ninconceivable without the physical, the cause \nof the event is neither in the one nor in the \nother but in the union of the two. \n\nOr in other words, the conception of a cause \nis inapplicable to the phenomena we are ex- \namining. \n\nIn the last analysis we reach the circle of \ninfinity that final limit to which in every do- \nmain of thought man's reason arrives if it is \nnot playing with the subject. Electricity pro- \nduces heat, heat produces electricity. Atoms \nattract each other and atoms repel one an- \nother. \n\nSpeaking of the interaction of heat and elec- \ntricity and of atoms, we cannot say why this \noccurs, and we say that it is so because it is \ninconceivable otherwise, because it must be \nso and that it is a law. The same applies to \nhistorical events. Why war and revolution oc- \ncur we do not know. We only know that to \nproduce the one or the other action, people \ncombine in a certain formation in which they \nall take part, and we say that this is so because \n\n\n\n688 \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nit is unthinkable otherwise, or in other words \nthat it is a law. \n\nCHAPTER VIII \n\nIF HISTORY DEALT only with external phenom- \nena, the establishment of this simple and ob- \nvious law would suffice and we should have \nfinished our argument. But the law of history \nrelates to man. A particle of matter cannot tell \nus that it does not feel the law of attraction or \nrepulsion and that that law is untrue, but \nman, who is thesubject of history, says plainly: \nI am free and am therefore not subject to \nthe law. \n\nThe presence of the problem of man's free \nwill, though unexpressed, is felt at every step \nof history. \n\nAll seriously thinking historians have in- \nvoluntarily encountered this question. All the \ncontradictions and obscurities of history and \nthe false path historical science has followed \nare due solely to the lack of a solution of \nthat question. \n\nIf the will of every man were free, that is, \nif each man could act as he pleased, all history \nwould be a series of disconnected incidents. \n\nIf in a thousand years even one man in a \nmillion could act freely, that is, as he chose, \nit is evident that one single free act of that \nman's in violation of the laws governing hu- \nman action would destroy the possibility of \nthe existence of any laws for die whole of \nhumanity. \n\nIf there be a single law governing the ac- \ntions of men, free will cannot exist, for then \nman's will is subject to that law. \n\nIn this contradiction lies the problem of \nfree will, which from most ancient times has \noccupied the best human minds and from most \nancient times has been presented in its whole \ntremendous significance. \n\nThe problem is that regarding man as a sub- \nject of observation from whatever point of \nview theological, historical, ethical, or phil- \nosophicwe find a general law of necessity to \nwhich he (like all that exists) is subject. But \nregarding him from within ourselves as what \nwe are conscious of, we feel ourselves to be \nfree. \n\nThis consciousness is a source of self-cogni- \ntion quite apart from and independent of \nreason. Through his reason man observes him- \nself, but only through consciousness does he \nknow himself. \n\nApart from consciousness of self no observa- \ntion or application of reason is conceivable. \n\n\n\nTo understand, observe, and draw conclu- \nsions, man must first of all be conscious of him- \nself as living. A man is only conscious of him- \nself as a living being by the fact that he wills, \nthat is, is conscious of his volition. But his will \nwhich forms the essence of his life man \nrecognizes (and can but recognize) as free. \n\nIf, observing himself, man sees that his will \nis always directed by one and the same law \n(whether he observes the necessity of taking \nfood, using his brain, or anything else) he can- \nnot recognize this never-varying direction of \nhis will otherwise than as a limitation of it. \nWere it not free it could not be limited. A \nman's will seems to him to be limited just be- \ncause he is not conscious of it except as free. \n\nYou say: I am not free. But I have lifted my \nhand and let it fall. Everyone understands \nthat this illogical reply is an irrefutable dem- \nonstration of freedom. \n\nThat reply is the expression of a conscious- \nness that is not subject to reason. \n\nIf the consciousness of freedom were not a \nseparate and independent source of self-con- \nsciousness it would be subject to reasoning \nand to experience, but in fact such subjection \ndoes not exist and is inconceivable. \n\nA series of experiments and arguments \nproves to every man that he, as an object of \nobservation, is subject to certain laws, and man \nsubmits to them and never resists the laws of \ngravity or impermeability once he has become \nacquainted with them. But the same series of \nexperiments and arguments proves to him that \nthe complete freedom of which he is conscious \nin himself is impossible, and that his every \naction depends on his organization, his char- \nacter, and the motives acting upon him; yet \nman never submits to the deductions of these \nexperiments and arguments. Having learned \nfrom experiment and argument that a stone \nfalls downwards, a man indubitably believes \nthis and always expects the law that he has \nlearned to be fulfilled. \n\nBut learning just as certainly that his will \nis subject to laws, he does not and cannot be- \nlieve this. \n\nHowever often experiment and reasoning \nmay show a man that under the same condi- \ntions and with the same character he will do \nthe same thing as before, yet when under the \nsame conditions an&lt;} with the same character \nhe approaches for the thousandth time the ac- \ntion that always ends in the same way, he feels \nas certainly convinced as before the experi- \nment that he can act as he pleases. Every man, \n\n\n\nSECOND EPILOGUE \n\nsavage or sage, however incontestably reason \nand experiment may prove to him that it is \nimpossible to imagine two different courses \nof action in precisely the same conditions, \nfeels that without this irrational conception \n(which constitutes the essence of freedom) he \ncannot imagine life. He feels that however im- \npossible it may be, it is so, for without this \nconception of freedom not only would he be \nunable to understand life, but he would be \nunable to live for a single moment. \n\nHe could not live, because all man's efforts, \nall his impulses to life, are only efforts to in- \ncrease freedom. Wealth and poverty, fame \nand obscurity, power and subordination, \nstrength and weakness, health and disease, cul- \nture and ignorance, work and leisure, reple- \ntion and hunger, virtue and vice, are only \ngreater or lesser degrees of freedom. \n\nA man having no freedom cannot be con- \nceived of except as deprived of life. \n\nIf the conception of freedom appears to \nreason to be a senseless contradiction like the \npossibility of performing two actions at one \nand the same instant of time, or of an effect \nwithout a cause, that only proves that con- \nsciousness is not subject to reason. \n\nThis unshakable, irrefutable consciousness \nof freedom, uncontrolled by experiment or \nargument, recognized by all thinkers and felt \nby everyone without exception, this conscious- \nness without which no conception of man is \npossible constitutes the other side of the ques- \ntion. \n\nMan is the creation of an all-powerful, all- \ngood, and all-seeing God. What is sin, the \nconception of which arises from the conscious- \nness of man's freedom? That is a question for \ntheology. \n\nThe actions of men are subject to general \nimmutable laws expressed in statistics. What \nis man's responsibility to society, the concep- \ntion of which results from the conception of \nfreedom? That is a question for jurisprudence. \n\nMan's actions proceed from his innate char- \nacter and the motives acting upon him. What \nis conscience and the perception of right and \nwrong in actions that follows from the con- \nsciousness of freedom? That is a question for \nethics. \n\nMan in connection with the general life of \nhumanity appears subject to laws which de- \ntermine that life. But the same man apart from \nthat connection appears to be free. How should \nthe past life of nations and of humanity be \nregarded as the result of the free, or as the \n\n\n\n689 \n\nresult of the constrained, activity of man? That \nis a question for history. \n\nOnly in our self-confident day of the popu- \nlarization of knowledge thanks to that most \npowerful engine of ignorance, the diffusion of \nprinted matter has the question of the free- \ndom of will been put on a level on which the \nquestion itself cannot exist. In our time the \nmajority of so-called advanced people that is, \nthe crowd of ignoramuses have taken the work \nof the naturalists who deal with one side of the \nquestion for a solution of the whole problem. \n\nThey say and write and print that the soul \nand freedom do not exist, for the life of man \nis expressed by muscular movements and mus- \ncular movements are conditioned by the ac- \ntivity of the nerves; the soul and free will do \nnot exist because at an unknown period of time \nwe sprang from the apes. They say this, not at \nall suspecting that thousands of years ago that \nsame law of necessity which with such ardor \nthey are now trying to prove by physiology and \ncomparative zoology was not merely acknowl- \nedged by all the religions and all the thinkers, \nbut has never been denied. They do not see \nthat the role of the natural sciences in this \nmatter is merely to serve as an instrument for \nthe illumination of one side of it. For the fact \nthat, from the point of view of observation, \nreason and the will are merely secretions of the \nbrain, and that man following the general law \nmay have developed from lower animals at \nsome unknown period of time, only explains \nfrom a fresh side the truth admitted thousands \nof years ago by all the religious and philosophic \ntheories that from the point of view of rea- \nson man is subject to the law of necessity; but \nit does not advance by a hair's breadth the solu- \ntion of the question, which has another, oppo- \nsite, side, based on the consciousness of free- \ndom. \n\nIf men descended from the apes at an un- \nknown period of time, that is as comprehen- \nsible as that they were made from a handful of \nearth at a certain period of time (in the first \ncase the unknown quantity is the time, in the \nsecond case it is the origin); and the question \nof how man's consciousness of freedom is to \nbe reconciled with the law of necessity to \nwhich he is subject cannot be solved by com- \nparative physiology and zoology, for in a frog, \na rabbit, or an ape, we can observe only the \nmuscular nervous activity, but in man we ob- \nserve consciousness as well as the muscular and \nnervous activity. \n\nThe naturalists and their followers, think- \n\n\n\n690 WAR AND PEACE \n\ning they can solve this question, are like plas- \nterers set to plaster one side of the walls of a \nchurch who, availing themselves of the ab- \nsence of the chief superintendent of the work, \nshould in an access of zeal plaster over the \nwindows, icons, woodwork, and still unbut- \ntressed walls, and should be delighted that \nfrom their point of view as plasterers, every- \nthing is now so smooth and regular. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX \n\nFOR THE SOLUTION of the question of free will \nor inevitability, history has this advantage over \nother branches of knowledge in which the \nquestion is dealt with, that for history this \nquestion does not refer to the essence of man's \nfree will but to its manifestation in the past and \nunder certain conditions. \n\nIn regard to this question, history stands to \nthe other sciences as experimental science \nstands to abstract science. \n\nThe subject for history is not man's will \nitself but our presentation of it. \n\nAnd so for history, the insoluble mystery \npresented by the incompatibility of free will \nand inevitability does not exist as it does for \ntheology, ethics, and philosophy. History sur- \nveys a presentation of man's life in which the \nunion of these two contradictions has already \ntaken place. \n\nIn actual life each historic event, each hu- \nman action, is very clearly and definitely un- \nderstood without any sense of contradiction, \nalthough each event presents itself as partly \nfree and partly compulsory. \n\nTo solve the question of how freedom and \nnecessity are combined and what constitutes \nthe essence of these two conceptions, the phi- \nlosophy of history can and should follow a \npath contrary to that taken by other sciences. \nInstead of first defining the conceptions of free- \ndom and inevitability in themselves, and then \nranging the phenomena of life under those \ndefinitions, history should deduce a definition \nof the conception of freedom and inevitability \nthemselves from the immense quantity of phe- \nnomena of which it is cognizant and that al- \nways appear dependent on these two elements. \n\nWhatever presentation of the activity of \nmany men or of an individual we may con- \nsider, we always regard it as the result partly \nof man's free will and partly of the law of in- \nevitability. \n\nWhether we speak of the migration of the \npeoples and the incursions of the barbarians, \nor of the decrees of Napoleon HI, or of some- \n\n\n\none's action an hour ago in choosing one direc- \ntion out of several for his walk, we are uncon- \nscious of any contradiction, The degree of free- \ndom and inevitability governing the actions \nof these people is clearly defined for us. \n\nOur conception of the degree of freedom \noften varies according to differences in the \npoint of view from which we regard the event, \nbut every human action appears to us as a \ncertain combination of freedom and inevita- \nbility. In every action we examine we see a \ncertain measure of freedom and a certain \nmeasure of inevitability. And always the more \nfreedom we see in any action the less inevita- \nbility do we perceive, and the more inevitabil- \nity the less freedom. \n\nThe proportion of freedom to inevitability \ndecreases and increases according to the point \nof view from which the action is regarded, but \ntheir relation is always one of inverse propor- \ntion. \n\nA sinking man who clutches at another and \ndrowns him; or a hungry mother exhausted by \nfeeding her baby, who steals some food; or a \nman trained to discipline who on duty at the \nword of command kills a defenseless man- \nseem less guilty, that is, less free and more \nsubject to the law of necessity, to one who \nknows the circumstances in which these peo- \nple were placed, and more free to one who does \nnot know that the man was himself drowning, \nthat the mother was hungry, that the soldier \nwas in the ranks, and so on. Similarly a man \nwho committed a murder twenty years ago \nand has since lived peaceably and harmlessly \nin society seems less guilty and his action more \ndue to the law of inevitability, to someone who \nconsiders his action after twenty years have \nelapsed than to one who examined it the day \nafter it was committed. And in the same way \nevery action of an insane, intoxicated, or high- \nly excited man appears less free and more in- \nevitable to one who knows the mental condi- \ntion of him who committed the action, and \nseems more free and less inevitable to one who \ndoes not know it. In all these cases the con- \nception of freedom is increased or diminished \nand the conception of compulsion is corre- \nspondingly decreased or increased, according \nto the point of view from which the action is \nregarded. So that the greater the conception ol \nnecessity the smaller the conception of free- \ndom and vice versa. \n\nReligion, the common sense of mankind, \nthe science of jurisprudence, and history it \nself understand alike this relation between \n\n\n\nSECOND EPILOGUE \n\nnecessity and freedom. \n\nAll cases without exception in which our \nconception of freedom and necessity is in- \ncreased and diminished depend on three con- \nsiderations: \n\n(1) The relation to the external world of \nthe man who commits the deeds. \n\n(2) His relation to time. \n\n(3) His relation to the causes leading to the \naction. \n\nThe first consideration is the clearness of \nour perception of the man's relation to the \nexternal world and the greater or lesser clear- \nness of our understanding of the definite posi- \ntion occupied by the man in relation to every- \nthing coexisting with him. This is what makes \nit evident that a drowning man is less free and \nmore subject to necessity than one standing on \ndry ground, and that makes the actions of a \nman closely connected with others in a thickly \npopulated district, or of one bound by family, \nofficial, or business duties, seem certainly less \nfree and more subject to necessity than those \nof a man living in solitude and seclusion. \n\nIf we consider a man alone, apart from his \nrelation to everything around him, each ac- \ntion of his seems to us free. But if we see his \nrelation to anything around him, if we see his \nconnection with anything whatever with a \nman who speaks to him, a book he reads, the \nwork on which he is engaged, even with the \nair he breathes or the light that falls on the \nthings about him we see that each of these \ncircumstances has an influence on him and \ncontrols at least some side of his activity. And \nthe more we perceive of these influences the \nmore our conception of his freedom dimin- \nishes and the more our conception of the neces- \nsity that weighs on him increases. \n\nThe second consideration is the more or less \nevident time relation of the man to the world \nand the clearness of our perception of the \nplace the man's action occupies in time. That \nis the ground which makes the fall of the first \nman, resulting in the production of the hu- \nman race, appear evidently less free than a \nman's entry into marriage today. It is the \nreason why the life and activity of people who \nlived centuries ago and are connected with \nme in time cannot seem to me as free as the life \nof a contemporary, the consequences of which \nare still unknown to me. \n\nThe degree of our conception of freedom or \ninevitability depends in this respect on the \ngreater or lesser lapse of time between the per- \nformance of the action and our judgment of it. \n\n\n\n691 \n\nIf I examine an act I performed a moment \nago in approximately the same circumstances \nas those I am in now, my action appears to me \nundoubtedly free. But if I examine an act \nperformed a month ago, then being in differ- \nent circumstances, I cannot help recognizing \nthat if that act had not been committed much \nthat resulted from it good, agreeable, and \neven essential would not have taken place. If \nI reflect on an action still more remote, ten \nyears ago or more, then the consequences of my \naction are still plainer to me and I find it hard \nto imagine what would have happened had \nthat action not been performed. The farther \nI go back in memory, or what is the same thing \nthe farther I go forward in my judgment, the \nmore doubtful becomes my belief in the free- \ndom of my action. \n\nIn history we find a very similar progress of \nconviction concerning the part played by free \nwill in the general affairs of humanity. A con- \ntemporary event seems to us to be indubitably \nthe doing of all the known participants, but \nwith a more remote event we already see its in- \nevitable results which prevent our considering \nanything else possible. And the farther we go \nback in examining events the less arbitrary do \nthey appear. \n\nThe Austro-Prussian war appears to us un- \ndoubtedly the result of the crafty conduct of \nBismarck, and so on. The Napoleonic wars \nstill seem to us, though already questionably, \nto be the outcome of their heroes' will. But \nin the Crusades we already see an event occupy- \ning its definite place in history and without \nwhich we cannot imagine the modern history \nof Europe, though to the chroniclers of the \nCrusades that event appeared as merely due to \nthe will of certain people. In regard to the \nmigration of the peoples it does not enter any- \none's head today to suppose that the renova- \ntion of the European world depended on At- \ntila's caprice. The farther back in history the \nobject of our observation lies, the more doubt- \nful does the free will of those concerned in \nthe event become and the more manifest the \nlaw of inevitability. \n\nThe third consideration is the degree to \nwhich we apprehend that endless chain of cau- \nsation inevitably demanded by reason, in \nwhich each phenomenon comprehended, and \ntherefore man's every action, must have its \ndefinite place as a result of what has gone be- \nfore and as a cause of what will follow. \n\nThe better we are acquainted with the physi- \nological, psychological) and historical laws de- \n\n\n\n69* \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\nduced by observation and by which man is con- \ntrolled, and the more correctly we perceive \nthe physiological, psychological, and historical \ncauses of the action, and the simpler the action \nwe are observing and the less complex the \ncharacter and mind of the man in question, \nthe more subject to inevitability and the less \nfree do our actions and those of others appear. \n\nWhen we do not at all understand the cause \nof an action, whether a crime, a good action, \nor even one that is simply nonmoral, we ascribe \na greater amount of freedom to it. In the case \nof a crime we most urgently demand the pun- \nishment for such an act; in the case of a virtu- \nous act we rate its merit most highly. In an \nindifferent case we recognize in it more indi- \nviduality, originality, and independence. But \nif even one of the innumerable causes of the \nact is known to us we recognize a certain ele- \nment of necessity and are less insistent on pun- \nishment for the crime, or the acknowledgment \nof the merit of the virtuous act, or the freedom \nof the apparently original action. That a crimi- \nnal was reared among malefactors mitigates his \nfault in our eyes. The self-sacrifice of a father \nor mother, or self-sacrifice with the possibility \nof a reward, is more comprehensible than gra- \ntuitous self-sacrifice, and therefore seems less \ndeserving of sympathy and less the result of \nfree will. The founder of a sect or party, or an \ninventor, impresses us less when we know how \nor by what the way was prepared for his activ- \nity. If we have a large range of examples, if \nour observation is constantly directed to seek- \ning the correlation of cause and effect in peo- \nple's actions, their actions appear to us more \nunder compulsion and less free the more cor- \nrectly we connect the effects with the causes. \nIf we examined simple actions and had a vast \nnumber of such actions under observation, our \nconception of their inevitability would be still \ngreater. The dishonest conduct of the son of \na dishonest father, the misconduct of a woman \nwho had fallen into bad company, a drunkard's \nrelapse into drunkenness, and so on are ac- \ntions that seem to us less free the better we \nunderstand their cause. If the man whose ac- \ntions we are considering is on a very low stage \nof mental development, like a child, a mad- \nman, or a simpleton then, knowing the causes \nof the act and the simplicity of the character \nand intelligence in question, we see so large \nan element of necessity and so little free will \nthat as soon as we know the cause prompting \nthe action we can foretell the result. \n\nOn these three considerations alone is based \n\n\n\nthe conception of irresponsibility for crimes \nand the extenuating circumstances admitted \nby all legislative codes. The responsibility ap- \npears greater or less according to our greater \nor lesser knowledge of the circumstances in \nwhich the man was placed whose action is \nbeing judged, and according to the greater or \nlesser interval of time between the commission \nof the action and its investigation, and accord- \ning to the greater or lesser understanding of \nthe causes that led to the action. \n\nCHAPTER X \n\nTHUS OUR CONCEPTION of free will and inevita- \nbility gradually diminishes or increases ac- \ncording to the greater or lesser connection \nwith the external world, the greater or lesser \nremoteness of time, and the greater or lesser \ndependence on the causes in relation to which \nwe contemplate a man's life. \n\nSo that if we examine the case of a man \nwhose connection with the external world is \nwell known, where the time between the action \nand its examination is great, and where the \ncauses of the action are most accessible, we get \nthe conception of a maximum of inevitability \nand a minimum of free will. If we examine a \nman little dependent on external conditions, \nwhose action was performed very recently, and \nthe causes of whose action are beyond our \nken, we get the conception of a minimum of \ninevitability and a maximum of freedom. \n\nIn neither case however we may change \nour point of view, however plain we may make \nto ourselves the connection between the man \nand the external world, however inaccessible \nit may be to us, however long or short the \nperiod of time, however intelligible or incom- \nprehensible the causes of the action may be \ncan we ever conceive either complete freedom \nor complete necessity. \n\n(i) To whatever degree we may imagine a \nman to be exempt from the influence of the \nexternal world, we never get a conception of \nfreedom in space. Every human action is in- \nevitably conditioned by what surrounds him \nand by his own body. I lift my arm and let it \nfall. My action seems to me free; but asking \nmyself whether I could raise my arm in every \ndirection, I see that I raised it in the direction \nin which there was least obstruction to that \naction either from things around me or from \nthe construction of my own body. I chose one \nout of all the possible directions because in \nit there were fewest obstacles. For my action to \nbe free it was necessary that it should encoun- \n\n\n\nSECOND EPILOGUE \n\nter no obstacles. To conceive of a man being \nfree we must imagine him outside space, which \nis evidently impossible. \n\n(*) However much we approximate the time \nof judgment to the time of the deed, we never \nget a conception of freedom in time. For if I \nexamine an action committed a second ago I \nmust still recognize it as not being free, for it \nis irrevocably linked to the moment at which \nit was committed. Can I lift my arm? I lift it, \nbut ask myself: could I have abstained from \nlifting my arm at the moment that has already \npassed? To convince myself of this I do not lift \nit the next moment. But I am not now abstain- \ning from doing so at the first moment when I \nasked the question. Time has gone by which \nI could not detain, the arm I then lifted is no \nlonger the same as the arm I now refrain from \nlifting, nor is the air in which I lifted it the \nsame that now surrounds me. The moment in \nwhich the first movement was made is irrevoca- \nble, and at that moment I could make only \none movement, and whatever movement I \nmade would be the only one. That I did not \nlift my arm a moment later does not prove that \nI could have abstained from lifting it then. \nAnd since I could make only one movement at \nthat single moment of time, it could not have \nbeen any other. To imagine it as free, it is \nnecessary to imagine it in the present, on the \nboundary between the past and the future \nthat is, outside time, which is impossible. \n\n(3) However much the difficulty of under- \nstanding the causes may be increased, we never \nreach a conception of complete freedom, that \nis, an absence ot cause. However inaccessible \nto us may be the cause of the expression of will \nin any action, our own or another's, the first \ndemand of reason is the assumption of and \nsearch for a cause, for without a cause no phe- \nnomenon is conceivable. I raise my arm to \nperform an action independently of any cause, \nbut my wish to perform an action without a \ncause is the cause of my action. \n\nBut even if imagining a man quite exempt \nfrom all influences, examining only his mo- \nmentary action in the present, unevoked by \nany cause we were to admit so infinitely small \na remainder of inevitability as equaled zero, \nwe should even then not have arrived at the \nconception of complete freedom in man, for a \nbeing uninfluenced by the external world, \nstanding outside of time and independent of \ncause, is no longer a man. \n\nIn the same way we can never imagine the \naction of a man quite devoid of freedom and \n\n\n\n693 \n\nentirely subject to the law of inevitability. \n\n(i) However we may increase our knowl- \nedge of the conditions of space in which man \nis situated, that knowledge can never be com- \nplete, for the number of those conditions is as \ninfinite as the infinity of space. And therefore \nso long as not all the conditions influencing \nmen are defined, there is no complete inevita- \nbility but a certain measure of freedom re- \nmains. \n\n(a) However we may prolong the period' of \ntime between the action we are examining and \nthe judgment upon it, that period will be \nfinite, while time is infinite, and so in this re- \nspect too there can never be absolute inevita- \nbility. \n\n(3) However accessible may be the chain of \ncausation of any action, we shall never know \nthe whole chain since it is endless, and so again \nwe never reach absolute inevitability. \n\nBut besides this, even if, admitting the re- \nmaining minimum of freedom to equal zero, \nwe assumed in some given case as for instance \nin that of a dying man, an unborn babe, or an \nidiot complete absence of freedom, by so do- \ning we should destroy the very conception of \nman in the case we are examining, for as soon \nas there is no freedom there is also no man. \nAnd so the conception of the action of a man \nsubject solely to the law of inevitability with- \nout any element of freedom is just as impossi- \nble as the conception of a man's completely \nfree action. \n\nAnd so to imagine the action of a man en- \ntirely subject to the law of inevitability with- \nout any freedom, we must assume the knowl- \nedge of an infinite number of space relations, \nan infinitely long period of time, and an in- \nfinite series of causes. \n\nTo imagine a man perfectly free and not \nsubject to the law of inevitability, we must \nimagine him all alone, beyond space, beyond \ntime, and free from dependence on cause. \n\nIn the first case, if inevitability were possible \nwithout freedom we should have reached a \ndefinition of inevitability by the laws of in- \nevitability itself, that is, a mere form without \ncontent. \n\nIn the second case, if freedom were possible \nwithout inevitability we should have arrived \nat unconditioned freedom beyond space, time, \nand cause, which by the fact of its being un- \nconditioned and unlimited would be nothing, \nor mere content without form. * \n\nWe should in fact have reached those two \nfundamentals of which man's whole outlook \n\n\n\n694 WAR AND PEACE \n\non the universe is constructedthe incompre- \nhensible essence of life, and the laws defining \nthat essence. \n\nReason says: (i) space with all the forms of \nmatter that give it visibility is infinite, and \ncannot be imagined otherwise. (2) Time is \ninfinite motion without a moment of rest and \nis unthinkable otherwise. (3) The connection \nbetween cause and effect has no beginning and \ncan have no end. \n\nConsciousness says: (i) I alone am, and all \nthat exists is but me, consequently I include \nspace. (2) I measure flowing time by the fixed \nmoment of the present in which alone I am \nconscious of myself as living, consequently I \nam outside time. (3) I am beyond cause, for I \nfeel myself to be the cause of every manifesta- \ntion of my life. \n\nReason gives expression to the laws of in- \nevitability. Consciousness gives expression to \nthe essence of freedom. \n\nFreedom not limited by anything is the es- \nsence of life, in man's consciousness. Inevita- \nbility without content is man's reason in its \nthree forms. \n\nFreedom is the thing examined. Inevitabil- \nity is what examines. Freedom is the content. \nInevitability is the form. \n\nOnly by separating the two sources of cogni- \ntion, related to one another as form to con- \ntent, do we get the mutually exclusive and \nseparately incomprehensible conceptions of \nfreedom and inevitability. \n\nOnly by uniting them do we get a clear con- \nception of man's life. \n\nApart from these two concepts which in \ntheir union mutually define one another as \nform and content, no conception of life is \npossible. \n\nAll that we know of the life of man is merely \na certain relation of free will to inevitability, \nthat is, of consciousness to the laws of reason. \n\nAll that we know of the external world of \nnature is only a certain relation of the forces \nof nature to inevitability, or of the essence of \nlife to the laws of reason. \n\nThe great natural forces lie outside us and \nwe are not conscious of them; we call those \nforces gravitation, inertia, electricity, animal \nforce, and so on, but we are conscious of the \nforce of life in man and we call that freedom. \n\nBut just as the force of gravitation, incom- \nprehensible in itself but felt by every man, is \nunderstood by us only to the extent to which \nwe know the laws of inevitability to which it \nis subject (from the first knowledge that all \n\n\n\nbodies have weight, up to Newton's law), so \ntoo the force of free will, incomprehensible in \nitself but of which everyone is conscious, is in- \ntelligible to us only in as far as we know the \nlaws of inevitability to which it is subject \n(from the fact that every man dies, up to the \nknowledge of the most complex economic and \nhistoric laws). \n\nAll knowledge is merely a bringing of this \nessence of life under the laws of reason. \n\nMan's free will differs from every other force \nin that man is directly conscious of it, but in \nthe eyes of reason it in no way differs from any \nother force. The forces of gravitation, electric- \nity, or chemical affinity are only distinguished \nfrom one another in that they are differently \ndefined by reason. Just so the force of man's \nfree will is distinguished by reason from the \nother forces of natureonly by the definition rea- \nson gives it. Freedom, apart from necessity, \nthat is, apart from the laws of reason that de- \nfine it, differs in no way from gravitation, or \nheat, or the force that makes things grow; for \nreason, it is only a momentary undefinable sen- \nsation of life. \n\nAnd as the undefinable essence of the force \nmoving the heavenly bodies, the undefinable \nessence of the forces of heat and electricity, or \nof chemical affinity, or of the vital force, forms \nthe content of astronomy, physics, chemistry, \nbotany, zoology, and so on, just in the same \nway does the force of free will form the con- \ntent of history. But just as the subject of every \nscience is the manifestation of this unknown \nessence of life while that essence itself can only \nbe the subject of metaphysics, even so the mani- \nfestation of the force of free will in human be- \nings in space, in time, and in dependence on \ncause forms the subject of history, while free \nwill itself is the subject of metaphysics. \n\nIn the experimental sciences what we know \nwe call the laws of inevitability, what is un- \nknown to us we call vital force. Vital force is \nonly an expression lor the unknown remainder \nover and above what we know of the essence \nof life. \n\nSo also in history what is known to us we \ncall laws of inevitability, what is unknown we \ncall free will. Free will is for history only an \nexpression for the unknown remainder of what \nwe know about the laws of human life. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI \n\nHISTORY EXAMINES the manifestations of man's \nfree will in connection with the external world \nin time and in dependence on cause, that is, \n\n\n\nSECOND EPILOGUE \n\nit defines this freedom by the laws of reason, \nand so history is a science only in so far as \nthis free will is defined by those laws. \n\nThe recognition of man's free will as some- \nthing capable of influencing historical events, \nthat is, as not subject to laws, is the same for \nhistory as the recognition of a free force mov- \ning the heavenly bodies would be for astron- \nomy. \n\n1'hat assumption would destroy the possi- \nbility of the existence of la\^, that is, of any \nscience whatever. If there is even a single body \nmoving freely, then the laws of Kepler and \nNewton are negatived and no conception of \nthe movement of the heavenly bodies any \nlonger exists. If any single action is due to free \nwill, then not a single historical law can exist, \nnor any conception of historical events. \n, For history, lines exist of the movement of \nhuman wills, one end of which is hidden in the \nunknown but at the other end of which a con- \nsciousness of man's will in the present moves \nin space, time, and dependence on cause. \n\nThe more this field of motion spreads out \nbefore our eyes, the more evident are the laws \nof that movement. To discover and define those \nlaws is the problem of history. \n\nFrom the standpoint from which the science \nof history now regards its subject on the path it \nnow follows, seeking the causes of events in \nman's freewill, a scientific enunciation of those \nlaws is impossible, for however man's free will \nmay be restricted, as soon as we recognize it as \na force not subject to law, the existence of law \nbecomes impossible. \n\nOnly by reducing this element of free will \nto the infinitesimal, that is, by regarding it as \nan infinitely small quantity, can we convince \nourselves of the absolute inaccessibility of the \ncauses, and then instead of seeking causes, his- \ntory will take the discovery of laws as its \nproblem. \n\nThe search for these laws has long been be- \ngun and the new methods of thought which \nhistory must adopt are being worked out si- \nmultaneously with the self-destruction toward \nwhichever dissecting and dissecting the causes \nof phenomenathe old method of history is \nmoving. \n\nAll human sciences have traveled along that \npath. Arriving at infinitesimals, mathematics, \nthe most exact of sciences, abandons the proc- \ness of analysis and enters on the new process \nof the integration of unknown, infinitely small, \nquantities. Abandoning the conception of \ncause, mathematics seeks law, that is, the prop- \n\n\n\n695 \n\nerty common to all unknown, infinitely small, \nelements. \n\nIn another form but along the same path of \nreflection the other sciences have proceeded. \nWhen Newton enunciated the law of gravity \nhe did not say that the sun or the earth had a \nproperty of attraction; he said that all bodies \nfrom the largest to the smallest have the prop- \nerty of attracting one another, that is, leaving \naside the question of the cause of the move- \nment of the bodies, he expressed the property \ncommon to all bodies from the infinitely large \nto the infinitely sraall.The same is done by the \nnatural sciences: leaving aside the question of \ncause, they seek for laws. History stands on the \nsame path. And if history has for its object the \nstudy of the movement of the nations and of \nhumanity and not the narration of episodes in \nthe lives of individuals, it too, setting aside the \nconception of cause, should seek the laws com- \nmon to all the inseparably interconnected in- \nfinitesimal elements of free will. \n\nCHAPTER XII \n\nFROM THE TIME the law of Copernicus was dis- \ncovered and proved, the mere recognition of \nthe fact that it was not the sun but the earth \nthat moves sufficed to destroy the whole cos- \nmography of the ancients. By disproving that \nlaw it might have been possible to retain the \nold conception of the movements of the bodies, \nbut without disproving it, it would seem im- \npossible to continue studying the Ptolemaic \nworlds. But even after the discovery of the law \nof Copernicus the Ptolemaic worlds were still \nstudied for a long time. \n\nFrom the time the first person said and \nproved that the number of births or of crimes \nis subject to mathematical laws, and that this \nor that mode of government is determined by \ncertain geographical and economic conditions, \nand that certain relations of population to soil \nproduce migrations of peoples, the foundations \non which history had been built were destroyed \nin their essence. \n\nBy refuting these new laws the former view \nof history might have been retained; but with- \nout refuting them it would seem impossible to \ncontinue studying historic events as the results \nof man's free will. For if a certain mode of gov- \nernment was established or certain migrations \nof peoples took place in consequence of such \nand such geographic, ethnographic, or eco- \nnomic conditions, then the free will of those \nindividuals who appear to us to have estab- \nlished that mode of government or occasioned \n\n\n\n696 \n\nthe migrations can no longer be regarded as \nthe cause. \n\nAnd yet the former history continues to be \nstudied side by side with the laws of statistics, \ngeography, political economy, comparative \nphilology, and geology, which directly contra- \ndict its assumptions. \n\nThe struggle between the old views and the \nnew was long and stubbornly fought out in \nphysical philosophy. Theology stood on guard \nfor the old views and accused the new of vio- \nlating revelation. But when truth conquered, \ntheology established itself just as firmly on the \nnew foundation. \n\nJust as prolonged and stubborn is the strug- \ngle now proceeding between the old and the \nnew conception of history, and theology in the \nsame way stands on guard for the old view, and \naccuses the new view of subverting revelation. \n\nIn the one case as in the other, on both sides \nthe struggle provokes passion and stifles truth. \nOn the one hand there is fear and regret for \nthe loss of the whole edifice constructed through \nthe ages, on the other is the passion for de- \nstruction. \n\nTo the men who fought against the rising \ntruths of physical philosophy, it seemed that \nif they admitted that truth it would destroy \nfaith in God, in the creation of the firmament, \nand in the miracle of Joshua the son of Nun. \nTo the defenders of the laws of Copernicus and \nNewton, to Voltaire for example, it seemed \nthat the laws of astronomy destroyed religion, \nand he utilized the law of gravitation as a \nweapon against religion. \n\nJust so it now seems as if we have only to \nadmit the law of inevitability, to destroy the \nconception of the soul, of good and evil, and \nall the institutions of state and church that \nhave been built up on those conceptions. \n\nSo too, like Voltaire in his time, uninvited \n\n\n\nWAR AND PEACE \n\n\n\ndefenders of the law of inevitability today use \nthat law as a weapon against religion, though \nthe law of inevitability in history, like the law \nof Copernicus in astronomy, far from de- \nstroying,- even strengthens the foundation on \nwhich the institutions of state and church are \nerected. \n\nAs in the question of astronomy then, so in \nthe question of history now, the whole differ- \nence of opinion is based on the recognition or \nnonrecognition pf something absolute, serv- \ning as the measure of visible phenomena. In \nastronomy it was the immovability of the \nearth, in history it is the independence of per- \nsonalityfree will. \n\nAs with astronomy the difficulty of recogniz- \ning the motion of the earth lay in abandoning \nthe immediate sensation of the earth's fixity \nand of the motion of the planets, so in history \nthe difficulty of recognizing the subjection of \npersonality to the laws of space, time, and cause \nlies in renouncing the direct feeling of the in- \ndependence of one's own personality. But as \nin astronomy the new view said: "It is true that \nwe do not feel the movement of the earth, but \nby admitting its immobility we arrive at ab- \nsurdity, while by admitting its motion (which \nwe do not feel) we arrive at laws," so also in \nhistory the new view says: "It is true that we \nare not conscious of our dependence, but by \nadmitting our free will we arrive at absurdity, \nwhile by admitting our dependence on the \nexternal world, on time, and on cause, we \narrive at laws." \n\nIn the first case it was necessary to renounce \nthe consciousness of an unreal immobility in \nspace and to recognize a motion we did not \nfeel; in the present case it is similarly necessary \nto renounce a freedom that does not exist, and \nto recognize a dependence of which we are \nnot conscious. \n\n\n\nPRINTED IN THE U.S.A. \n\n\n\n
